D.","25 years work of Saratov Central Station of plant-breeding and genetics.","Sotsialisticheskoe Zernovoe Khozyaistvo","","","","","Among the achievements of the station in wheat breeding one of the most outstanding referred to is the production of the spring wheat Lutescens 062 by individual plant selection. This variety has yielded an average of 14.3 c. per ha. over a period of nineteen years and on account of its drought resistance has outyielded the local "" Poltavka "" in the seven worst drought years by 34.2 per cent. Various other varieties both of T. vulgare and T. durum have been produced by the same method, e.g.-Erythrospermum 0341 and T. durum hordeiforme 0432. By interspecific crossing the famous varieties Sarrubra and Sarrosa have been obtained from crosses of T. vulgare (Poltavka) and T. durum (Beloturka). These varieties are distinguished by their high drought resistance; in yield they have surpassed the two parents by 25.4 and 32.1 per cent respectively and are more or less equal to Lutescens 062, which they distinctly excel in milling and baking quality. Sarrubra is free from shedding when standing in the field and is suitable for combine harvesting; the area under this variety is constantly increasing. Other promising hybrids have been produced from later crosses of the same combination of species. Among these is an awnless T. durum equal to the standards in yield and earlier in maturity. Promising results have also been obtained from interracial crosses in T. vulgare and certain varieties resistant to smut and leaf rust have been produced. In winter wheat equally successful results have been obtained. The variety Lutescens 0329 is characterized by exceptional cold resistance, and is closely followed by Lutescens 1060/10; these two varieties have made possible a considerable extension of wheat cultivation in the lower Volga basin. Various newer hybrids are equally, if not more, promising. Many of the hybrids with rye are highly promising in respect of cold and drought resistance, yield and grain quality. The main characteristics of the forms that have proved most popular in cultivation are described. Some of them are equal to rye in earliness of maturity and exceed the standard wheat varieties in yield. They are being further crossed among themselves and with winter wheat and the amphidiploids obtained are also being used in crossing. Perennial rye is also being crossed with winter wheats in the attempt to produce perennial wheats. The same object is pursued in the crosses between Agropyrum and wheat. Some of these hybrids are at the same time possessed of great winter-hardiness and resistance both to drought and to many fungous diseases, and are also tolerant of very unfavourable growth conditions. The hybrids of A. elongaium contain the highest proportion of perennial plants in the later generations. Valuable hardy lines of both annual and perennial type have been isolated and some of these are now in the stage of variety testing. Sunflowers resistant to Orobanche and also to moth and drought have been produced by selection. A valuable new form, No. 169, possesses in addition to these characters, high yielding ability and ripens in 95-104 days, giving also a satisfactory oil content. An early variety ripening in 78 days, also resistant to Orobanche and moth has been selected, and various interesting lines have been obtained by inbreeding. One of these, No. 137 is superior both in yield and oil content and is at the same time rust-resistant. Sunflower crosses have been made, including one between the variety No. 169 and the perennial wild species Helianthus divaricatus; the hybrids are resistant to drought, rust and other fungous diseases, and include a perennial oil form which is receiving attention. Improved strains of rye have been selected and constant lines have been obtained by inbreeding which exceed the standard in yield by 6 to 60 per cent. Crosses have been effected also between rye and Agropyrum Cristatum. Millet has been subjected to selection and improved lines produced, including one No. 853, which is drought-resistant, uniform in ripening, free from shedding, good in grain quality, and unusually high in yield.","1936","2015-06-03 04:39:42","2015-06-03 06:40:45","","131-42","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19371600085","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparative analyses have been made of the meteorological conditions over a period of years and of the yields of winter rye and spring wheat, and it has been possible to define those conditions which lead to the best yields in each. The influence of various cultural measures, rotations and other operations on moisture conservation has been studied by the Saratov institute. A number of new and improved varieties suitable for these conditions have been produced and are described The spring wheat Lutescens 15/12 is a product of complex hybridization, characterized by rapid development of the root system and rapid gain in dry weight in the developing grain; it is free from shedding, high in grain quality and exceeds Sarrubra in yield by up to 5 c. per ha. The spring wheat Albidum 43, the most drought resistant yet produced, is also a product of complex hybridization, and has a high rate of development of the primary and secondary roots, rapid filling of the grain and very uniform grain; it is free from shedding and has exceeded the standard by 2-2.5 c. per ha. in yield New spring wheats for irrigated land are Lutescens 605 and 758, and the best winter wheat yet produced is the rye-wheat hybrid Lutescens 230, distinguished by its winter hardiness, standing capacity, and large vitreous grains of high baking quality. Good results have been obtained with new varieties of other crops, such as Volzanka No. 7 winter rye; sunflowers with improved oil content such as Saratov No. 19, P-10, P4 and P-27, the last being a very early variety maturing in 77 days; and the millet Saratov Cream 311, characterized by a high extraction rate of 85%.

Among them Micraspis discolor was the most dominant species comprising about 92.9% of the total ladybird beetle populations. Their relative abundance was highest in the rice fields with ponding water (37.73 %), followed by rice fields without ponding water (22.05%), rice seedbed (12.50%), grassy fallow fields (10.23%), fields with rice ratoons (7.95%), grassy road-sides (6.59%), and the least on rice bunds with grasses (2.95%). Micraspis discolor appeared to prefer rice than grasses, and rice fields with water than without water. At the flowering stage, adult M. discolor remained active on the rice panicle throughout the day but its abundance was influenced by some physical factors. It appeared that temperature and sunlight had positive influence, and rainfall and relative humidity had negative influence on the abundance of adult M. discolor on rice panicles. Observations indicated that sampling of M. discolor on emerging rice panicles can be done at any time of the day except during rain. At the flowering stage they fed on rice pollen, but their feeding even by high populations (20 adults/hill) did not cause grain sterility.","June-December  2001","2015-06-03 04:49:36","2015-06-03 04:49:36","","55-66","","1-2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ZOOREC:ZOOR13900002232","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the objective of the present study is to measure arsenic content in different parts of rice and paddy soils, and eventually explain the arsenic distribution in ratoon rice, including its relationship to the soil. Arsenic levels of rice in grains, straws, roots, and soils were obtained from 15 rice paddies, selected based on different arsenic soil concentrations ranging from 67 to 438 mg kg(-1) (n = 15). The mean arsenic content in grains was measured at 0.20 mg kg(-1) (n = 60) and the highest grain arsenic of the survey was at 1.183 mg kg(-1). Meanwhile, the mean total arsenic levels were 244 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in root and 4.4 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in straw. In comparison, regression of topsoil arsenic levels with rice grains (r (2) = 0.00) and straws (r (2) = 0.56) were less significant compared to that with rice roots (r (2) = 0.93), and the mean arsenic level in rice from root to grain was also shown to have a decreasing trend. Though concentrations of arsenic in compositive rice grain each field did not exceed food hygiene concentration limit, arsenic level in root strongly depended on arsenic concentrations of soil suggesting that the high arsenic concentration may have the potential for translocation from root to grain which ultimately effects on the human health.","2013","2015-06-03 04:09:13","2015-06-03 06:42:22","","11-18","","1","13","","Paddy Water Environ.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Arsenic; Arsenic concentration; Arsenic-contaminated sites; Arsenic content; Chemical contamination; Concentration limits; Food safety; FPXRF; Grain (agricultural product); Hot springs; relevant; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; Soil concentrations; Soil contamination; soil pollution; soils; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other achievements are sunflowers with high oil content and immunity to a number of diseases and pests, resulting from interspecific crosses. Of the 30 promising maize hybrids, a number are derived from male-sterile parents and corresponding wheat hybrids show yield increases of 30-40%; all the Triticum-Agropyron hybrids excel the standards in standing capacity and recent ones such as PPG391 and PPG56 yield over 40 c. per ha. without lodging; PPG172 is also resistant to drought, shedding and brown and yellow rust, yielding up to 55.4 c. per ha. under irrigation. The advantages of polyploidy are exemplified by triploid sugar beets, tetraploid rye and rye-wheat amphidiploids; three perennial Triticum-Agropyron hybrids give 2-3 yields without resowing and are resistant to frost and disease, though yielding less grain than the common wheat cultivars; a description is given of 1345, which, when sown in autumn, gives three crops of hay with a protein content of 12-14%, the total yield of which is 90-100 c., after which it can be grazed; other Triticum-Agropyron hybrids, with branching ears, contain over 100 grains per ear. A perennial rye, Pervenec [Firstborn], gives a crop in three successive years almost equal to that from normal rye. Incompatibility has been overcome in interspecific tobacco crosses by polyploidy, in crosses of cabbage with radish by grafting, which also induces flowering in the first year; an interspecific potato hybrid contains 23-5% starch and 3% protein; successful cultivars of pea and French bean have been produced by interspecific hybridization and others by crossing between ecotypes.","1967","2015-06-03 04:37:37","2015-06-03 06:42:58","","5-14","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19681601994","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preliminary communication.","Trudy Azovo-Cernomor. Selek-cent.","","","","","Sterility of the F 1 hybrids between Triticum and Agropyron is due to (1) frequent anomalies in pre-meiotic and mitotic divisions of the pollen mother-cells, (2) incomplete and casual conjugation of chromosomes, the number of bivalents varying from 0 to 2 ( T. durum X 28 chromo- some A. intermedium) to 19 to 23 ( T. vulgare x A. elongatum) and (3) irregular pollen-grain division. The degree of self-fertility varies however with parental forms; all hybrids between Triticum and A. intermedium are self-sterile, as are the hybrids between hard wheat and A.-elongatum, but a part of the hybrids between soft wheat and A. elongatum are self-fertile. The triple hybrids are relatively easily obtained by crossing F 1 to one of the parents. The data on the second generation concern chiefly the hybrids between wheat and A. intermedium, the majority of which were obtained by fusion of the male gametes with unreduced gametes of the F 1. Among sesquidiploids a forty-two chromosome plant was obtained, and among triple hybrids (F 1 X T. vulgare) forty-six and fifty-four chromosome plants were found; these plants resemble wheat, but they are perennial, Among F 2 plants (chiefly the triple hybrids) some lethal specimens with deficient chlorophyll were found. Both wheat sesquidiploids and those of couch grass are perennial and partly fertile. In reduction division of triple hybrids between T. dumm x 48 chromosome A. intermedium and A. vulgare, fourteen to twenty-one bivalents were counted and in the triple hybrid between T. durum X 48 chromosome A. intermedium and A. elongatum the number of bivalents was twenty-one. This suggests that the genomes A, B and D of wheats are homologous, though modified, with the respective Agropyron genomes. The Agropyron genomes X 1 and X 2 are not found in wheat; their relation to those of Aegilops has not yet been shown. The main trend of obtaining perennial wheat is thought to be through producing sesquidiploids which contain a haploid set of wheat and some Agropyron chromosomes. Fusion of these gametes will give plants with a diploid set of Triticum and Agropyron and a haploid set of Agropyron chromosomes; in these plants some of the Agropyron chromosomes will be univalents; selection of forms without univalents will give constant fertile forms. Triple hybrids might also give valuable forms, and finally obtaining amphidiploids by crossing wheat sesquidi-ploids with those of Agropyron should produce valuable forage plants.","1936","2015-06-03 04:46:00","2015-06-04 08:56:43","","25-30","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19370700935","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These plants had chromosome numbers of 2n = 42, 14 chromosomes having been obtained from Triticum, 21 from Agropyron and seven from Secale. Root-tip nuclei at interphase showed the chromocentric structure characteristic of Secale.

There was no apparent pairing between the chromosomes of Secale and those of the other two species; most of the chromosome associations arose from auto-syndesis of the Agropyron chromosomes. It was often possible to distinguish the Secale chromosomes amongst the univalents. Other aberrations typical of intergeneric hybrids were also observed.The hybrids were completely sterile even under conditions of open pollination.

Heavy depletion of winter sowings occurring yearly is the chief limiting factor in extension of the acreage sown with winter forms. With good management, the existing varieties will ensure a good crop; among agronomical measures, protection of sowings with snow is particularly important; it has been shown that under 50 cm. deep snow, temperatures at the depth of the tillering node do not fall below-2.4degreesC. when the surface temperature is about-22.6degreesC. Another important aspect is manuring which tends to increase carbohydrate content and thus the resistance of the plants, as well as regeneration of the parts damaged during winter. There is need for production of special Siberian varieties, in the breeding of which the vast resources in local peasant strains must be utilized; the method of training must also be used.

"XDQKIVAK","journalArticle","1948","Anonymous","Again about distant hybridization and the wheat- Agropyron hybrids.","Selektsiya i semenovodstvo","","","","","The minutes are published of a conference of the Scientific Council of the Institute of Grain Farming of the Non-Black-Earth Belt held on 8 March 1948. The meeting was held as a protest against an article on N. V. Cicin's work by G. Andreev (cf. Abst, 1518). The editorial commentary on the dispute lends its support to Andreev. The resolution, which is signed by 20 members of the Scientific Council, may be summarized as follows. (1) The article by G. Andreev should be declared as libellous and misleading. (2) Accusations of Cicin and his colleagues of an anti-Micurinite direction in biology is due to misrepresentation. (3) Hybridization between cultivated and wild plants at the Institute has given new forms and varieties during a shorter period of time than ordinary breeding methods would have done. (4) Cicin and his colleagues have obtained by distant hybrid-ization, for the first time in history, a perennial wheat and several useful annual spring and winter wheat- Agropyron hybrids. These have either been released commercially or are undergoing State commercial tests. (5) The first form of perennial wheat, No. 34085, was obtained by Cicin in. 1935. Commercial tests in Kazahstan and Kirgizia have shown that the wheat can yield 2-3 harvests in succession without resowing. At the Kirgiz State Breeding Station, for instance, during the two growth periods, 1942 and 1943, four harvests were collected totalling 55.2 c.per ha. The wheat was discarded because of certain uneconomic characters. It has been replaced by new perennial wheats lacking the disadvantages of the original form. Among the best of these is wheat No. 2, which has been bred in the Moscow province. (6) A spring wheat-Agropyron hybrid, variety Flora -5, and a winter variety No. 599 are undergoing state tests. The winter variety No. 599 is superior in yields to standard varieties of the Novgorod, Leningrad, Tula and Kaluga provinces. (7) The Agropyron-wheat varieties 22850 and 23021 have been highly productive in commercial fanning. The promising spring Agropyron-wheat varieties Flora 6 and 7 and the winter hybrid varieties Nos 186, 4871, 64/45 and the squarehead No. 1/P have been submitted for testing. (8) The winter hybrids No. 599 and E-2493 are resistant to lodging and smut and their grain has good baking properties. (9) In the course of developing distant hybridization, the institute has made advances in the problems of polyploids, in rapprochment by grafting of intergeneric and other plants, and in methods of artificial preservation of hybrid embryos resulting from difficult distant crosses. It discovered the presence of gluten in the grain of barley, rye and other cereals and the application of the fact to breeding cereals. (10) The research institute has obtained new wheat, rye and barley hybrids with Elymus, Agropyron-rye hybrids, and the trigeneric hybrids, wheat x Agropyron x Elymus, wheat x Agropyron x rye, and wheat x rye x Elymus. (11) Some shortcomings of the work at the institute, mostly of an administrative nature, are pointed out. The attention is drawn of the Minister of Agriculture of the USSR, I. A. Benediktov, to Andreev's article. This has nothing in common with Soviet self criticism, but instead runs down outstanding discoveries of Soviet breeding and misleads the Soviet public. The main points of the editorial criticisms of Cicin and his colleagues are lack of practical results during 20 years of activity, due to formalism, Morganism and metaphysical conceptions; the absence of a perennial wheat in commercial production; misinterpretation of Micurin to suit formalist theories; and the use of colchicine methods and other ""chance"" methods of orthodox geneticists.","1948","2015-06-03 04:44:50","2015-06-03 04:44:50","","63-72","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19491602253","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among traits involved in nitrogen conservation much attention has been drawn to resorption patterns. However, understanding of intra-population variability in resorption and nitrogen use efficiency is required prior to the development of new crops. Here we evaluate age-related changes in resorption patterns and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) within a wild population of Physaria mendocina (Brassicaceae). We generated a relative age index, based on morphological traits, and we use it as an independent variable to regress nitrogen concentrations in roots and leaves (green and senesced), nitrogen resorption efficiency and use efficiency. Nitrogen in green and senesced leaves decrease with age, resorption efficiency did not change, and nitrogen use efficiency increased. The lower nitrogen concentration in green leaves and higher proficiency (lower nitrogen concentrations in senesced leaves) of older plants might be due to a decrease in acquisition capacity. Constant efficiency is explained by the lack of differences in concentration in green and senesced leaves slopes. Higher proficiency in older plants resulted in higher NUE; this relationship would be modulated by nitrogen concentration in green leaves, which, in turn, is controlled by nitrogen availability and acquisition. These findings have implications in the domestication process, since in perennial species biomass production and internal plant nitrogen turnover over multiple seasons, are central key to physiological functions such as plant re-growth and winter survival. We identified a few questions as directions for future research.","March 2015","2015-06-03 02:26:43","2015-06-04 13:57:57","","227-232","","0","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","age class; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Brassicaceae; concentration (composition); Crops; dicotyledon; Domestication; Efficiency; Forestry; full text added; Intra-population variability; intrapopulation variation; Morphology; new record; nitrogen; Nitrogen concentrations; Nitrogen conservation; Nitrogen-use efficiency; NUE; Nutrient use efficiency; Ontogenetic changes; ontogeny; perennial plant; perennial W/1 grain; Physaria mendocina; Physiological functions; physiological response; Plants (botany); Proficiency; Regrowth; relevant; resorption; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; Senescence; SPV; time dependent behavior; wild population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While high-yielding perennial grass varieties are being developed in fertilized monocultures, breeding for yield in low-input high-diversity systems would be difficult. Before initiating breeding for low-input systems, it is therefore important to know the minimum number of functional groups and species required for maximum biomass harvest from low-input grasslands. We controlled the number of perennial grassland species in 168 plots in Minnesota, USA. Species were selected at random from a pool of 18, and 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 were planted in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured annually, and the plots were burned each spring. We found a strongly positive log-linear relationship between average annual aboveground biomass and planted species number, but a large proportion of plot-to-plot variability remained unexplained. We performed a conditional analysis of the aboveground biomass data to determine whether considering species identity would reduce the minimum number of species necessary in order to achieve yields similar to the highest diversity treatments. A model that accounted for the presence of legumes in general, and for the presence of the legume species Lupinus perennis in particular, showed no increase in biomass yield with increased species number. Over 11 years, average yields of L. perennis/C4 grass bicultures were similar to those of 16-species (maximum diversity) plots, and both were &gt;200% greater than the average of monocultures. Thus, under low-input conditions, the choice of the appropriate few perennial plant species for each location might result in systems with biomass yields similar to those from high-diversity systems. Because breeding biofuel crops in diverse mixtures would introduce complexity that is unwarranted in terms of maximum biomass yield, the first biofuel crop breeding programs for low-input systems are likely to accelerate progress by focusing on grass–legume bicultures.","April 15, 2010","2015-06-03 02:26:47","2015-06-04 13:57:48","","33-38","","1–2","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aboveground biomass; agricultural development; Agriculture; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Biofuel; Biomass; Crop production; Crop yield; full text added; Grassland; legume; Lupinus perennis; Minnesota; Perennial; perennial plant; perennial W/1 grain; Plant breeding; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; Species diversity; SPV; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perennial wheat produced 1.0 to 1.6 Mg ha-1 grain yield 50% of annual wheat (2.7 Mg ha-1) while perennial rye produced 1.3 Mg ha-1 73% of annual rye (1.8 Mg ha-1). Modest yields from perennials relative to annuals reflected lower harvest index lower yield per tiller and less kernel mass. One-year-old and 2-yr-old perennial plants had similar seed yields yield components and biomass production indicating that plant age had little effect on these parameters and older plants maintained yield potential. In contrast phenology did vary with plant age and showed a shift toward earlier spring growth and later flowering dates in older perennial plants. This illustrates an expanded vegetative period for regrowing plants of these perennial cereals. There appears to be potential for producing an early season forage crop from these cereals although biomass yields were not high at this site and regrowth was not always reliable. Overall performance of perennial rye was consistent with a viable new cereal crop. On the other hand perennial wheat requires further selection for allocation of biomass to grain and vigorous regrowth.","2012","2015-06-03 03:17:32","2015-06-03 06:46:26","","1716-1726","","6","104","","Agron.

With a longer growing season and larger allocation to root, perennials achieve better access to resources and are more resilient to stresses than annuals. In traditional agricultural systems selection for optimal soil nutrient uptake has been a secondary breeding objective, because crops receive subsidies of water and fertilizers. However in arid lands, caution is required during domestication, to avoid changes in structural traits which may be the basis for sustainable production. Due to inherent differences in hierarchy among annual and perennial species, we propose that the changes in phenology and allocation brought about by selection will depend on the life cycle. We performed field studies comparing wild and selected accessions of annual and perennial species of Physaria. Life cycle determined the functional basis of seed yield. In annuals, selection resulted in early anthesis (1 week earlier), a lower allocation to roots and leaves (twofold lower), and an increase in harvest index (an increase of 62%). Selected perennials had higher biomass at maturity (45% higher), linked to a longer reproductive period (3 weeks longer) than their wild relatives. The vegetative allocation found in wild perennials remained unchanged after selection. While annuals selected for seed yield could compromise the capacity for acquisition of resources, selection in perennials did not modify the allocation strategy responsible for their positive adjustment to low resource environments. We found a trade off between seed yield potential and yield stability that resulted in lower performance of selected accessions in low quality environments in relation to their wild relatives.","2012","2015-06-03 03:17:40","2015-06-03 20:42:16","","289-302","","2","186","","Euphytica","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Anthesis; Arid lands; Brassicaceae; Harvest index; Physaria (angiosperm); relevant; Root; Scopus; search.grain; Selection; SPV; Yield stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultivation of traditional hybrid crops in inherently hostile environments forces increased managerial and economic expenditures. Selection of ecologically harmonious crops exploits, rather than opposes natural forces. Based in part on US-AID funded research, we have identified three crops suitable for temperate/tropical cultivation. Amaranthus is recognized in Asia and Central and South America as a food crop that can be grown as a leafy vegetable or as a seed grain in mixed croppings. It does well under a wide variety of conditions using established cultural methods. It is nutritious and highly palatable and, in many areas, is well recognized in the market place. Prosopis species (mesquite) leguminous trees occur worldwide in arid and semi-arid areas. As phreatophytes, they are resistant to drought and high temperature extremes and produce abundant yields of edible beanlike pods. Using the beans from the tree, a variety of attractive, marketable food products have been prepared. We have also identified intermediate wheat-grass, a perennial relative of wheat, as an ecologically and economically attractive alternate crop. It is already a well-established range crop; grown for seed, it becomes a useful grain intercrop. The wholegrain or endosperm mill fractions make excellent tasting, appetizing and attractive baked products. Ongoing agronomic studies indicate it is especially suitable for balancing ecologically unstable areas.","May 1992","2015-06-03 02:28:29","2015-06-03 06:47:34","","265-274","","1–4","40","","Agric.

Dry matter yield has evolved as a breeding goal comparably important to the traditional grain yield. We analyzed the covariation between both traits and tested other agronomic traits for their correlation to dry matter yield that could be used for prediction of biomass yield. A set of 258 experimental hybrids were tested for dry matter yield harvested at late milk stage and grain yield harvested at full ripening at three to four locations in Germany in 2011 and 2012. We observed a wide range of dry matter yield (10-24 Mg ha-1) and grain yield (6-15 Mg ha-1) among testcross progenies. Genetic variances were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different from zero for all traits. High entry-mean heritabilities (0.92-0.94) were found for plant height measurements and moderate heritabilities for grain and dry matter yield (0.52 and 0.49, respectively). Relative efficiencies for selection of dry matter yield estimated by second (EC 51-55) and third (EC 73) measurements of plant height were 1.24 and 0.98 respectively, compared to 0.52 for grain yield. Indirect selection for high dry matter yield using late plant height measurements should be successful. Using grain yield for indirect selection was less effective. The observed broad genetic variation for biomass yield in elite hybrid rye gives good prospects for the use as a resource of renewable energy. Plant height is a good predictor of dry matter yield but should be selected together with improved lodging resistance.","2014","2015-06-03 05:57:21","2015-06-03 20:42:56","","424-429","","1","7","","Bioenergy Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (rye OR secale) AND NOT (""rye grass"" OR ""rye-grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Biogas production; Biomass; Correlation; Correlation methods; dry matter yield; Genes; Indirect selection; Lodging resistance; Relative efficiency; relevant; Renewable energies; Rye; Scopus; search.rye; Secale cereale; SPV; Substrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from rhizome tips of O. longistaminata were collected and analyzed. A total of 10,283 complimentary deoxyribunucleic acid clones were randomly sequenced, which generated 10,136 raw sequences, and finally, 4,419 unisequences with diverse functional categories were generated. These unisequences were mapped onto the Oryza sativa genome, which revealed that 4,285 (96.97%) and 4,151 (93.94%) of the unisequences were alignable to the japonica and indica genomic sequences, respectively, with > 80% sequence identity. Additionally, 41 unisequences showed four typical types of alternative splicing patterns. More than 600 simple sequence repeats were identified in these unisequences. A subset of unisequences were physically colocalized onto rhizome-related quantitative trait locus intervals in rice and sorghum, and one gene, OLRR1, was further confirmed to be enriched in the rhizome tip and young leaf by real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization.

This study explored photothermic resource use efficiency and predicted the highest theoretical yield of four crop types (maize, rice, ratoon rice and wheat) in the high-yielding regions of the Northeast plain, Huai Hai Lyrics valley and Yangtze River valley of China spanning a latitudinal range from N25.48° to N45.32°. The radiation production potential (RPP) and thermal production potential (TPP) of the four crop types were analyzed, using indexes of radiation production potential equivalence (RPPE) and thermal production potential equivalence (TPPE). The results showed that RPPE and TPPE varied with crop type, harvest zone and high-yielding areas. For the different crop types, the RPPE and TPPE of ratoon rice (0.7406, 0.7848) were the highest, while the RPPE of winter wheat (0.3041) and TPPE of rice (0.4955) were the lowest. The theoretical yield of maize (15,408.2 kg hm -2) was the highest while that of winter wheat (10,273.4 kg hm -2) was the lowest, and the theoretical yield of ratoon rice (12,245.2 kg hm -2) was higher than that of rice (11,117.7 kg hm -2). By harvest zone, the RPPE of the double harvest zone (0.5105) and TPPE of the single harvest zone (0.7015) were the highest, while the RPPE and TPPE of the triple harvest zone (0.4688, 0.5607) were the lowest. By area, the RPPE of Youxi (0.7406) and TPPE of Huadian (0.9089) were the highest, while the RPPE of Lianyungang (0.3607) and TPPE of Changsha (0.4702) were the lowest. Environmental parameters also impacted crop yield, where fewer hours of solar radiation caused a decline in RPP, while higher air temperatures increased TPP. Radiation was the limiting factor for summer maize, late rice and ratoon rice, while temperature was the limiting factor for winter wheat, spring maize and early rice; radiation was the limiting factor for the triple harvest zone, while temperature was the limiting factor for single and double harvest zones; finally, radiation was the limiting factor for Youxi, Changsha, Jiangsu, Wuxue and Haicheng, while temperature was the limiting factor for Harbin, Huadian, Laizhou, Xinxiang, Wuqiao and Lianyungang. Agricultural techniques also affected yield, where the optimum cultivation models were found to be high density double-planting for summer maize, cultivation in earth furrows for winter wheat, simultaneous optimization of the use of radiation and heat by ratoon rice and boosting of sink capacity and source capacity for rice. In conclusion, latitudinal differences in photothermic resources are poorly utilized, even in high-yielding regions, meaning that all regions including those that already meet their annual targets have the potential to further improve yields. Therefore, crops should be sown early to improve heat use efficiency in areas of low latitude while suitable sowing and harvesting dates should be chosen for high latitudes to improve radiation use efficiency. At the same time, the highest-yielding cultivation mode should be matched to the latitude, such as spring maize planting in Huadian, winter-wheat planting in Laizhou and ratoon rice planting in Youxi.","2012","2015-06-03 04:47:22","2015-08-31 15:59:24","","784-792","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20123189459","","","","Agriculture; ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); China; Crop; Photothermic resource use efficiency; Radiation production potential; Radiation production potential equivalence; relevant; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Thermal production potential; Thermal production potential equivalence; Triticum aestivum; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science; yield; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we performed a QTL analysis for yield and yield-component traits of an F2 population based on data from replicated field trials over 2 years using vegetative shoots of ratooned plants, making use of the ratooning habit of rice. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of conducting QTL analyses directly based on an F2 population by means of ratooning plants. The experimental population was from a cross between 'Zhenshan 97' and 'Minghui 63', the parents of 'Shanyou 63', an elite rice hybrid widely grown in China. A genetic linkage map containing 151 molecular markers was constructed for QTL mapping. A total of 20 distinct QTLs were detected; eight of these were detected in both years and remaining 12 in only 1 year. Compared with the results of our previous analysis of the F(2:3) families from the same cross, it was shown that most of the QTLs detected in the ratooned F2 population were also detected in the F(2:3) population. However, the estimates of both additive and dominant types of genetic effects for many of the QTLs based on F2 ratoons were substantially larger than those based on F(2:3) families. The results indicate that vegetatively ratooned F2 populations may have considerable utility in the mapping of QTLs, especially if dominant types of gene actions are of concern, although there were certain technical limitations in making use of such populations in the experiments.","2000","2015-06-03 04:11:14","2015-06-03 04:11:14","","248-254","","1-2","101","","Theor.

These cultivars were grown in pots and under light of natural day length with a suitable temperature regime. They were left uncut till 225 days after maturity, approximately one year after seeding. The number of new tillers appearing from maturity to 225 days after maturity was greatest in japonica and lowest in O. glabmima. The number of living tillers increased with time for a short while after maturity and then decreased, although in japonica, it increased again 120 days after maturity and thereafter. The survival duration of cultivars after maturity was clearly longer for O. sativa than for O. glaberrima. In japonica, all of the Japanese cultivars and all of the foreign cultivars except two survived longer than 225 days after maturity. In indica, most cultivars survived longer than 225 days after maturity, but several cultivars died in the early stage after maturity. In O. glaberrima, all the cultivars except one died before 225 days after maturity. From these results, it was concluded that O. sativa included both annual and perennial cultivars, whereas O. glaberrima was monocarpic annual. It was inferred that O. sativa inherited its genetical characteristics from O. rufipogon, which was thought to be the ancestor of O. sativa and included both annuals and perennials, and O. glaberrima inherited its characteristics from O. barthii, which was annual.","1999","2015-06-03 03:27:12","2015-06-03 03:27:12","","529-530","","4","68","","Jpn.

With respect to the 3 ratoon characteristics a significant decrease was observed to occur when the cutting time was delayed from 10 to 20 days after heading. The increase in the subsequent cutting was less marked. Analysis of variance suggests that ratoon weight, ratoon height and percentage of ratton tillers are heritable. In cuttings made 10 and 20 days after heading, there was a positive and highly significant phenotypic correlation between percentage of ripened grains of mother plant and these ratoon traits. Heritabilities in the broad sense for the ratoon traits became higher in the order, ratoon weight, ratoon height, percen-tage of ratoon tillers. Moreover, the heritability of percentage of ratoon tillers was nearly equal to that of culm length and panicle length.

The profitability that might be expected from perennial wheat of different types was investigated using MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System), a bioeconomic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. Although perennial wheat may produce a lower grain yield and quality than annual wheat, it is expected inputs of fertiliser, herbicide and sowing costs will be lower. Perennial wheat used solely for grain production was not selected as part of an optimal farm plan under the standard assumptions. In contrast, dual-purpose perennial wheat that produces grain and additional forage during summer and autumn than annual wheat can increase farm profitability substantially (AU$20/ha over the whole farm) and 20% of farm area was selected on the optimal farm plan under standard assumptions. Forage from perennial wheat replaced stubble over summer and grain supplement at the break of season and increased farm stock numbers. The additional value added by grazing also reduced the relative yield required for perennial wheat to be profitable. This analysis suggests perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers.","March 2008","2015-06-03 02:26:37","2015-06-03 06:53:31","","166-174","","1–3","96","","Agric.

In various countries, farmers have been encouraged through incentives to cultivate SRC. Nevertheless, they often do not switch from conventional land use to SRC, even if SRC is relatively beneficial according to the net present value (NPV) rule. Therefore, farmers do not follow the classical investment theory. A relatively new theory is the real options approach (ROA). The ROA takes further aspects like irreversibility of the investment costs, flexibility regarding investment timing, and uncertainty of the investment returns into account, which the NPV rule ignores. In the case of SRC, investment (conversion) triggers when a farmer should switch to SRC following the ROA can be higher than those following the NPV rule. As it is often the case in real options applications, decision makers’ possibility to disinvest in general and farmers’ possibility to reconvert, in particular within the useful lifetime of SRC, is not considered. We build a model to calculate the conversion triggers for switching from annual crop production to SRC following the ROA. We consider the opportunity to reconvert the land and evaluate the respective effects on the conversion triggers according to the ROA. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of a former governmental incentive, in terms of an investment subsidy, on the conversion triggers of both theories. Our calculations show that following the ROA, a farmer should change land use to SRC more slowly than when following the NPV rule. Furthermore, neglecting the reconversion possibility would cause considerable bias amongst the results. The consideration of investment subsidies diminishes the conversion triggers of both theories. We conclude that the ROA can at least partially explain farmers’ inertia of converting to SRC.","May 2014","2015-06-03 05:27:38","2015-06-04 09:20:38","","163-174","","0","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Genetic algorithms; Investment subsidy; Land conversion; Net present value; perennial W/1 (rye OR secale) AND NOT (""rye grass"" OR ""rye-grass"" OR ryegrass); Real options approach; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.rye; Short rotation coppice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to determine the chromosomal basis of this phenomenon, life-history characteristics were examined using Chinese Spring wheat and a complete Thinopyrum elongatum (2n=2x=14) chromosome addition series in a Chinese Spring background. Both monosomic and disomic additions and substitutions of Th. elongatum chromosome 4E conferred a polycarpic life history to annual Chinese Spring wheat. Disomic addition lines were found to be perennial under field conditions. This is the first report of a single alien chromosome conferring a polycarpic growth habit to a monocarpic species. Chromosome 4E altered the timing of tiller initiation, such that two growth phases could be clearly identified, the first phase being indistinguishable from the growth of euploid Chinese Spring, followed by a second phase of tiller initiation after the sexual cycle of the first phase tillers was complete (post-sexual cycle regrowth).","2004","2015-06-03 03:19:24","2015-06-03 06:53:46","","1715-1720","","403","55","","J.

Red rice (Oryza longistaminata) is a perennial wild rice species with many valuable traits that could be used to improve cultivated rice cultivars, including rhizomatousness, disease resistance and drought tolerance. Despite these features, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhizome growth, development and function in this plant. Results: We used an integrated approach to compare the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the rhizome to other tissues of red rice. 116 Gb of transcriptome sequence was obtained from various tissues and used to identify rhizome-specific and preferentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches identified 41 proteins and more than 100 primary metabolites and plant hormones with rhizome preferential accumulation. Of particular interest was the identification of a large number of gene transcripts from Magnaportha oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast disease in cultivated rice, even though the red rice plants showed no sign of disease. Conclusions: A significant set of genes, proteins and metabolites appear to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the rhizome of O. longistaminata. The presence of M. oryzae gene transcripts at a high level in apparently healthy plants suggests that red rice is resistant to this pathogen, and may be able to provide genes to cultivated rice that will enable resistance to rice blast disease.","FEB 12  2014","2015-06-03 04:22:42","2015-06-04 09:27:24","","46","","","14","","BMC Plant Biol.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","WOS:000335059200001","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); article; disease resistance; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genetics; Invasive species; metabolism; Metabolomics; Oryza sativa; Physiology; Proteomics; relevant; Rhizome; Rice; Rice blast; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; SPV; Transcriptome; Transcriptomics; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild relatives of crop plants are a source of useful variation which is of immense value for crop improvement. Australian wild rices have been isolated from the impacts of domestication in Asia and represents a source of novel diversity for global rice improvement. Oryza rufipogon is a perennial wild progenitor of cultivated rice. Oryza meridionalis is a related annual species in Australia. Results: We have examined the sequence of the genomes of AA genome wild rices from Australia that are close relatives of cultivated rice through whole genome re-sequencing. Assembly of the resequencing data to the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare shows that Australian wild rices possess 2.5 times more single nucleotide polymorphisms than in the Asian wild rice and cultivated O. sativa ssp. indica. Analysis of the genome of domesticated rice reveals regions of low diversity that show very little variation (polymorphism deserts). Both the perennial and annual wild rice from Australia show a high degree of conservation of sequence with that found in cultivated rice in the same 4.58Mbp region on chromosome 5, which suggests that some of the 'polymorphism deserts' in this and other parts of the rice genome may have originated prior to domestication due to natural selection. Conclusions: Analysis of genes in the 'polymorphism deserts' indicates that this selection may have been due to biotic or abiotic stress in the environment of early rice relatives. Despite having closely related sequences in these genome regions, the Australian wild populations represent an invaluable source of diversity supporting rice food security.","2014","2015-06-03 03:25:20","2015-06-04 09:27:45","","","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); article; Australia; chromosome 5; cultivated species; domesticated plant; natural selection; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Oryza meridionalis; Oryza rufipogon; perennial plant; plant chromosome; plant genome; relevant; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; SPV; wild plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These advantages are particularly relevant for emerging biomass crops and it is projected that perennial grasses will be among the most important dedicated biomass crops. The advantages offered by perennial crops could also prove favorable for incorporation into annual grain crops like wheat, rice, sorghum and barley, especially under the dryer and more variable climate conditions projected for many grain-producing regions. Thus, it would be useful to have a perennial model system to test biotechnological approaches to crop improvement and for fundamental research. The perennial grass Brachypodium sylvaticum is a candidate for such a model because it is diploid, has a small genome, is self-fertile, has a modest stature, and short generation time. Its close relationship to the annual model Brachypodium distachyon will facilitate comparative studies and allow researchers to leverage the resources developed for B. distachyon. Here we report on the development of two keystone resources that are essential for a model plant: high-efficiency transformation and inbred lines.

In the wild, tuber dormancy is broken after exposure to winter cold, resulting in sprouting and shoot development in the spring when conditions are favorable. The dormancy period typically limits H. tuberosus populations to one growth cycle per year. An efficient method for breaking tuber dormancy is needed to have an additional growth cycle per year in a breeding program, which could take place in winter in the nursery or the greenhouse allowing for increased breeding efficiency. The objective of this research was to compare chemical and cold temperature treatments for artificially breaking tuber dormancy in 12 genotypes of H. tuberosus and interspecific hybrids of Helianthus annuus L. × H. tuberosus. Five cold exposures (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 weeks at 2°C), three plant hormones (ethylene, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid), and one untreated control were examined. Gibberellic acid was the best chemical treatment, initiating plant growth within 6.5 to 11.5 days in the majority of genotypes tested. The best cold treatment was exposure to 2°C for 8 weeks, where plant growth began 63.6 to 67.5 days after treatment initiation. Although longer cold treatments shortened the time to emergence while in the greenhouse, the penalty of the long cold treatment per se was too long to be useful. The gibberellic acid treatment strategy described here may not need further optimization, because it is short enough to allow for two growth cycles of H. tuberosus per year.","2012","2015-06-03 03:17:35","2015-06-04 09:30:48","","1342-1346","","9","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Cold treatment; Cytokinin; Ethylene; Gibberellic acid; Helianthus annuus; Helianthus tuberosus; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the breeding ecology of the two species in San Jose, Mindoro, Philippines, for four rice cropping seasons (two dry and two wet) over two years, 2009–2010, as a basis to develop effective management. We found to our surprise that their breeding ecology was similar. For both species (i) the onset of the breeding season was at the tillering stage of the rice crop; (ii) conception of adult females was highest at booting and ripening of rice; (iii) the highest litter size occurred at the ripening and stubble stages, and the lowest at tillering. Based on their breeding ecology we recommend that the most effective strategy to reduce damage to rice crops is to prevent the development of high populations of both species of rice field rats. This goal requires coordinated community control at both the sowing/planting time and maximum tillering of rice, in combination with the synchronous planting of rice to limit the length of the main breeding season.","October 15, 2012","2015-06-03 03:07:21","2015-06-03 07:08:28","","39-45","","0","161","","Agric.

Oryza longistaminata is an undomesticated, perennial, rhizomatous relative of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Using five sets of 4 × 2 factorial mating designs, we crossed rhizomatous interspecific genotypes (IGs) from an intermated O. sativa/O. longistaminata population with male-fertile IG selections from the intermated population, and with O. sativa CVs. Parents and progeny were planted in an upland field at IRRI using a randomized complete block design and evaluated for rhizome expression, survival after 1 year, vigor of the survivors, and yield. For the IG parents, rhizome expression was variable and penetrance of most genotypes was incomplete, but genotypes that demonstrated the potential for moderate rhizome expression had high penetrance (89% average). The CV parents yielded 11.0 g/plant on average but none produced rhizomes or survived 1 year. The IG parents averaged yields of 3.1 g/plant, 57% rhizomatous and 36% survival. The IG/IG progeny averaged yields of 4.2 g/plant, 32% rhizomatous and 37% survival. The IG/CV progeny averaged yields of 6.0 g/plant, 18% rhizomatous and 16% survival. Nine IG/IG progeny and six IG/CV progeny were rhizomatous, perennial, and yielded at least 5 g/plant, and five of these yielded more than 10 g/plant. For the IG parents and IG/IG progeny, rhizome presence and expression were positively associated with survival and vigor of the survivors. General combining ability effects were significant for percent survival and yield but not percent rhizomatous. Specific combining ability effects were significant for percent rhizomatous, percent survival and yield. By selecting female parents for long rhizomes and male parents for fertility, considerable gains in rhizome expression, survival and yield were made. The development of perennial upland rice CVs should be feasible via introgression of genes from O. longistaminata.","January 8, 2006","2015-06-03 02:43:03","2015-06-03 07:08:56","","39-48","","1","95","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Asia; Clonal performance; Crops; Eastern Hemisphere; Erosion; Eurasia; Fertility; Fertilizers; full text added; Growth; Interspecific crosses; Oryza; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Plant breeding; Proteins; relevant; Rhizome; Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; Soil erosion; soils; Southeast Asia; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Varieties; Web of Science; World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GHVSIIA6","journalArticle","1934","PRUTSKOVA, M. G.","Breeding grain crops.","Bull. Appl. Bot. Leningrad, Ser. A","","","","","The most notable achievement of the Soviet grain breeders is the distribution of 59 improved varieties of the main grain crops, winter and spring wheat, barley, oats and rye, suitable for cultivation in all the main regions of the Soviet Union. These 59 represent the best varieties chosen in variety tests involving 500-600 varieties, and some of them have been the means of extending the cultivation of the crop in question into new areas, for instance wheat growing has been pushed farther north by the production of the ultra-early spring wheat Novinka, also possessed of excellent grain qualities, and of various new hardy winter wheats, including rye-wheat hybrid 46/131. The same is true in the case of barley and oats. One of the new early oats is also highly resistant to drought and to rust. Cultivation in the arid zones has been made possible by the creation of new drought-resistant varieties of wheat and barley at the same time distinguished by improved quality and greater earliness. Still further improvement in these varieties is desired nevertheless in respect of yield, and in some cases also quality or cold-resistance, and in nearly every case in respect of disease resistance. Various hybrids and selections distinguished by improved disease resistance are quoted, special interest being attached to hybrids of Avena sativa x A. byzantina, which in 1933 exceeded the standard in yield by four times and are much more resistant to leaf rust; certain American and Canadian wheat hybrids are also very promising. For purposes of mechanized harvesting, great importance is directed to non-shedding and non-lodging strains and mention is made of a number of varieties favourable in this respect, and of others that a, re promising in all respects but this. For instance, a new rye produced at Detskoje Selo by crossing the local rye with Rumker is free from both lodging and shedding whilst exceeding the standard variety Vyatka considerably in yield. A table is given in which the origin of all the most promising new varieties is shewn, i.e. the material from which they were produced and the methods used, whether selection or hybridization, etc. From this it is clear that the local varieties have contributed most to the formation of the new improved material, since they are the ones preeminently possessed of the desired characters, such as drought and cold resistance, earliness, yield, etc. Many of these local varieties were introduced years ago from abroad and often represented partly impure populations of some successful cultivated variety, since which time they have been subjected to a process of natural selection for tolerance of the unfavourable conditions of the particular region in which they are grown. An emphatic plea is made for the preservation and further study of these local varieties and for an extension of the work of hybridizing them with varieties from other countries, specially those countries known to be characterized by varieties possessed of certain special characters, such as earliness in the wheats of the near East, etc. etc. The practical possibilities of distant hybridization are also emphasized and reference is made to the production of hybrids possessed of a non-shedding habit, drought-resistance, good milling and baking quality and satisfactory yield from crosses of hard and soft wheats at Saratov, valuable rust-resistant oats from Avena sativa x A. byzantina and disease resistant wheats from crosses of T. durum with T. dicoccum; and finally to the new genus Secalotriticum produced from crosses of wheat and rye, together with a number of other useful hybrids from the same cross, one of which is already being grown on quite a large scale. In 1930 successful crosses were made of spring wheat with Agropyrum intermedium and more recently with A. elongatum, from which it is hoped to obtain perennial wheats and so present an entirely new solution to the problems of drought and cold resistance. A plea is also made for an attempt to accelerate the speed of breeding work by application of vernalization and other measures and to reduce the period required to produce a new variety, if possible, to 5 years.","1934","2015-06-03 04:46:04","2015-06-03 04:46:04","","93-103","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600067","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The persistent problem of worldwide soil erosion has rekindled interest in perennial grain crops. All of our current grain crops are annuals; therefore, developing an array of new perennial grains - grasses, legumes, and others - will require a long-term commitment. Fortunately, many perennial species can be hybridized with related annual crops, allowing us to incorporate genes of domestication much more quickly than did our ancestors who first selected the genes. Some grain crops - including rye, rice, and sorghum - can be hybridized with close perennial relatives to establish new gene pools. Others, such as wheat, oat, maize, soybean, and sunflower, must be hybridized with more distantly related perennial species and genera. Finally, some perennial species with relatively high grain yields - intermediate wheatgrass, wildrye, lymegrass, eastern gamagrass, Indian ricegrass, Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, and probably others - are candidates for direct domestication without interspecific hybridization. To ensure diversity in the field and foster further genetic improvement, breeders will need to develop deep gene pools for each crop. Discussions of breeding strategies for perennial grains have concentrated on allocation of photosynthetic resources between seeds and vegetative structures. However, perennials will likely be grown in more diverse agro-ecosystems and require arrays of traits very different from those usually addressed by breeders of annuals. The only way to address concerns about the feasibility of perennial grains is to carry out breeding programs with adequate resources on a sufficient time scale. A massive program for breeding perennial grains could be funded by diversion of a relatively small fraction of the world's agricultural research budget.","2002","2015-06-03 04:20:44","2015-06-03 04:20:44","","59-91","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000174854200001","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.","Breeding perennial varieties of wheat and other plants.","Selektsiya i semenovodstvo","","","","","Since 1930 work on the production of perennial forms of barley, wheat and rye has been in progress. The three methods used for wheat are hybridization of wheat with perennial rye and with Agropyrum and the selection of perennial wheats from wild and cultivated forms. The most promising of the wheat-rye crosses have been Leucurum 1364/1 x S. montanum and Stepnjacka x S. montanum and from the first-named combination a fertile perennial hard wheat was obtained comprising lines with 49-39 grains to the ear and a thousand corn weight of from 43.7 to 44.2 grm. These yields were obtained from vernalized seed without irrigation or manuring. Normally developed hybrids of increased yielding capacity proved resistant to brown rust and drought. Their winter-hardiness has still to be fully tested. Their main defect is brittleness of the ear but it is hoped that in the course of segregation forms without brittle ears may be obtained as has already been done by hybridization with non-shattering forms. Crosses are also contemplated between wheat and perennial rye with a rough rachis experimentally obtained by crosses of cultivated and wild perennial rye. So far only a few F 1 combinations from wheat crossed by Agropyrum are available but an F 2consisting of 100 plants has been raised from Agropyrum elongatum x Melanopus 0122. Comparing the perennial wheat x rye and wheat x Agropyrum hybrids the latter are seen to have a great advantage in their resistance to fungus diseases. On the other hand their yield is very low. The likelihood of the existence of undiscovered wild perennial wheats, particularly among the wild wheats of Armenia, is mentioned. Among the advantages cited which the perennial forms of various crops such as cereals, flax and sunflower have over the annual forms is high yielding capacity in successive years which ensures a second crop of hay and in the case of some spring forms, even a second crop of grain. The different developmental stages shewn by various groups of plants and their relation to tillering capacity are discussed. Suggestions for meeting various difficulties that arise in the cultivation of perennial forms and a statement of future aims in the production of perennial wheat conclude the paper.","1936","2015-06-03 04:39:39","2015-06-03 07:09:00","","20-24","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19371600946","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is thought to be due to the habits of the plants which in the first year utilize a considerable amount of plastic material for building up the roots; in subsequent years the perennials live mainly on the roots previously formed and use the nutrients deposited in the autumn. Perennials are more resistant and adaptable to environment, and therefore the vegetation of deserts, highlands and extreme northerly regions is mainly represented by perennials. Almost all known plants have their own perennial forms, but a number of defects prevent their direct use in practice. These defects could be eliminated, however, in hybridization with the annual cultivated forms or with some other species, as in the case of wheat. Crossing Vicia cracca with cultivated annual forms eliminates the defects of perennial vetch. Among perennial Lathyrus latifolius valuable forms have been selected. Crossing perennial sorghum and its hybrids with annual forms results in plants with a high drought resistance. See also Derzavin, Herb.

The Broadbalk plots feature annual wheat and have been in continuous production since 1843, while the Park Grass plots feature perennial grassland vegetation that has been hayed every year since 1856. To evaluate the long-term effects of annual versus perennial vegetation on soil P forms, we carried out Hedley P fractionations and microbial biomass-P fumigation-extraction analyses on soils from fertilized and unfertilized treatments of both experiments. In both P-fertilized and unfertilized soils we found an inverse relationship between pool sizes of actively cycling Po (0.5 M bicarbonate + 0.1 M NaOH fractions) and recalcitrant Pi (hot conc. HCl + final digest fractions) with Po dominant in the perennial hay meadow and recalcitrant Pi dominant in the annual wheat. Microbial biomass-P in the surface horizons of fertilized and unfertilized perennial hay meadow was an order of magnitude greater than in annual wheat. To investigate how P fractions changed through time we conducted Hedley P fractionations on archived soils sampled from Broadbalk wheat in 1893, and Park Grass hay meadow in 1876. Since 1893, unfertilized Broadbalk soils experienced almost no change in P fractions in the surface 23 cm, but substantial depletion in labile and recalcitrant Pi and Po in deeper strata. The Park Grass perennial vegetation showed greater depletion of surface soil fractions over time. When fertilized for over 100 years, almost all P fractions in the surface 23 cm were enriched in both crop types, but below 70 cm, only the active Po pool in Park Grass showed a substantial increase under fertilization. Even when fertilized, low available or occluded Pi fractions in both annual and perennial systems were substantially depleted below 70 cm. Our findings suggest that herbaceous perennials maintain a greater proportion of native or fertilizer-P in relatively available organic forms compared to annual wheat.

While nearly three-quarters of the genes are expressed at a constant level in all six lineages, a large portion of the genome, ranging from 1767 to 4489 genes, exhibited differential expression between Asian domesticated and wild rice with repression or down-regulation of genome expression in Asian cultivated rice as the dominant trend.

Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that genes related to catabolism are repressed while genes related to anabolism up-regulated.

Screening biodiversity for useful or diverse gene homologues has often been based upon the amplification of targeted genes using available sequence information to design primers that amplify the target gene region across species. The crucial requirement of this approach is the presence of sequences with sufficient conservation across species to allow for the design of universal primers. This approach is often not successful with diverse organisms or highly variable genes. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) can quickly produce large amounts of sequence data and provides a viable option for characterizing homologues of known genes in poorly described genomes. MPS of genomic DNA was used to obtain species-specific sequence information for 18 rice genes related to domestication characteristics in a wild relative of rice, Microlaena stipoides. Species-specific primers were available for 16 genes compared with 12 genes using the universal primer method. The use of species-specific primers had the potential to cover 92% of the sequence of these genes, while traditional universal primers could only be designed to cover 80%. A total of 24 species-specific primer pairs were used to amplify gene homologues, and 11 primer pairs were successful in capturing six gene homologues. The 23million, 36-base pair (bp) paired end reads, equated to an average of 2X genome coverage, facilitated the successful amplification and sequencing of six target gene homologues, illustrating an important approach to the discovery of useful genes in wild crop relatives.","2011","2015-06-03 03:17:55","2015-06-03 20:48:51","","1131-1140","","9","9","","Plant Biotechnol.

In low-input and organic systems, there is greater reliance on complex rotations including annual and perennial crops, organic N sources, and internal N cycling that more closely mimic natural systems. These differences in farming system practices fundamentally affect N availability and N use efficiency (NUE) and could impact crop traits and breeding strategies required to optimize NUE. We assess genetic and environmental factors that could assist breeders in improving crop performance in low-input and organic farming systems by examining NUE in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Crop plants have often been bred for high N productivity, while plants adapted to low N ecosystems often have lower productivity and higher levels of internal N conservation. Breeders can potentially combine N productivity and N conservation through the use of elite and wild germplasm. Beneficial genetic traits include the ability to maintain photosynthesis and N uptake under N stress and the ability to extract soil N at low concentrations, perhaps through beneficial associations with soil microorganisms. In addition, breeding for specific adaptation to climactic and management practices so that crop uptake patterns match N availability patterns, while minimizing pathways of N loss, will be critical to improving NUE.","May 10, 2008","2015-06-03 02:27:35","2015-06-04 13:54:12","","89-101","","2","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cereal crops; full text added; Nutrient cycling; Perennial crops; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); relevant; ScienceDirect; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since current wheat cultivars lack certain traits, for example, resistance to fusarium head blight (scab), related wild grasses may be the only option for useful variability. Wide hybridization of wheat with grasses, coupled with cytogenetic manipulation of the hybrid material, has been instrumental in the genetic improvement of wheat. Chromosome engineering methodologies, based on the manipulation of pairing control mechanisms and induced translocations, have been employed to transfer into wheat specific disease and pest resistance genes from annual (e.g., rye) or perennial (e.g., Thinopyrum spp., Lophopyrum spp., and Agropyron spp.) members of the wheat tribe, Triticeae. The advent of in situ hybridization techniques, for example, fluorescent GISH combined with Giemsa C-banding, has proved immensely useful in characterizing alien chromatin specifying resistance to various pathogens and pests. The use of DNA markers (RAPDs and RFLPs) helps to identify desirable genotypes more precisely and, thereby, facilitates gene transfer into wheat. Such markers may be particularly helpful in monitoring the introgression of alien genes in the wheat genome. In fact, several cultivars, particularly of bread wheat, contain superior traits of alien origin. The development of novel gene-transfer techniques in the past decade that allow direct delivery of DNA into regenerable embryogenic callus of wheat has opened up new avenues of alien-gene transfer into wheat cultivars. Thus, transgenic bread and durum wheats have been produced and methods of gene delivery standardized. The application of transgenic technology has not only yielded herbicide-resistant wheats, but has also helped to improve grain quality by modifying the protein and starch profiles of the grain. These in vitro approaches to gene transfer are developing rapidly, and promise to become an integral part of plant breeding efforts. However, the new biotechnological tools will complement, not replace, conventional plant breeding.","August 1999","2015-06-03 05:32:48","2015-06-04 09:38:57","","570-583","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND22034766&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; perennial N1 (rye OR secale) NOT (""rye grass"" OR ryegrass OR ""rye-grass""); relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","chromosomes; cultivars; cytogenetics; disease resistance; genetic engineering; genetic improvement; genetic markers; genetic resistance; gene transfer; genotype; interspecific hybridization; introgression; literature reviews; monitoring; nucleic acid hybridization; pest resistance; plant breeding; plant genetic resources; random amplified polymorphic DNA technique; restriction fragment length polymorphism; transgenic plants; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; wide hybridization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If perennial cultivars of upland rice were developed, they would provide farmers with an inexpensive tool to produce a preferred food while conserving soil. O. rufipogon, the undomesticated progenitor of O.sativa, includes perennial and stoloniferous forms. To evaluate the feasibility of developing perennial cultivars by combining genes of O.sativa and O.rufipogon, four trials were conducted in an upland field at IRRI:O. sativalO. rufipogon F-1 clone and cutting height trial, F-2 family trial, and two O.scitiva/stoloniferous-selection factorial mating design trials. Plants were established at the beginning of the rainy season, then subjected to a 6-month dry season and evaluated for survival after 1 year. Of the 2101 cultivar control plants, only three IR47686-1-4-B individuals survived and none produced stolons. The 18 F, clones, which were selected from previous trials with less drought stress, ranged in survival from 4.4 to 91.4%. Cutting height at harvest did not affect survival. Survival among the F,, families ranged from 9.4 to 31.9%. Segregation for stolon presence did not differ from a 3:1 ratio for five of the six F2 families, suggesting the effect of a single dominant gene. Average yields per plant for the F2 families were 1/3 to 1/9 of yields for the cultivars. However, by crossing the F(1)s to cultivars, yield potential was almost fully recovered. For the full-sib families of the factorial trials, survival ranged from 0.0 to 48.6%. Azucena and IR47686-1-4-B, both japonica cultivars, exhibited greater general combining ability for survival relative to the six other cultivar parents. Thus, the process of developing perennial cultivars of rice should include screening annual cultivars to identify those with the best combining ability for survival. To develop cultivars of perennial upland rice, drought avoidance and/or tolerance from annual upland cultivars must be combined with the capacity for perennial growth from wild perennial species. The frequency of stolonifereous testcross progeny was lower than expected and was affected by the 0. sativa parent. Thus, additional genes likely affected stolon penetrance and expression. Analyses of covariance indicated that stolons improved the likelihood of survival for progenies of the factorial trials but the effect was small (b < 0.1), and that yield (g/plant) had a small negative effect on percent survival (b = -0.13 to -0.32). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introgress genes for perennial growth from wild 0. rufipogon accessions into domesticated 0. sativa.

This transition can occur once, in annual species, or repeatedly, in perennial plants. In annuals, flowering is associated with senescence and death of the whole plant, whereas perennials flower in consecutive years and maintain vegetative development after flowering. The perennial life strategy depends on differential behavior of meristems on a single plant so that some remain in the vegetative state while others undergo the floral transition. A. thaliana provides a powerful model system for understanding the mechanisms of flowering in annuals. Here we review the events that occur in the meristem of A. thaliana during the floral transition and compare these with our understanding of flowering in perennial systems.","2010","2015-06-03 03:26:08","2015-06-03 20:31:23","","","323","","91","","","","Current Topics in Developmental Biology","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); AP1 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis protein; Arabidopsis Proteins; article; Biological Evolution; biological model; comparative study; Evolution; flower; Flowers; gene expression regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; growth, development and aging; LFY protein, Arabidopsis; MADS domain protein; MADS Domain Proteins; meristem; metabolism; Models, Biological; periodicity; Physiology; relevant; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Transcription factor; Transcription Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on farming systems research comparing organic and conventional agroecosystems. The types of farming systems comparison studies, some of the metrics used, and integrative research approaches to farming systems studies are discussed. To hasten implementation of more sustainable agricultural systems, more farming systems comparison research, especially interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary, is needed, which brings together multiple disciplines and, when possible, non-academic participants to measure key sustainability indicators and/or ecosystem services. Such research does not just need to compare organic and conventional systems. In addition to organic farming systems, other innovative systems make up a modest, but growing, component of US and global agriculture and include alternative livestock production (e.g., grass-fed), mixed crop/livestock systems, conservation agriculture, integrated farming, agroforestry, and perennial grains. Such systems integrate production, environmental, and socioeconomic objectives and reflect greater awareness of ecosystem services. These systems can be studied in farming systems research, in which they are compared with each other or with conventional systems.","2013","2015-06-03 04:20:09","2015-06-03 04:20:09","","CM-2013-0429-01-RS","","April","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20133215263","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these two species, the former is believed to derive from a perennial wild rice (O. perennis) and the latter has an annual wild rice (O. breviligulata) as an ancestor. In order to know how closely the growth characteristics, perenniality or annuality, of each ancestor has been inherited to the present cultivar, we investigated inter-specific difference in ratooning ability after culm cutting treatments at the post heading stage. The growth vigor of ratoons was used as an indicator for the strength of vegetative growth continuity or growth perenniality here. Two cultivar lines, S173 (O. sativa) and G174 (O. glaberrima), were used as experimental materials. Seeds of these two lines were collected in the closely neighboring areas by the Niger River in West Africa, and their growth was tested at the experimental field of Kyushu University, Japan. The results obtained are as follows; 1) These two cultivars represented a vigorous growth to reach the harvest stage. The dry matter weight in leaves and culms decreased by export of the photosynthate from these parts to panicles in S173, whereas such a phenomenon was not detected in G174; the panicle weight increased with increase in weight of the non yield part of a plant. 2) The ratoon emergence ratios (No. of ratoons/No. of mother plant culms) at the early to late stages after heading were higher in S173 than in G174. 3) In the stock (the plant part below 10 cm height from the soil surface), a little more increased weight was detected in S173 and the content of total non structural carbohydrate (TNC) was several-fold higher in S173 compared to that of G174.

In the tribe Triticeae, several genera contain both annual and perennial species, whereas other genera comprise strictly annual or perennial species. It was suggested that Triticeae annuals have originated from Triticeae perennials. The present study aims to analyze nucleotide diversity of Acc-1 gene among different Triticeae genomes, and attempts to link effects of life history (annuals and perennials) and mating systems. The nucleotide diversity of 364 Acc-1 sequences in Triticeae species was characterized. The highest estimates of nucleotide diversity values (π = 0.01919, θ = 0.03515) were found for the Ns genome among the genomes analyzed. Nucleotide diversities in the D genome and Ns genome of polyploids are higher than those in respective genomes of diploids, while in the St genome of polyploids, it is lower than that in the St genome of diploids. The averaged π value (0.013705) in the genomes of perennials is more than twice of the value (0.00508) in the genomes of annuals. The averaged π value (0.01323) in the genomes of outcrossing species is two-fold of the value (0.005664) in the genomes of selfer.

The results show that after high temperature stress, the anther dehiscence coefficient and stainable pollen grain percentage of main crop rice of ' No. 1 of Y liangyou ' and ' Liangyoupeijiu' decrease significantly (P 0. 05) . The setting rate decreases 6. 07% and 54. 48% , and the 1 000-grain weight falls 9. 03% and 9. 98% , respectively, and ' Liangyoupeijiu' has a bigger decline of each index than ' No. 1 of Y liangyou'.

The current study revealed that C. partellus is expanding its distribution into the high elevations of the eastern Highveld region of South Africa. The only stem borer already found there (elevation 1,600 m) is Busseola fusca (Fuller). After C. partellux invaded the region, it rapidly increased its share of the total borer population every year. On maize, the region, it rapidly increased its share of the total borer population every year. On 7 yr. The most rapid population increase by C. partellus occurred on the ratoon grain sorghum crop. Within 2 yr it became the predominant borer. constituting ∼90% of the total stem borer population. C. partellus has proven to be an efficient colonizer, and it seems to be displacing the indigenous B. fusca. C. partellus survives the dry winters (at subzero temperatures) of the Highveld region in South Africa by diapausing low in the dry stalks, often beneath the soil. Hibernating larval populations of C. partellus terminate diapause and emerge as moths ∼1 mo earlier than B. fusca. This enables C. partellus to infest the grain sorghum ratoon crop before B. fusca, thus becoming the predominant borer in this niche. The life cycle of C. partellus is 3 wk shorter than that of B. fusca, which gives it a further competitive advantage because of its higher potential rate of increase.","1997","2015-06-03 04:12:47","2015-06-03 07:19:40","","619-624","","5","90","","Ann.

A study was conducted for the investigation of the persistence, the dry matter accumulation potential and the competitive ability of perennial grain crops in different mixtures on marginal lands. Factorial field experiments were conducted at two sites with marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum Guss.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium Host.), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.) and linseed (Linum perenne L.). In some stands white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved nitrogen supply. Intermediate wheatgrass and lupine demonstrated the best persistence among the examined species. Rye showed a satisfactory ability to persist only when grown in mixture with legumes. Apparently the persistence of rye was influenced positively from nitrogen fixed by the legumes. Linseed showed only on one location a small ability for perennialism, while on the other location it did not persist at all. Both grass species were in most cases stronger competitors than the companion species. In various mixtures a positive effect of legumes on the growth of the grass species was evident. Therefore even using grain crop mixtures of grasses and legumes seem to be promising for marginal lands. Since species' competitive ability depends to a large extent on the site, statements about the suitability of different species for growing together in mixtures are not generally possible, but only with reference to a specific site.","2002","2015-06-03 03:19:40","2015-06-03 07:20:05","","107-114","","3-4","76","","J.

From 1986 to 1992 I monitored seasonal net aboveground production and species composition at four sites with soils that differed in texture and percent organic matter, pH, and concentrations of NH4, total N, K, Ca, Mg, and SO4. Four years of the survey featured above normal precipitation and 3 were drought years. August standing crop averaged 566 +/- 307, 419 +/- 143, 268 +/- 158, and 232 +/- 148 g . m(-2) at the four sites. Production generally increased with soil fertility (i.e., percent organic matter, total N, and K) and precipitation. The two more productive sites featured higher percentages of grass biomass, but legumes were rare. The site with the lowest soil N supported the consistently highest legume biomass and lowest grass biomass among sites. The least productive site displayed the highest percentage of composites. Species evenness, but not richness, was inversely related to August biomass for all sites. There were significant differences in production across years, as well as in percentages of grass, legume, and composite biomass. Total plot richness ranged from 24 to 40 species sampled per year at site 2 to 51-53 species at site 4, and tended to decline in the dry year 1989. Poor soils, although less productive overall, appear to prevent dominance by tall grasses and thereby maintain relatively more diverse spring and summer floras. Increased light availability near the soil surface probably enables the persistence of low-growing plants. Evenness, but not richness, varied among sites. The patterns of plant community composition have implications for restoration ecology as well as the design of prairielike perennial grain mixtures.","OCT  1995","2015-06-03 04:21:00","2015-06-03 04:21:00","","1635-1644","","10","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1995RZ63600015","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Direct comparison of evapotranspiration rates published in the literature is hardly possible, since differences in soils and climate make data incomparable. This paper presents literature data on crop parameters and environmental conditions that determine transpiration for four crops (oil palm, cocoa, maize and rice) and evaporation. Transpiration at leaf scale and soil evaporation as well as evaporation of intercepted rainfall have been computed using these data and are scaled-up to canopy scale. The objective is to quantify evapotranspiration of the crops under identical environmental conditions at two temporal scales: daily and annual evapotranspiration. Variation among crops in transpiration at leaf scale owing to crop characteristics is levelled out in scaling up to canopy scale. Differences in annual evapotranspiration between perennial and annual crops mainly are due to the fact that perennial crops transpire during the dry season, although at low rates, but still considerably higher than evaporation rates of bare and dry soils. Apparently, the degree of soil cover with vegetation in space and in time is of major importance to evaluate differences in annual evapotranspiration caused by changes in land use.","June 1996","2015-06-03 02:43:57","2015-06-04 09:45:37","","17-34","","1–2","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual; Canopy evapotranspiration; Cocoa; Daily; full text added; Leaf; Maize; Oil palm; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; West Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incorporation of farm waste materials such as cane trash, rice straw and legume husk into the soil before cane planting also increased the soil organic carbon content.

The octoploids surpassed Bezostaya 1 by 56% in lysine content of the grain and the hexaploids by 39%. However, amphidiploids had a lower tryptophan content (1.31%) than Bezostaya 1 (1.66%).","1973","2015-06-03 04:37:10","2015-06-03 04:37:10","","125-134","","1","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19731613005","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the genetics of these wild species may enhance their further use in breeding. In this study, sequence variation of the nuclear Lhs1 gene was used to investigate the population genetic structure and gene flow of Oryza rufipogon and O. nivara, two wild species most closely related to O. sativa. The two species diverge markedly in life history and mating system, with O. rufipogon being perennial and outcrossing and O. nivara being annual and predominantly inbreeding. Based on sequence data from 105 plants representing 11 wild populations covering the entire geographic range of these wild species, we detected significantly higher nucleotide variation in O. rufipogon than in O. nivara at both the population and species levels. At the population level the diversity in O. rufipogon (Hd = 0.712; θ sil = 0.0017) is 2-3 folds higher than that in O. nivara (Hd = 0.306; θ sil = 0.0005). AMOVA partitioning indicated that genetic differentiation among O. nivara populations (78.2%) was much higher than that among O. rufipogon populations (52.3%). The different level of genetic diversity and contrasting population genetic structure between O. rufipogon and O. nivara might be explained by their distinct life histories and mating systems. Our simulation using IM models demonstrated significant gene flow from O. nivara to O. rufipogon, indicating a directional introgression from the annual and selfing species into the perennial and outcrossing species. The ongoing introgression has played an important role in shaping current patterns of genetic diversity of these two wild species.","2008","2015-06-03 03:26:33","2015-06-03 20:25:36","","1181-1189","","7","117","","Theor.

Rhizomatousness, a key trait contributing to perenniality, was investigated by using an F2 population from a cross between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relative, Oryza longistaminata. Molecular mapping based on a complete simple sequence-repeat map revealed two dominant-complementary genes controlling rhizomatousness. Rhz3 was mapped to the interval between markers OSR16 [1.3 centimorgans (cM)] and OSR13 (8.1 cM) on rice chromosome 4 and Rhz2 located between RM119 (2.2 cM) and RM273 (7.4 cM) on chromosome 3. Comparative mapping indicated that each gene closely corresponds to major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizomatousness in Sorghum propinquum, a wild relative of cultivated sorghum. Correspondence of these genes in rice and sorghum, which diverged from a common ancestor ≈50 million years ago, suggests that the two genes may be key regulators of rhizome development in many Poaceae. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were identified, most of which also corresponded to the locations of S. propinquum QTLs. Convergent evolution of independent mutations at, in some cases, corresponding genes may have been responsible for the evolution of annual cereals from perennial wild grasses. DNA markers closely linked to Rhz2 and Rhz3 will facilitate cloning of the genes, which may contribute significantly to our understanding of grass evolution, advance opportunities to develop perennial cereals, and offer insights into environmentally benign weed-control strategies.","2003","2015-06-03 03:19:32","2015-06-03 03:19:32","","4050-4054","","7","100","","Proc.

Five vegetable-based cropping sequences on raised beds and six rice-based sequences on sunken beds were tested and compared with rice monocropping (control) under an organic production system. On raised beds, tomato-okra-French bean gave highest rice equivalent yield (REY; 44.7 t ha-1) followed by carrot-okra-French bean (42.5 t ha-1). Rice (cv. Shahsarang 1)-pea (cv.

Employment was enhanced by 187% with potato-okra-French bean and 181% with tomato-okra-French bean on raised beds, whereas rice-pea sequence on sunken beds enhanced employment by 62% over monocropping of rice. The energy productivity (energy output/input) was also higher with these cropping sequences. The adoption of RSB land configuration facilitated 244% cropping intensity (gross cultivated area/net cultivated area × 100) compared with 100% in rice monocropping.

Petkus winter rye, representing S. vulgare, was used as the female parent and was cut back two days before fully earing to delay its development until the pollen of S. montanum should have matured. From a total of 1620 flowers pollinated 17 seeds developed normally. The F 1 hybrids were all more or less intermediate and uniform, 80-100 cm. high, with glabrous ears which were brittle and more like those of S. montanum and had a bristly appearance at flowering time. The leaves were densely covered with hairs on the upper surface. The hybrids were late in maturing and out of 42 normally developed ears (with 1532 spikelets) only 15 ears set seed with an average of about 44 normal grains which were of a good size and relatively well-filled. The seeds from the F 1 yielded 26 plants which developed more or less normally, the rest dying off at various stages. In the F 2, segregation was observed for ear characters, brittleness, pubescence of the leaves, type of stem, growth and general development, perennial and annual habit and many other features. A study of the F 2 material indicated that perennial habit behaved as a recessive character and that from crosses made on a large scale cultivated perennial rye types can be obtained by selection. Brittleness of the ear appeared to be dominant to toughness, though some medium tough ears were also observed in the F 2. The type of ear and awns of S. montanum was dominant, as were also glabrousness under the ear and pubescent leaves, though in the latter case segregation was not clear-cut and inheritance is probably complicated. A cytological examination of the first hybrid generation shewed irregularity at all stages of the first and second division and abnormalities in the number of bivalents formed and in chromosome separation to the poles, resulting in the formation of pollen which was irregular in the number of its chromosomes and in size and form.

Quite high numbers of bivalents were present in the F 1 but in spite of this the reduction division was very irregular and considerable sterility resulted. Similar results were obtained with certain other species of both Triticum and Agropyrum. The F 1 plants were mainly sterile but certain individuals were more fertile than others on pollination with the parents; the plants produced had chromosome numbers that indicated an origin from an unreduced female gamete, being sesquidiploids. The same occurred on pollinating with a third species, so that from the hybrid T. durum x A. intermedium by pollination with T. vulgare a triple hybrid with 56 chromosomes was obtained and by pollination with A. elongatum a triple hybrid with 2n = 70. This latter hybrid was very vigourous in growth, wheat-like in type, perennial and fairly fertile. In these various hybrids pairing occurred between certain of the Triticum and Agropyrum genoms, some of the extra Agropyrum chromosomes remaining as univalents and others pairing autosyndetically. Thus the A, B and D genoms are considered to be homologous in the two genera, though considerably modified during evolution.

"XWT3IQ9V","journalArticle","1939","CICIN, N. V.","Darwinism and distant hybridization.","Jarovizacija","","","","","Referring to Timirjazev's work and his own researches in distant hybridization ( Agropyrum and Triticum), the author doubts the validity of the segregation laws announced by Mendel and opposed to Darwinism by Bateson. Cytogenetics, it is contended, was of little use in directing hybridological researches, as the type of reduction division proved to vary not only within the same hybrid family, but also as broadly within the same individuals; fertility and sterility in hybrids showed no reliable relation to bivalent number and some cases are on record in which univalent hybrids showed relatively high fertility; moreover, fertility seemed to increase with age in perennial Triticum x Agropyrum hybrids; for instance, a perennial hybrid (with annual shoots) was entirely sterile in the first year, but showed almost normal fertility in the following year. Darwin's ideas of selective properties in cross pollination (prepotency) and biological compatibility have been substantiated in recent investigations; for this reason the author reconstructed his hybridological researches; the new breeding schemes assume a free cross pollination, but in such a manner that the same pair is crossed only once. In many cases sterility (biological incompatibility) could be overcome by Micurin's method of vegetative approach (by means of grafting the components). This method was successfully used by the author in distant hybridizations involving annual leguminous plants ( Pisum, Lens, Lupinus, Vicia, Melilotus, etc.) with yellow and white Acacia and some other woody plants. The same method of overcoming incompatibility is desired in grass hybridization ( Agropyrum, Elymus and Triticum), but there are difficulties in technique. In preliminary researches along these lines the outstanding importance of chlorophyll was established in grafting. Etiolated components could not be grafted; only parts rich in chlorophyll showed a tendency to form callus if the conditions subsequent to grafting fostered chlorophyll formation in the callus. The technique of grafting had accordingly to be modified. The components grafted, moreover, must be at the same developmental phase; young tissues formed callus more readily. In conclusion, it is emphasized once more that agrobiological research must be based upon the ideas of Darwin, Timirjazev and Micurin if it is to become progressive as well as useful.","1939","2015-06-03 04:45:35","2015-06-04 09:52:22","","71-82","","5-6 (26-27)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19410700531","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From mid-June to early August A. flavokansiensis feeds on young leaves and inflorescences of D. Ilinoensis. At high density, A. flavokansiensis potentially reduces seed yield and is thus an important consideration for long-term stands that are to be grown without insecticides. The potential to manage this insect via intercropping its host species with other, non-host perennial species by monitoring A. flavokansiensis density on D. illinoensis within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with Tripsacum dactyloides, and three-species mixtures with T. dactyloides and Leymus racemosus was examined. Insects were censused 2-3 times weekly from mid-June to early August at two sites from 1991 to 1995. In the first three years, beetle density was generally low (<1 per plant), and did not differ among treatments. In the fourth year, however, beetle density peaked at 15 and 25 insects per plant at the two sites, and was highest within monoculture for most dates. In 1995, density was again low, but tended to remain higher in monoculture at one site. The results suggest that beetle density on D. illinoensis can be reduced in polyculture and may hold promise for the management of this insect herbivore within perennial grain polycultures.","1996","2015-06-03 03:20:00","2015-06-03 07:33:49","","105-111","","1","81","","ENTOMOL.

All aspects with an important influence on farmers' agricultural production decisions were considered. The information, combined with quantitative information gathered as part of the overall cropping system research effort, was utilized to invent several notional (or potential) new techniques intended to alleviate some of the production constraints facing farmers in Iloilo. These were then ranked according to a number of performance criteria cited by farmers as important. Ratoon rice, the highest ranked technique, was then evaluated using a linear programming model to determine (1) the minimum yields required for adoption, and (2) the potential economic benefit to farmers should it be developed by agricultural scientists.

It involved the farmer as an active participant in the research, with test patterns grown on his land under joint farmer-research management. Experience with the use of this methodology in developing a dryland rice-based cropping systems test site in the Philippines is discussed. The potential for increased crop productivity in the major dryland rice-producing region of eastern Batangas province, where the predominant cropping pattern involves dryland rice followed by field corn, was studied by testing the impact of these cropping pattern alternatives: following rice with field crops other than the local Orange flint corn, an intercrop pattern, and a three-crop-per-year pattern. Cooperating farmers applied the alternative patterns on 1000 m2 plots adjacent to their rice-corn plots. Some patterns showed yield instability and poor pest resistance. None had any adverse effect on the yield of the next rice crop when compared with the traditional pattern. The research opened several directions in which dryland rice-based patterns may be improved. A shift to an improved corn variety showed promise as an effective means of increasing pattern productivity. Soybeans and sorghum were the outstanding alternative crops to follow rice. Intercrops with corn were productive, but may fit only if labour requirements are not excessive and labour productivity is fairly high.","May 1981","2015-06-03 03:07:49","2015-06-04 09:56:28","","269-283","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.rice; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Food security for the poor depends on an adequate supply of food and/or the ability to purchase food. Unfortunately in the world today, more than 3.7 billion people are malnourished because of shortages of calories, protein, several vitamins, iron and iodine (World Health Organization, 2005; Rhodes, 2005). People can die because of shortage of any one of these nutrients or a combination of them. The total of 3.7 billion malnourished people is the largest number ever in history. In the world today, there are more than 6.5 billion humans (PRB, 2006). Based on current rates of increase, the world population is projected to double to more than 13 billion in about 58 years (PRB, 2006). At a time when the world population continues to expand at a rate of 1.2% per year, adding more than a quarter million people daily, providing adequate food becomes an increasingly difficult problem. Conceivably, the numbers of the malnourished will reach 5 billion in a few decades. Reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the US Department of Agriculture, as well as numerous other international organizations, further confirm the serious nature of the global food supply. For example, the per capita availability of world cereal grains, which make up 80% of the world's food supply, has been declining for more than two decades. This decline is taking place despite all the current agricultural and biotechnological facilities available. Malnourished people are more susceptible to numerous diseases, like malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and AIDS. The World Health Organization reports that there are more than 2.4 billion people infected with malaria, 2 billion infected with tuberculosis, 600 million infected with schistosomiasis and 40 million infected with AIDS (Pimentel et al., 2004). In this chapter, we will examine the need to increase and make more rational food production, to conserve natural resources, to reduce food (crop) losses to pests, to consider the possibility and benefits of converting annual grains into perennial grains and to consider new crops and innovative minilivestock.","2009","2015-06-03 04:20:25","2015-06-03 04:20:25","","42-58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000293121000004","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","Ferry, N.; Gatehouse, A.

The objective of this study was to determine if O. rufipogon Griff., the wild ancestor of cultivated Asian rice, would be a useful source of genes for introgressing perennial growth habit into cultivated rice. In two trials conducted at the International Rice Research Institute, cultivars were compared with interspecific F1s or with rapidly advanced F4 and BC1F4 families, respectively. After 1 yr, none of the cultivars survived but survival in progeny families ranged from 0 to 85.7%. Average survival for the F1s was 30.6% and only one family out of 31 had no survivors. Correlations between F1 family survival and parental O. rufipogon vigor at 9 mo and 20 mo indicated that at least 1 yr is needed to identify perennial genotypes. Fertility among the progeny was generally good, which should facilitate further breeding efforts. In contrast to the cultivars, which produced only one main crop at the end of the wet season, many progenies produced a ratoon crop during the dry season even though they were drought stressed. The ability to produce a dry season ratoon crop under upland conditions is a new opportunity for increasing food security of subsistence upland rice farmers. Breeding perennial cultivated rice should be feasible but it will likely take 5 to 10 more years.","2003","2015-06-03 03:27:04","2015-06-04 09:59:25","","120-128","","1","43","","Crop Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND23329204+&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (rye OR secale) AND NOT (""rye grass"" OR ""rye-grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; perennial N1 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","cultivars; drought; fecundity; genes; mortality; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; perennials; Philippines; plant breeding; ratooning; water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five hundred seedlings were placed into Petri dishes for each treatment (total 2000). Cytological research was carried out on root tips of plants in C0 and C1 generations. Live seedling rate and tetraploid plant rate were changed by 6.4 – 37.4 % and 8.75 – 37.04%, respectively based on treatments. Plants forming the C1 generation were determined as 68.12% tetraploid, 14.71% diploid, 16.89% aneuploid (13.35% hypoploid, 3.57% hyperploid) and 0.27% triploid. Chromosome numbers of aneuploid plants ranged between 2n=19 - 29 and it was determined that plants having a chromosome number of 2n=27 were the most common.

Chromosome numbers were determined by a modification of the conventional root tip squash technique. Chromosome numbers varied with seed size. The rate of tetraploids, diploids and aneuploids were varied between 17.86-87.25%, 2.04-42.86%, 10.71- 39.29 %, respectively. As the size of seed was increased, the rate of diploid and aneuploids decreased. Seed set rate, spike length and the number of spikelets in plants belonging to different generations (C1, C2, C3 and C4) were investigated. Seed set rate was increased from 30.51% to 61.45% with the selection of plants passing over general average in respect to seed  set in each generation, however, it was determined that spike length and number of spikelets decreased. The differences were generally highly significant.","2011","2015-06-03 04:34:39","2015-06-04 10:07:20","","23-28","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000292018300004","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis of variance of plot mean showed significant differences among parents and their crosses in the ratoon traits. The regressions of covariance (Wr) on variance (Vr) were significantly different from unit slope. The array 'Satominori', therefore, was eliminated, and the resulting 5 .times. diallel set was reanalyzed by analysis of variance and a Wr, Vr graph analysis. Wr, Vr graph indicates the absence of non-allelic interaction in the ratoon and a Wr, Vr graph analysis. Wr, Vr graph indicates the absence of non-allelic interaction in the ratoon traits. Additive and dominant variance were significant in the percentage of tillers and height of ratoon plant. In the percentage of ratoon tillers the average degree of dominance indicates perfect dominance. Recessive alleles were in excess for this trait. In ratoon height the average degree of dominance indicates partial dominance. The trait possesses dominant and recessive alleles in more or less equal proportion. Negative correlations were observed between (Vr + Wr) and a measure of ratoon traits of parents, the percentage of ratoon tillers and ratoon height.

A total of 603 miRNAs, 380 known rice miRNAs, 72 conserved plant miRNAs, and 151 predicted novel miRNAs were identified as being expressed in aerial shoots and rhizomes. Additionally, 99 and 79 miRNAs were expressed exclusively or differentially, respectively, in the two tissues, and 144 potential targets were predicted for the differentially expressed miRNAs in the rhizomes. Functional annotation of these targets suggested that transcription factors, including squamosa promoter binding proteins and auxin response factors, function in rhizome growth and development. The expression levels of several miRNAs and target genes in the rhizomes were quantified by RT-PCR, and the results indicated the existence of complex regulatory mechanisms between the miRNAs and their targets.

We investigate here the diversity of the Ty1-copia retrotransposon Tos17 in the cultivated rice of Asian origin (Oryza sativa L.) and related AA genome species of the Oryza genus, to contribute understanding of the complex evolutionary history in this group of species through that of the element in the lineages. In that aim, we used a combination of Southern hybridization with a reverse transcriptase (RT) probe and an adapter-PCR mediated amplification, which allowed the sequencing of the genomic regions flanking Tos17 insertions. This analysis was carried out in a collection of 47 A-genome Oryza species accessions and 202 accessions of a core collection of Oryza sativa L. representative of the diversity of the species. Our Southern hybridization results show that Tos17 is present in all the accessions of the A-genome Oryza species, except for the South American species O. glumaepatula and the African species O. glaberrima and O. breviligulata. In O. sativa, the number of putative copies of Tos17 per accession ranged from 1 to 11 and multivariate analysis based on presence/absence of putative copies yielded a varietal clustering which is consistent with the isozyme classification of rice. Adapter PCR amplification and sequencing of flanking regions of Tos17 insertions in A-genome species other than O. sativa, followed by anchoring on the Nipponbare genome sequence, revealed 13 insertion sites of Tos17 in the surveyed O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata accessions, including one shared by both species. In O. sativa, the same approach revealed 25 insertions in the 6 varietal groups. Four insertion sites located on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, and 11 were found orthologous in O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The chromosome 1 insertion was also shared between O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata. The presence of Tos17 at three insertion sites was confirmed by retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) in a sample of O. sativa accessions. The first insertion, located on chromosome 3 was only found in two japonica accessions from the Bhutan region while the second insertion, located on chromosome 10 was specific to the varietal groups 1, 2, and 5. The third insertion located on chromosome 7 corresponds to the only insertion shown active in rice so far, notably in cv. Nipponbare, where it has been extensively used for insertion mutagenesis. This copy was only found in a few varieties of the japonica group 6 and in one group 5 accession. Taken together, these results confirm that Tos17 was probably present in the ancestor of A-genome species and that some copies of the element remained active in some Oryza lineages-notably in O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata-as well as in the indica and japonica O. sativa L. lineages.","2009","2015-06-03 03:26:19","2015-06-03 20:58:10","","633-652","","6","282","","Mol.

Nucleotide diversity at silent sites of O. rufipogon Pita was 0.0101, an intermediate value relative to other O. rufipogon nuclear genes. A dimorphic pattern of nucleotide polymorphism was detected in the O. rufipogon Pita region.Inoculation of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae verified that the O. rufipogonPita gene resides in a dimorphic sequence type. The resistance Pita allele had lower levels of variation than the susceptibility pita allele. A hypothesis of evolutionary relationships indicated that the amino acid mutation in the O. rufipogonPita protein responsible for the difference between resistance and susceptibility occurred relatively recently. These results suggested that the resistance Pitaoriginated from the susceptibility pita. Nucleotide diversity at replacement sites of the leucine-rich domain (LRD) of both the resistance and susceptibility O. rufipogon pita was low. In tests of neutrality, significantly negative values were detected for the LRD of O. rufipogon susceptibility pita. The low nucleotide diversity at replacement sites of the LRD of the susceptibility pita could be explained by purifying selection.

The sprouting shoots may live owing to the previously formed roots, the active parts of which at the time of shoot formation in the middle of the summer are at a considerable depth; and, therefore, drying of the upper soil layers does not cause death of the newly formed shoots which are incapable of developing roots until the autumn rains. This character, acquired by natural selection, is the cause of perennial nature of the cereals which form new organs of vegetative reproduction during the dry summer period on old reproductive stalks, and it is especially important for cereals of the steppe, semidesert, and desert zones. Consequently, in cultivation of perennial cereals in arid conditions moisture must be conserved in the deep layers of the soil even if it cannot be preserved in the upper layers.","1955","2015-06-03 04:38:42","2015-06-03 04:38:42","","371-373","","(2)","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19573100015238","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigated the nucleotide diversity, divergence and gene flow between Oryza nivara and O. rufipogon using sequences of seven chloroplast and nuclear loci. By analysing samples from 26 wild populations across the geographic ranges of the two species, we showed that both species were highly structured and O. rufipogon maintained a higher level of species-wide diversity than O. nivara. Notably, phylogenetic, amova and F ST analyses were unable to detect significant nucleotide differentiation between the two species. We estimated that the two species began to diverge at c. 0.16 million years ago. Our coalescent-based simulations strongly rejected the simple isolation model of zero migration between species, but rather provided unambiguous evidence of bidirectional gene flow between species, particularly from O. rufipogon to O. nivara. Our simulations also indicated that gene flow was recurrent during the divergence process rather than arising from secondary contact after allopatric divergence. In conjunction with different morphological and life-history traits and habitat preference in the two species, this study supports the hypothesis that these Oryza species are better treated as ecotypes that diverged quite recently and are still under the process of divergence. Importantly, we demonstrate the ecological divergence between O. rufipogon and O. nivara in the presence of significant gene flow, implying that natural selection plays a primary role in driving the divergence of the two Oryza species.","2010","2015-06-03 03:26:10","2015-06-03 20:26:10","","2439-2454","","12","19","","Mol.

At the center of this work is an effort to develop perennial poly-culture as an alternative to industrial agriculture. The latter dominant model of food and fiber production is shown to involve severe problems in terms of short-run ecological costs and long-run sustainability. It is also argued that the perennial poly-culture model has much to recommend it to radical economists as a corrective to capitalist inefficiency. Finally, notwithstanding Jackson's facile criticism of Marx, it is argued that Marx's own writing actually anticipates Jackson's agro-ecological critique of capitalism.","2009","2015-06-03 03:18:48","2015-06-03 21:04:25","","186-195","","2","41","","Rev.

Changes in nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate and root activity were analysed and their effects on dry matter accumulation and grain yield formation were determined. The results showed that the changing tendency in nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate in different treatments was similar under different N application modes in different developmental stages of the first cropping rice and its ratoon rice, showing an increase at the early stage, peaking at the booting stage and then gradually declining in the first cropping rice. It rapidly increased again at full-heading stage and then rapidly declined at the ripening stage of the ratoon rice. It was also found that bleeding rate continuously declined after the booting stage of the first cropping rice. However, during the ratooning cropping, it gradually increased at the budding and tillering stages, reached a peak at full-heading stage and then gradually declined at maturity. The result indicated that N supply enhanced nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate and root activity. This therefore suggests that the proportion of N supply should be increased to enhance these parameters during the middle and late growth stages of the first cropping rice. The good pratoce in N fertilizer application can also enhance root activity, especially at the booting stage of the first cropping rice. This, in turn, can result in increased dry matter accumulation of the first cropping rice and, consequently, high grain output of the ratoon rice.","2009","2015-06-03 04:47:55","2015-06-03 04:47:55","","643-646","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093238055","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: The super rice variety Zhongzheyou 1 was used to compare the morphological and economical characteristics of first and ratoon crops for super rice sown on different sowing dates (19th, 24th and 29th March and 3rd and 8th April) in Rongshui and Sanjiang counties. Result: The results showed that the leaf-age, basal seedlings, max seedlings and effective panicles of first cropping increased with the delay of sowing dates for 5 days, while the panicle setting rate, grains per panicle, full grains per panicle and yield were decreased. The initial heading stage, full heading stage and maturity stage of first cropping also delayed for 1-4 days and the whole growth period shortened by 1-4 days. The growth duration was also delayed in ratoon cropping and most of the characteristics worsened. Under suitable climatic conditions, the stubble of ratoon rice should be kept higher to elongate growth period for getting high yield. Conclusion: The suitable sowing date for super rice planting areas with 140-250 m elevation ranged from 19-24 March and may be delayed, and the stubble height of ratoon cropping kept higher to get higher yield.","2011","2015-06-03 04:47:31","2015-06-03 04:47:31","","890-894","","8","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20113327577","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first year, harvesters with three types of equipment (straw chopper, straw spreader, without chopper and spreader); two heights of cutting and four fungicide treatments were evaluated. In the second year, besides harvesting equipments, three stubble management practices (compactor roll, straw chaffer and without management) and five fungicide treatments were assessed. The straw chopper was superior in increasing the grain yield and quality, in comparison with normal harvest without utilizing this equipment. The fungicide applications increased grain yield and reduced incidence of grain discoloration and consequent improvement in the quality of the product.

N agronomic efficiency in the N 3 treatment was 20.66 kg/kg, 14.97 and 12.34% higher than in N 1 and N 2. Furthermore, the results showed that different N proportion between basal-tiller dressing and panicle dressing with a constant N supply (225.00 kg/hm 2) in the first cropping rice had no significant influence on the ratoon rice crop.","2010","2015-06-03 04:47:38","2015-06-03 04:47:38","","50-56","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20103065657","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil core samples were collected on two dates during main crop development to estimate immature L. oryzophilus populations followed by main and ratoon crop harvests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that planting date did not affect the density-main crop yield relationship during most years and that these relationships varied substantially among years. For ratoon crop yield, an effect of main crop L. oryzophilus immature infestation was detected during some years, but the real effect of these populations on ratoon crop yield remains unclear. Using estimates of yield reduction per L. oryzophilus immature, economic injury levels were calculated. Main crop yields from treated plots and first soil core sample L. oryzophilus immature populations from untreated plots were significantly higher in plots planted at recommended dates than in plots planted earlier or later. This suggests that the presence of high populations of reproductive L. oryzophilus coincides with the period when rice fields planted at optimum dates are flooded. Results from this study reinforce the importance of managing L. oryzophilus populations when planting rice at recommended dates in southeastern Texas.","AUG  2009","2015-06-03 04:47:43","2015-06-03 04:47:43","","1536-1545","","4","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000268647600020","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In forage rice production, it is important to maximize the nutrition in leaf and stem, especially leaf sheath plus stem (stem) due to the high ratio to the whole plant weight, rather than in panicle, to minimize the overall loss of nutrition from the crop. In the total of the first and second crops, stem estimated TDN yield was lower when the first crop had been cut at a height of 15 cm (517 g m-2) than 5 and 0 cm (576 and 598 g m-2, respectively). In the second crop in 2006, stem estimated TDN concentration decreased from 541 to 478 g kg-1 with increasing cutting height from 0 to 15 cm, because the organic cel-lular contents (OCC), which include starch and sugar, concentration decreased. The second crop headed earlier with increasing cutting height. Thus, although starch was translocated from the stem to the panicle in the second crop when the first crop was cut at a height of 15 cm, insufficient starch was translocated to the panicle when the first crop was cut at 5 and 0 cm because of the low temperatures after heading. To reduce the overall loss of nutrition from a crop, it is effective to cut stubble lower. In the second crop, whole plant estimated TDN concentration and yield was not greatly influenced by equipment traffic treatment.","2010","2015-06-03 04:09:58","2015-06-03 20:56:08","","972-980","","3","102","","Agron.

Harvest time and interaction of harvest time and harvesting height had no significant influence on experimental characteristics. On the basis of the results the highest plant height, flag lead length, panicle length, grain yield, straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were obtained on 29 th August harvesting time. There were no significant differences between harvesting height treatment, but the highest yield was related to harvesting height of 40 cm. The low grain yield of the rice may be attributed to the poor management of cutting height and harvesting time during the cultivation and harvesting period.

Ratooning rice yield is directly related to the rate of ratooning bud germinating into spikes, and thereby enhancing ratooning bud germination is a key element for ratooning rice high yield. Numerous studies on rice eco-physiology have shown that nitrogen application enhances bud development also strongly promotes ratooning bud germination. However, the molecular mechanism of nitrogen application for bud development to promote ratooning bud germination has remained unclear. This paper studied the effects of nitrogen application for bud development on protein expression of ratooning buds of rice and the corresponding physiological characteristics by using comparative proteomics and relative physiological indicators. A total of 20 differentially expressed proteins were detected in different treatments in 2-DE maps of ratooning bud proteome. The proteins involved in energy metabolism, growth regulation, defense response to stress, etc. The results indicated that the expression abundance of nucleoside diphosphate kinase protein involved in energy metabolism was down-regulated and the proteins involved in photosynthesis (probable photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein and cytochrome b6-f complex iron-sulfur subunit) were up-regulated during ratooning bud germination. Furthermore, protein expressions were higher under nitrogen application treatment than non-fertilization treatment on 7 d and 14 d after nitrogen application for bud development. It suggested that nitrogen application for ratooning bud development significantly slowed the down-regulation of proteins involved in energy metabolism, and promoted the up-regulation of proteins involved in photosynthesis. Thus ratooning buds mediated by fertilization treatment had relatively stronger energy synthesis and photoautotroph capabilities, which better met the needs of energy and material for ratooning bud germination and differentiation. Six protein spots involved in cellular growth and five protein spots involved in resistance were detected and identified in the study. Among them, two protein spots (translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog and actin-depolymerizing factor) were down-regulated and nine protein spots (e.g., germin-like protein, ABA/WDS-induced protein, putative quinone-oxidoreductase QR2, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and dirigent-like protein) were up-regulated during the ratooning bud germination. Furthermore, expression abundance of proteins (e.g., ABA/WDS-induced protein and actin-depolymerizing factor on the 7th and 14th day, germin-like protein on the 7th day of fertilization) was lower under nitrogen application treatment than non-fertilization treatment. Proteins (e.g., translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog, putative quinone-oxidoreductase QR2, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and dirigent-like protein on the 7th and 14th day, germin-like protein on the 14th day) had higher expressions under fertilization treatment than non-fertilization treatment. It indicated that nitrogen application for ratooning bud development relatively cut down the expression abundance of proteins that inhibited ratooning bud germination. Meanwhile, it increased the expression abundance of proteins related to cell division, elongation and resistance, which promoted the germination of ratooning bud and enhanced the ability to resist adverse conditions. Therefore compared with those under non-fertilization treatment, living bud rate and length of the 2nd to the 5th ratooning bud were significantly higher in nitrogen application treatment. As a result, nitrogen application for bud development significantly improved effective panicle number, seed setting rate and grain yield of ratooning rice, which was aimed at getting high yield and significant improvement in ratooning rice production.","2014","2015-06-03 04:46:52","2015-06-03 04:46:52","","1405-1413","","12","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20153025244","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This finding suggests that nitrogen rate does not affect tolerance of rice to L. oryzophilus injury. In the Texas experiment, differences were detected for ratoon crop yield among nitrogen rates and insecticide that were applied at preflood on the main crop, indicating a carryover of fertilizer and insecticide effects from the main to the ratoon crop.

Large amount of dry matter remained in rice stubble after harvesting, thus contributed to the increase of productive tillers and leaf area, and increasing the photosynthetic products of ratooning rice. Optimal nitrogen rates played a very important role in increasing transport rates of dry matter from the stubble and leaves of main rice, thus resulting in significant increases in dry matter accumulation in ratooning rice. In the period from full heading to ripening of ratooning crop, the net accumulation of dry matter, panicle number and grain yield was parabolically related to nitrogen rate used to promote bud and tiller.

The relationship between N uptake and its recovery rate with nitrogen application rates for promoting bud and tiller in main rice and ratooning rice was a parabola curve. After applying nitrogen fertilizer, the amount of N uptake decreased with the growth of crops. About 1/3 of N uptake from the nitrogen fertilizer was deposited in the main rice stubble. The total amount of N accumulated in the stubble was closely related to nitrogen application for promoting bud and tiller, the relationship exhibited a parabola curve. The nitrogen source in the stubble of the main season was gradually transported to the tillers of ratoon crop after the main crop was harvested. It played a great role in bud sprouting and tiller growing. N accumulation in the leaves and stem-sheath of ratoon rice increased with the increase of nitrogen application, and a large amount of N in the parts of ratoon rice were transported to the panicles after full heading. The apparent transportation rate was 57-76% of N translocation from the stubble of the main crop. This fact indicated that the nitrogen transported from the stubble and other parts was the main nitrogen source deposited in grains of ratooning rice. The grain yield of ratooning crop showed a parabolic correlation with the application rate for promoting buds and tillers. The highest grain yield of ratooning crop was obtained with the N application rate of 241.3 kg/ha.","2003","2015-06-03 04:49:16","2015-06-03 04:49:16","","50-55","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20033162760","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to yield of ratooning rice with different stubble heights of the main crop, the eight varieties were classified into three ratooning types, Such as high-stubble type (HST), low-stubble type (LST) and high/medium-stubble type (HMST). Decline of the stubble height resulted in decreased number of effective panicles and increased grain number per panicle in ratooning rice, especially for the grain number per panicle in ratooning rice of LST varieties. The leaf area index in ratooning rice of FIST and HMST varieties was the highest under the high stubble treatment (40 cm), whereas that in ratooning rice of LST varieties increased with the decline of the stubble height. The leaf photosynthetic rates from full heading to 20 days after full heading in ratooning rice of HST varieties were higher under the medium (20 cm) or high (40 cm) stubble treatments, whereas the leaf photosynthetic rates at the full heading stage in ratooning rice of HMST and LST varieties were higher under the high stubble treatment and those at 10 days and 20 days after full heading were higher under the medium (20 cm) or low (10 cm) stubble treatments.

In this paper, the relationship between the decreased index of SPAD value of leaf from full heading to harvesting (DISVLFHH) and ratooning ability, the plant characters of main crop for high yielding combinations of main crop and ratooning rice were studied, which could provide a theoretical and practical basis for improvement of high yield breeding and cultivation of hybrid rice. Method: The experiment was conducted with eighteen mid-season rice combinations grown in a traditional high yield cultivation system, in a randomized block design with 3 replications. The results were analyzed through variance, correlation, regression and path analysis. Result: Alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles and grain yield of ratooning rice were the key traits of ratooning ability, which was a an important approach for further high yield of ratooning rice by increasing effective panicles. There were significant or highly significant relationships between spikelets per panicle, the ratio of leaf area to spikelets, the ratio of leaf area to grains, the ratio of leaf area to grain weight, decreased LAI index, DISVLFHH of main crop and alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles, grain yield of ratooning rice, and the partial correlation coefficient between only DISVLFHH among all trais and alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles, grain yield of ratooning rice got significant at 0.05 level. As for one variety, it's impossible that both main crop and ratooning rice could get top grain yield. The high-yielding combinations for 11.5 t per ha of the theory grain yield and 14 t per ha of potential grain yield for main crop and ratooning rice would have the following source-sink characteristics: 160-190 spikelets per panicle, the ratio of leaf area to grain weight 0.0737-0.0827 cm 2 per mg, DISVLFHH 0.4029-0.5409, effective panicles 232.12*10 4-249.40*10 4 per ha, seed setting percentage 81.54%-85.74%, 1000-grain weight 28.58-30.07 g, grain weight 4.13-4.43 g per panicle.

The highest total dry matter yield was 27.1 t ha−1. We examined the effects of two times of first harvest (booting stage versus full heading stage). Plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 50% higher dry matter yield of first crop than those harvested at the booting stage, because the plants had greater weights per tiller than those harvested at the booting stage. Plants harvested at the booting stage produced 37% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those harvested at the full heading stage, because the plants had greater dry weights per tiller than those harvested at the full heading stage. Overall, plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 8% higher total dry matter yield than those harvested at the booting stage. We also examined the effects of two total amounts of nitrogen (300 kg N ha−1 versus 150 kg N ha−1) and three nitrogen application methods (method 1: 33.3% applied at transplanting, 66.7% at the maximum tiller number stage, 0.0% at 7 days after the first harvest, and 0.0% at 21 days after the first harvest; method 2: 33.3, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively; method 3: 33.3, 0.0, 33.3%, and 33.3%, respectively). For the first crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha−1 produced 10% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha−1 in 2004. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 produced 21% and 23% higher dry matter yield of first crop than plants that underwent method 3, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha−1 treatment and in nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of first crop in these treatments. For the second crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha−1 produced 10% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those that received 150 kg N ha−1. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 produced 57% and 56% higher dry matter yield of second crop than method 1, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha−1 treatment and in nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of second crop in these treatments. Overall, plants that received 300 kg N ha−1 produced 7% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha−1 and plants that underwent nitrogen application method 2 produced 21% and 11% higher dry matter yield than those that underwent methods 1 and 3, respectively.

Taporuri produced the highest total dry matter yield, with a value 60% higher than that of Hinohikari. The first crop of Taporuri had a longer duration of vegetative growth than those of Mohretsu and Hinohikari, and had the highest dry matter yield because of its greater weight per tiller than Hinohikari and its more tillers per square meter than Saikaishi 253, which had a similar duration of vegetative growth. The second crops of Mohretsu, Taporuri, and Saikaishi 253 had longer vegetative growth and higher dry matter yields than Hinohikari. Dry matter yields of both crops were closely related to the duration of vegetative growth and the weight per tiller, but not to tillers per square meter. These results suggest that cultivars with a long duration of vegetative growth, high weight per tiller, and adequate tillers per square meter can produce high dry matter yield in both crops. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) in total dry matter yield between cultivar or line and cultivation type. The total dry matter yield of Taporuri in twice harvesting was about 10% higher than that in once harvesting, whereas that of Hinohikari was about 10% lower. The suitability for twice harvesting ([total dry matter yield in twice harvesting]/[total dry matter yield in once harvesting]) was significantly positively correlated (r = 0.875) with the increase in dry weight before the full heading stage, but significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.903) with the increase in dry weight between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. Thus, cultivars with a high increase in dry weight before full heading appear to be more suitable for twice harvesting than those with a high increase between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. In addition, our study showed that twice harvesting can prevent lodging in Taporuri, thereby increasing the suitability of this cultivar as a forage rice. Our results suggest that twice harvesting can be performed in southwestern Japan and warmer regions.","March 15, 2007","2015-06-03 03:07:01","2015-06-03 20:56:15","","269-275","","3","101","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Asia; Biomass; cropping practice; Crops; Crop yield; cultivar; dry matter; dry matter yield; Dry matter yields; Eurasia; Far East; Forage; Forage rice; Growth kinetics; growth rate; harvesting; Japan; Oryza sativa; Oryza sativa L.; Plants; Ratoon cropping; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Twice harvesting; Vegetation; Web of Science; Yield response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rust-resistant selections of Kanred * Fulcaster and Illini Chief have been produced and have exceeded the standards in yield. Other selections include a naked barley exceeding the standard in yield by 10 per cent. The hybrids of wheat with perennial rye when pollinated with normal pollen set seed mainly from unreduced egg cells. Large numbers of amphidiploids are expected and the work of producing them is being carried out on a mass scale by the workers in the collective farms. The perennial hybrids all have one serious defect, brittle ears, but are drought resistant and of good baking quality. Hybrids have been obtained between cultivated and wild sunflowers, some of which bear both seeds and tubers.","1939","2015-06-03 04:39:19","2015-06-03 08:08:17","","30-32","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19391601844","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In central Taiwan, two generations of the vector small brown planthopper (SBPH) (Laodelphax striatellus) could occur on ratoon rice or wheats during winter. Both the infected plants and the viruliferous SBPH which survived the winter could become the source of rice stripe virus (RSV) in the next year. In the paddy field, SBPH could be detected throughout the year and its population reached a peak in early June and in October on the 1st and 2nd rice crops, respectively. During the period of 1984-1987, a total of 13,546 SBPH were collected in 138 surveys (2 surveys per month) from Da-Tsuen, Changhwa Hsien and Pai-twen, Taichung city. Active transmitters of RSV, as determined by bioassay, were found to account for 6.7% of the collected population. The active transmitters reached a peak during early May to late June in the 1st crop and during late September and early October in the 2nd crop. Analysis of data on disease incidence indicates two main infection periods for RSV in the 1st rice crop. The 1st infection period was from seedling stage to 20 days after transplanting, and the major source of infection was the overwintering insect individuals which were responsible for 1 to 19% of the total RSV infections in the 1st crop. The second infection period occurred about 40 to 60 days after transplanting, and the major infection source was the 1st generation of SBPH multiplied in the paddy field. Over 80% of the total RSV infections in the 1st crop could be attributable to this source. A regression equation: Y = 12.46X - 0.143, where Y is estimation of percent incidence of RSV in the paddy field, and X is the product of natural population and active transmitters of SBPH in March to April, was found suitable for forecasting the infection rate in the first rice crop.","1989","2015-06-03 04:52:20","2015-06-03 04:52:20","","290-303","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199089108760","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tuber traits, which are required for perenniality, and seed yield traits were not correlated, indicating that simultaneous selection may be able to target high yielding lines that also tuberize. The F1 individuals were intermated for one generation and the intermated F1 (IM1F1) showed increases in head size (up to 20%) compared to the best F1 individual. The lack of correlation between tuber and seed traits coupled with phenotypic improvement after one generation of intermating suggest that the best improvement strategy for perennial sunflower is a recurrent selection program focusing on yield.","January 2014","2015-06-03 02:26:27","2015-06-04 08:39:28","","254-264","","0","155","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agricultural production; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); alternative agriculture; Correlation; ecosystem service; Ecosystem services; Flow cytometry; full text added; habitat type; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus; Helianthus doronicoides; Helianthus tuberosus; herb; hybridization; Interspecific hybridization; Interspecific interaction; Perennial grain; perennial plant; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); perennial W/1 sorghum; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); phenotype; Phenotypic correlation; population structure; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; search.sorghum; search.wheat; Selection; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science; wild population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many research objectives with the species depend on knowledge of available genetic resources, but the diversity in northern accessions of Illinois bundlefiower is unknown. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that genetic variation for selected characters exists within and among a set of northern accessions of Illinois bundleflower. From this, we could determine the distribution of variation among the accessions and examine the phenotypic correlations among characters. We evaluated 20 accessions at Becker and St. Paul, MN, and 18 accessions at Sioux Center, IA. Within-accession diversity was determined by a progeny test at Rosemount and St. Paul, MN. Every measured character was influenced by accession (P < 0.05) in at least one location. Therefore, the accessions evaluated can provide much of the genetic diversity needed to develop cultivars adapted to the northern USA. Much of the variation can be explained by latitude of origin. Southern accessions had the greatest forage and seed yield potential, were later maturing, but lacked persistence in Minnesota. Variation (P < 0.05) for characters including seed yield and survival was also found within accessions. Within year and location, average seed crude protein (CP) concentration and seed weight were correlated (average r = 0.71, P < 0.05). Within location in August, forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was negatively correlated with leaf fraction (average r = -0.89, P < 0.001), and leaf and pod fraction were negatively correlated (average r = -0.80, P < 0.01).","2003","2015-06-03 03:19:31","2015-06-03 03:19:31","","1528-1537","","4","43","","Crop Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Desmanthus; Desmanthus illinoensis; Desmodium; Embryophyta; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of main-crop stubble height on ratoon grain yield, agronomics, and cumulative/weekly panicle growth parameters (density, point of origin, and weight). Main-crop ‘Cocodrie’ and ‘Trenasse’ rice cultivars were harvested to leave either a 40- or 20-cm stubble height. When the main-crop stubble was harvested at 20 cm, ratoon rice grain yield in 2007 was increased by 375 and 190 kg ha−1 for Cocodrie and Trenasse, respectively. Yield was not improved in 2006 using the low (20 cm) harvest height. The yield advantage in 2007 was associated with the increased weight of the basal panicles when the main crop was harvested at 20 cm. When the main-crop stubble was 20 cm, basal and axial panicle points of origin were numerically similar 5 weeks after main-crop harvest (WAH), while panicles originating from basal nodes were predominant 6 WAH and beyond. In contrast, when the main-crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes 5 WAH, panicles from both axial and basal points of origin were nearly identical 6 WAH, and basal panicles were dominant thereafter. Results from this study indicate that when the initial stubble height is reduced from 40 to 20 cm the growth of the ratoon crop is altered by shifting panicle point of origin during the early growth period and delaying maturity.","December 12, 2009","2015-06-03 03:06:55","2015-06-03 08:11:02","","396-403","","3","114","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44286387&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; Agronomy; ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); cropping practice; Crop production; Crop yield; cultivar; growth rate; harvesting; height; Oryza sativa; Ratoon; ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; stubble; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science; yield","agronomic traits; grain crops; harvesting; height; inflorescences; Louisiana; Oryza sativa; plant growth; ratooning; rice; seed set; stem nodes; stubble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 24 parents and 144 crosses were grown separately in contiguous blocks in a randomized block design with two replications in three treatments each in 2000 and 2001 at the Research Farm, Bajra Section, Department of Plant Breeding, CCS HAU, Hisar. The plot size was 2.5 m × 0.45 m with 10 cm intrarow spacing. The genotypes (A lines, B lines, R lines, A × R crosses, B × R crosses), sowing dates, years, year × sowing date and genotype × treatment interactions (direct and reciprocal) exhibited significant differences. The comparison of mean performance of the early-sown non-ratooned crop vs. ratooned (cut, regenerated) vs. late-sown unratooned crop treatments revealed that both the grain and dry fodder yields and the major yieldcontributing characters exhibited little reduction in the ratoon crop, while the total tillers at maturity and the effective tillers increased in the ratoon crop in comparison to the directsown crop. Additional green fodder yields of 189.63 g and 144.02 g per plant, harvested 40 days after sowing (DAS) in the ratoon crops in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and similar grain and dry fodder yields emphasized the utility of cutting and regeneration in pearl millet. The ratooning ability of genotypes, assessed from the ratio of the performance of various characters in ratoon and early and late sown unratooned crops for yield and major yield components was high for a number of lines, testers and hybrids. Most of the hybrids involved one or two parents with good regeneration potential. Sufficient genetic variability was observed for regeneration and ratooning ability, which was found to be under genetic control, suggesting that regeneration potential could be incorporated in genotypes with high yield. A base population developed from promising parents and crosses can be improved by cyclic breeding.","2005","2015-06-03 04:10:34","2015-06-03 20:50:59","","423-432","","4","53","","Acta Agron.

A field experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 cropping season to compare the performance of sowing methods. Dry dibble broadcast, pre-germinated broadcast, dry dibble, transplanted and pre-germinated broadcast methods of early maturing New Rice for Africa 1 (NERICA 1) upland rice were compared with ratooned crop of New Rice for Africa Lowland rice (NERICA-L) genotypes (NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 26, NERICA-L 44, NERICA-L 41 and OFADA) in the niche between lowland rice and dry season cropping. The first crop was planted in May while the second and third were in September and December. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replicates. The mean plant height, grains panicle -1, panicles m -2, 1000-grain weight and grain yield of lowland rice varieties were 126.5 cm, 220, 173, 29.3 g, and 7.75 t ha -1, respectively. The ratooned lowland rice flowered earlier (28-37 days) than the upland rice sowing methods (66-77 days). Ratooned crops of NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 26 and NERICA-L 44 had highest number of panicles m -2 and grain yield while pre-germinated dibble upland rice and ratooned crop of OFADA had the least panicles m -2 and grain yield, respectively. Transplanted upland rice and pre-germinated broadcast methods had better grain yield than any of the sowing methods of upland rice. The fresh leaf weight of fluted pumpkin ( Telfairia occidentalis Hook F.) ranged between 14.59 and 19.77 t ha -1. Ratooned crops had better agronomic and economic performance than the upland rice. Hence the productivity of triple cropping in the inland valley could be efficiently utilized by adopting ratooning lowland rice.","2012","2015-06-03 04:47:18","2015-06-03 04:47:18","","226-234","","11","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20133039005","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first crop was harvested with a small plot combine with the cutter bar adjusted to leave a stubble height of 20 or 40 cm. After the main crop harvest, panicles in a flagged 3-m linear section were tagged weekly as they emerged from 3 to 10 weeks after harvesting (WAH). In 2006, ratoon rice yield was not improved when the ratoon stubble was reduced to 20 cm, which was partially due to narrow brown leaf spot outbreak. In 2007, ratoon yields were not limited by the disease, and grain yields were improved when the initial stubble height was 20 cm compared with the traditional 40-cm stubble. When the main crop stubble was 20 cm, the basal and axial panicle points of origin were similar at 5 WAH. A higher density of ratoon panicles originated from basal nodes at 6 WAH and beyond. However, when the main crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes at 5 WAH. Densities of panicles emerging from basal and axial nodes were nearly identical at 6 WAH. After 6 WAH, greater panicle density was observed from basal nodes. Thus, the delay in maturity often associated with shorter main crop stubble heights can be explained partially by the minimum exertion of panicles from tillers originating from axial nodes, which is more prevalent from the taller ratoon stubble associated with a ratoon height of 40 cm.","2009","2015-06-03 04:48:01","2015-06-03 04:48:01","","8-9","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093331791","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field experiment on double cropping of rice was conducted under mid-altitude subtropical wetland valley ecosystem of Meghalaya from 2004-05 to 2005-06 at Umiam (950 m amsl), Meghalaya. Out of the six varieties tested, IR-64 (43.2 q/ha), Aerobic rice IR 72176 (42.1 q/ha) and Krishna Hamsha (40.5 q/ha) performed well during pre-kharif season. Double cropping (main + ratoon) of IR-64 produced 75.4 q/ha of grain yield compared to 40.5 q/ha under improved monocropping of rice variety Sahsarang-1. Ratooning could save time (nursery and field preparation, transplanting, etc.), resources (labour, seeds, etc.) and gave higher productivity. The ratooning ability of Sahsarang-1 (33.0 q/ha) and IR-64 (32.2 q/ha) was found to be highly promising. The sequence IR-64 in pre-kharif followed by its ratoon also gave 86 and 202% higher productivity over improved (40.5 q/ha) and local practice (25.0 q/ha) of monocropping respectively. It was found equally good with the best combination of IR-64 in pre-kharif followed by late kharif transplanted crop of Vivek Dhan-82 (system productivity of 80.4 q grain/ha). Duration of main crop varied from 135 to 158 days, whereas in case of ratoon it varied from 70 to 95 days. Therefore, it was concluded that ratooning has ample opportunity, especially in the NER region of India, where climatic conditions and non-availability of resources restrict the double cropping of rice by the farmers. The practice of double cropping would not only add to the national food basket, but would also increase the farmers' income and generate more employment in the region.","2009","2015-06-03 04:10:11","2015-06-03 08:22:07","","1620-1627","","12","96","","Curr.

There is a need to develop effective strategies for improving crop performance in organic systems through plant breeding. This study evaluated 12 diverse winter wheat breeding lines chosen from conventional and organic breeding nurseries, six historic varieties, and an experimental perennial wheat population under organic management in the Inland Pacific Northwest region of the USA. A randomized complete block design with three replications in two locations over 2 years was used. Based on an analysis of variance, significant genetic differences and crossover interactions across years were found for grain yield, grain percent nitrogen, grain total nitrogen, and aboveground biomass. There were no main effects of locations or location-by-genotype effects for these traits. Based on comparisons among these breeding lines, it appears that there is a possibility of selecting for performance across a limited ecological zone as top-yielding lines were the same in both locations. However, individual entries may have variable performance across years within a single location so selection for stability of performance over years is also necessary. Using an analysis of direct measures of grain yield and grain %N in each location-year combination and overall, we identified breeding lines with relatively high yield, acceptable grain protein, and stable performance over all four location-year combinations. The use of indirect measures or index selection to simultaneously select for grain yield and protein did not appear to be more effective than direct selection based on yield and grain %N measured under organic management.","2011","2015-06-03 04:05:15","2015-06-03 08:22:59","","65-80","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND500587800&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); nitrogen use efficiency; Organic plant breeding; perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat); relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science; winter wheat","aboveground biomass; analysis of variance; breeding lines; crops; cultivars; ecological zones; environmental management; grain protein; grain yield; management systems; nitrogen; nitrogen content; organic production; Pacific States; plant breeding; selection index; winter wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found that a short-season mungbean (Vigna radiata) crop could be taken before the commonly-grown castor crop but that castor yields were reduced by the delayed sowing. If the castor was sown after the harvest of mungbean in a sequential system the profits were less than from a sole castor system. Relay-sowing the castor 20 days before the harvest of mungbean gave 9 $US ha−1 greater profit than sole castor, but this is probably not enough to justify the more intensive double crop system. On the other hand a reasonable yield of horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) could be produced after an early pearl millet crop, giving a worthwhile extra profit of 21 $US ha−1 compared with sole pearl millet. Ratooning the sorghum gave ratoon yields that averaged only 14% of the first crop, so this system was not considered suitable for these lighter Alfisols.Intercropping systems of pearl millet/groundnut, sorghum/pigeonpea and groundnut/pigeonpea gave average yield increases of 24, 47 and 46%, respectively, compared with both component crops grown separately. Compared with growing only the higher value sole crop, increases in profits were 16, 82 and 120 $US ha−1 for the same three systems, respectively.

Berken and Kiloga, and each of two Australian accessions of the wild subspecies (V. radiata ssp. sublobata). One of the wild accessions, ACC 1, was representative of a prostrate, fine-stemmed, gracile type and the other, ACC 87, was representative of a more robust perennial form endemic in north-eastern Australia. For each of the four cultivatedwild populations, trait expression was observed in plants from the parent, F1, F2, and the two F1parental backcross generations, when grown under favourable conditions in large pots on benches in the field at CSIRO Davies Laboratory, Townsville, Australia. Models of inheritance were inferred based on the segregation patterns in the different generations of the cultivated v. wild phenotypes. For most traits, the model of inheritance depended more on the wild than the cultivated parent, with more traits in the crosses involving ACC 1 being digenic than in those involving ACC 87. For all the observed morphological and seed traits, the wild phenotype was dominant, consistent with the cultivated phenotype having arisen through mutations that inhibited expression of the wild type. In contrast, the apparent resistance of the wild parents to field strains of powdery mildew disease was recessive to the strong susceptibility of the two cultivars. The segregation patterns for presence or absence of tuberous roots were remarkably similar in the two crosses involving the perennial accession ACC 87, and were consistent with the formation of tuberous roots being conditioned by two complementary, dominant genes. The fact that an apparently complex trait like perenniality might be conditioned by so few genes suggested that perenniality may also be an ancestral wild trait, disruption of which has led to the now more common, annual form.

Ethiopia being the centre of origin and diversity for sorghum, the crop has been cultivated for many thousand years. In order to quantify socio-ecotype differentiation, varietal mixture and selection efficiency both survey research and field experiments were undertaken. Sorghum is found to be widely grown in the study area and adaptively differentiated into races, ecotypes and varieties. The typical Durra race is found in the lowlands; Durra, DurraCaudatum, and Caudatum are found in the intermediate altitude and Bicolor-Caudatum, Guinea-Caudatum and Bicolor races are found in the highlands. Ecotype differentiation resulted in ecotypes and varieties specifically adapted to the crop growing environments. A transect of variety by altitude showed a genotype substitution over altitudinal ranges from the lowlands to the highlands. Socio-ecotypic differentiation, introduced as a new concept, is the spatial and temporal differentiation of genotypes due to the ecological and socio-economic factors. As a way of managing the varietal mixture portfolio, 39% of the farmers exercise inter-varietal replacement by varieties with better adaptation, quality and yield. Farmers knew that there is no as such a perfect variety and it is practically impossible for a single variety to meet all the requirements. As a result, 6l% of the farmers use varietal mixtures as a complementary strategy. Of these, 96% of them select and compose the varieties in the varietal mixture intentionally. Hence, the varietal components were not random selections but specific combinations. Direct and participatory on farm monitoring showed that the average number of varieties in the varietal mixture per plot was about 10. The mean number of varieties per quadrant was 4.41. The mean frequency of the varieties by type was two per quadrant. Ratooning was practised by 30% of the farmers. The determining factors dictating ratooning were drought (71%) and pest (26%). Transplanting was one of the plant stand management strategies. Farmers' varieties showed significant variation for the yield, 1000 seed weight, plant height, and panicle weight. A significant interaction was also observed for yield between varieties and selection; and farmer and selection. The three major varieties developed by the farmers in each wereda of eastern Ethiopia were identified and have to be promoted for production in areas of ecological adaptation and farmers' acceptance.","2009","2015-06-03 04:12:19","2015-08-31 16:27:58","","25-37","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Adaptative; ALL(ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Center of diversity; Differentiation; Ecotypes; Ethiopia; Farmer breeding; Farmer varieties; Poiycultivar; relevant; Scopus; search.sorghum; Selection efficiency; Socioecotype differentiation; Sorghum; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum bicolor (l.); SPV; Varietal mixture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined an intermated Oryza sativa/Oryza longistaminata population and assessed how fertility barriers affected selection for long rhizomes, a polygenic trait. Rhizomes are typical of O. longistaminata but not found in O. sativa. In the intermate population, we observed that pollen-fertility and self-fertility were generally low but exceptional individuals of high fertility were found in nearly all generations. About 1/5th of the genotypic variation for self-fertility was accounted for by pollen-fertility, based on a significant linear regression. Intermating improved self-fertility more than backcrossing for one generation. Heritability estimates via parent-offspring regression were 17 ± 7% for pollen-fertility and 39 ± 9% for self-fertility. The data indicated that many genes contributed to the fertility barriers. Individuals with relatively high fertility or long rhizomes (>8 cm) were observed infrequently in the intermated population, and there was no evidence of association between low fertility and presence of long rhizomes. By evaluating a large population, we were able to obtain a few rare recombinants that had both self-fertility greater than 10% and long rhizomes.","January 8, 2006","2015-06-03 02:43:39","2015-06-03 21:04:56","","30-38","","1","95","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Crops; Crossability; Farm Crops; Fertility; full text added; Genes; Intermating; Interspecific crosses; Introgression; Oryza; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Proteins; Regression analysis; relevant; Rhizome; Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intercropping could ensure stability of insect populations in a system. A 3-yr (2005-2007) field trial was therefore carried out in Nigeria under regular and ratoon crops to evaluate five recently developed pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Huth) genotypes (ICPL 87, ICPL 161, ICPL 85063, ICP 7120, and ICPL 87119) from the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and one local variety for their relative performance and susceptibility to insect pests. The pigeon pea genotypes were in a mixture with two maize genotypes (Zea mays L., open-pollinated and hybrid) in regular crops for 2 yr (2005-2006) followed by a ratoon crop for 1 yr (2007). Termites (Odontotermes badius), crickets (Gymnogryllus lucens), and variegated grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) were the crop's seedling pests and caused minimal damage. Clavigralla spp. infestations were high at the reproductive stage causing 24% and 29% seed damage in regular and ratoon pigeon pea crops, respectively. Maize slightly suppressed insect pest incidence and damage to pigeon pea pods and seeds but significantly (P < 0.01) reduced grain yield in the regular pigeon pea crops in 2005 and 2006, although not in the 2007 ratoon. The pigeon pea genotypes differed significantly (P < 0.05) in pest incidence at the podding stage in both the regular and ratoon crops and in grain yield (P < 0.01) for the regular crop. Grain yield of the pigeon pea ratoon crops was about 60% of the regular crop. Farmers were recommended to adopt the ICPL 161 and ICPL 87 genotypes based on pest tolerance and high grain yield or as idiotypes in pigeon pea hybridization programs.","JAN-MAR  2012","2015-06-03 04:46:17","2015-06-03 08:26:21","","45-52","","1","72","","Chil.

Perennial wheats Nos 818 and 823, from selections from the F 5 of a cross Truicum sphaero-coccum x Agropyron elongatum, when sown in autumn 1944, came through the winter with survival rates of 97.2% and 97.0% respectively, compared with a survival of 76.2% in the winter wheat Hostianurn 237. Earing was 8-10 days later than in Hostianum 237 and the period from earing to ripening was longer. Observations on 474 different forms of perennial wheat in 1944 and 1945, both bad years for fungus attack, showed 469 of them to be entirely free from brown rust and only one was infected badly; all forms remained free from yellow rust and all but two free from mildew. The average grain yield per plant in Nos 818 and 823 was 3.6 grm. but some yielded up to 8 grm. per plant. Both these hybrids have awnless ears with smooth chaff and tough rachis, are difficult to thresh and have short, red, vitreous or semi-vitreous grain, with a thousand corn weight of 18 grm. Nos 559 and 560, from the F 4 of a cross of the winter wheat Lutescens 329 x A. elongatum, yielded only 0.67 grm. of grain per plant, being characterized by open flowering and cross-pollination; they had large, red, vitreous grains with a thousand corn weight of 26 grm All the perennial wheats have a number of defects such as late maturity, rough ears and small grain and further breeding work is being directed towards removing these defects. Among the more recent hybrids, one series, obtained from the F 6 of a cross T. sphaer-ococcum x A. elongatum, bore ears in 1944 and 1945 and tillered again at the end of 1945 in preparation for a third year. The ears contained over 50 grains each and some as many as 70, owing to the large number of florets per spikelet. The ears and grain were of the wheat type. Another promising hybrid, No. 2271, was selected from the F 4 of a cross of Lutescens 329 x A. elongatum; it has borne ears for two successive years, and in the first winter it had a survival rate of 94.6% as compared with 76.2%; its ears are of the wheat type and it has not been attacked by brown or yellow rust or by mildew. Plants with a still more wheat-like ear were selected from the F 3 of a cross T. turgidum x A. glaucum; when sown in autumn 1943 they bore ears in 1945 and in autumn tillered afresh, producing a good growth in spring 1946; the grain was vitreous and wheat-like. A number of other wheat-like hybrids have the faculty, when autumn sown, of producing a crop of grain and then tillering afresh and producing a hay crop, after which they die. The highest grain yield from these types was obtained in 1945 with 14.88 c. per ha These hybrids are awnless, have wheat-like ears and grain and have remained free from attack by brown and yellow rust and mildew. The yield of autumn hay varied from 12 to 24 c. per ha. By sowing them in the spring two hay crops are obtained, in the autumn of the first and second year respectively, with a grain crop in between. Further selection work is being continued with this type.","1946","2015-06-03 04:45:01","2015-06-03 04:45:01","","145-51","","2-3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19481601518","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A disproportionate share of genes with rhizome-enriched expression was implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism, and abiotic stimuli and development. A high frequency of unknown-function genes reflects our still limited knowledge of this plant organ. A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high (but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes. From cDNA clones showing rhizome-enriched expression, expressed sequence tags forming 455 contigs were plotted on the rice genome and aligned to QTL likelihood intervals for ratooning and rhizomatous traits in rice and sorghum. Highly expressed rhizome genes were somewhat enriched in QTL likelihood intervals for rhizomatousness or ratooning, with specific candidates including some of the most rhizome-specific genes. Some rhizomatousness and ratooning QTLs were shown to be potentially related to one another as a result of ancient duplication, suggesting long-term functional conservation of the underlying genes. Insight into genes and pathways that influence rhizome growth set the stage for genetic and/or exogenous manipulation of rhizomatousness, and for further dissection of the molecular evolution of rhizomatousness.","November 2006","2015-06-03 02:04:03","2015-06-04 11:22:25","","1148-1159","","3","142","","Plant Physiol.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND43851425&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); article; chromosome map; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Dissection; Evolution, Molecular; full text added; gene expression regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; gene library; Genes; Genetic engineering; Genetics; genome; Genome, Plant; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligosaccharyl transferase; Oryza sativa; plant chromosome; Plants; Plants (botany); Proteins; Quantitative trait loci; quantitative trait locus; ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice); Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional; regulatory sequence; relevant; Rhizome; Rice genome; Scopus; search.rice; Sorghum; Sorghum bicolor; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","clones; complementary DNA; developmental stages; evolution; expressed sequence tags; gene expression; gene frequency; genes; gibberellins; hormone metabolism; Oryza sativa; plant organs; quantitative trait loci; regulatory proteins; rhizomes; rice; Sorghum bicolor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A","","","","","Perennial rye has been known in the North Caucasus for some time but was only established as a separate species distinct from S. montanum in 1928 by Grossheim, who named it S. kuprijanovi. Observations are reported which indicate that the local inhabitants have in the past collected the seed of this wild rye for sowing. In spite of a number of defects such as low cold and drought resistance, brittle ear, irregular maturity, susceptibility to rust, etc., it is superior to other perennial ryes in its greater earliness, size of grain, compactness of growth and its capacity to maintain its green condition even at maturity of grain. By late sowing it has even been possible to select lines which ripen when spring sown, which has not previously been possible in perennial ryes. Inbreeding is being practised and by this means certain comparatively self-fertile lines have been isolated which give 30-46 grains per ear. A great many crosses of it with cultivated rye have also been made and the percentage successes in different crosses are tabulated. The perennial habit is dominant in the F 1 and it is thought that hybrids of this kind, combining the perennial habit with the cultivated type of grain, could be used in cultivation; the chief disadvantage up to the present is that lateness and brittleness of ear are also dominant. Large numbers of crosses are being made in the attempt to find combinations in which these undesirable features are absent and at the same time to utilize the phenomenon of heterosis. For the purpose of making these crosses on a mass scale it is necessary to adjust the time of flowering, cultivated rye being about 10 days earlier than S. kuprijanovi; this is achieved either by sowing the latter in spring after vernalization or by cutting down the cultivated rye at the time when the stems begin to elongate. S. kuprijanovi has possibilities as a forage plant and breeding for this purpose is recommended too.","1935","2015-06-03 04:39:43","2015-06-03 04:39:43","","159-65","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19361600868","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The expression of gene effects for some traits varied between the two types of rice. In the early season environment, additive effects were more important than dominance effects on the traits of plant height, flag leaf length, panicle length, and spikelet number of main panicle; however, the reverse was true under the ratooning environment.

The genetic map of the S. bicolor × S. propinquum RILs contains 141 loci on 10 linkage groups collectively spanning 773.1 cM. Although the genetic map has DNA marker density well-suited to quantitative trait loci mapping and samples most of the genome, our previous observations that sorghum pericentromeric heterochromatin is recalcitrant to recombination is highlighted by the finding that the vast majority of recombination in sorghum is concentrated in small regions of euchromatin that are distal to most chromosomes. The advancement of the RIL population in an environment to which the S. bicolor parent was well adapted (indeed bred for) but the S. propinquum parent was not largely eliminated an allele for short-day flowering that confounded many other traits, for example, permitting us to map new quantitative trait loci for flowering that previously eluded detection. Additional recombination that has accrued in the development of this RIL population also may have improved resolution of apices of heterozygote excess, accounting for their greater abundance in the F5 than the F2 generation.

The evolution of annual O. nivara from a perennial ancestor resembling its sister species, O. rufipogon, was associated with an ecological shift from persistently wet to seasonally dry habitats. Here we report a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of phenotypic differentiation in life history, mating system, and flowering time between O. nivara and O. rufipogon. The exponential distribution of effect sizes of QTL fits the prediction of a recently proposed population genetic model of adaptation. More than 80% of QTL alleles of O. nivara acted in the same direction of phenotypic evolution, suggesting that they were fixed under directional selection. The loss of photoperiod sensitivity, which might be essential to the survival of the ancestral populations of O. nivara in the new environment, was controlled by QTL of relatively large effect. Mating system evolution from cross- to self-fertilization through the modification of panicle and floral morphology was controlled by QTL of small-to-moderate effect. The lack of segregation of the recessive annual habit in the F(2) mapping populations suggested that the evolution of annual from perennial life form had a complex genetic basis. The study captured the genetic architecture for the adaptive origin of O. nivara and provides a foundation for rigorous experimental tests of population genetic theories of adaptation.","APR  2009","2015-06-03 04:23:02","2015-06-03 08:30:18","","870-883","","4","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000264379200006","","","","Adaptation; Adaptation, Biological; ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); article; Crop; Crops, Agricultural; evolutionary biology; fertilization (reproduction); Genes, Plant; Genetic analysis; genetic marker; Genetic Markers; Genetics; Genetic selection; genetic variability; Genetic variation; life history; Mating system; natural selection; Oryza nivara; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; perennial plant; Perennial rice; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; Photoperiod; plant gene; QTL; Quantitative trait loci; quantitative trait locus; relevant; reproductive strategy; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; Selection (Genetics); Self-fertilization; SPV; Survival; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science; Zizania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of Oryzalongistaminata Chev. et Roehr and how this variation is partitioned within and between the eight O. longistaminata populations found in the different geographic regions of Ethiopia using simple sequence repeat markers. Five microsatellite markers in 320 samples generated 64 alleles that revealed the presence of large amount of genetic variability (Ho = 0. 225; He = 0. 768; Na = 7. 375; Ne = 6. 565 and P = 0. 744). The F-statistics detected by the microsatellite loci showed Fst = 0. 064 and Fis = 0. 743 and there was no population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genetic diversity results obtained from this data indicated that there are high levels of genetic diversity in the populations of O. longistaminata studied and it is higher within than between populations. Among the eight populations sampled, five populations were identified as priorities for conservation strategies.

Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), the cause of wheat streak mosaic, is a widespread and damaging pathogen of wheat. WSMV is not a chronic problem of annual wheat in the United States Pacific Northwest but could negatively affect the establishment of perennial wheat, which is being developed as an alternative to annual wheat to prevent soil erosion. Fifty local isolates of WSMV were collected from 2008 to 2010 near Lewiston, ID, Pullman, WA, and the United States Department of Agriculture Central Ferry Research Station, near Pomeroy, WA to determine the amount of genetic variation present in the region. The coat protein gene from each isolate was sequenced and the data subjected to four different methods of phylogenetic analyses. Two well-supported clades of WSMV were identified. Isolates in clade I share sequence similarity with isolates from Central Europe; this is the first report of isolates from Central Europe being reported in the United States. Isolates in clade II are similar to isolates originating from Australia, Argentina, and the American Pacific Northwest. Nine isolates showed evidence of recombination and the same two well-supported clades were observed when recombinant isolates were omitted from the analysis. More polymorphic sites, parsimony informative sites, and increased diversity were observed in clade II than clade I, suggesting more recent establishment of the virus in the latter. The observed diversity within both clades could make breeding for durable disease resistance in perennial wheat difficult if there is a differential response of WSMV resistance genes to isolates from different clades.","JAN  2013","2015-06-03 04:40:10","2015-06-03 08:36:58","","98-104","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000312754000010","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); article; capsid protein; Capsid Proteins; classification; DNA sequence; Genetics; genetic variability; Genetic variation; Idaho; isolation and purification; Montana; Phylogeny; Potyviridae; Potyvirus; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; Sequence Analysis, DNA; SPV; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); United States; virology; Washington; Web of Science; Wheat; Wheat streak mosaic virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In both species, the 120-bp sequence was distributed throughout the entire length of all seven pairs of chromosomes. The other species showed weak labeling or few sites of hybridization with the 120-bp sequence. The 480-bp sequence, which is specific to S. cereale, was detected in eight pairs of chromosomes of Thinopyrum intermedium and in one pair of chromosomes of Elymus trachycaulus.

The perennial crops we rely on most for food take several years to reach production maturity and require large spaces to grow, which make breeding new cultivars costly compared with most annual crops. Because breeding perennials is inefficient and expensive, they are often grown in monocultures consisting of small numbers of elite cultivars that are vegetatively propagated for decades or even centuries. This practice puts many perennial crops at risk for calamity since they remain stationary in the face of evolving pest and disease pressures. Although there is tremendous genetic diversity available to them, perennial crop breeders often struggle to generate commercially successful cultivars in a timely and cost-effective manner because of the high costs of breeding. Moreover, consumers often expect the same cultivars to be available indefinitely, and there is often little or no incentive for growers and retailers to take the risk of adopting new cultivars. While genomics studies linking DNA variants to commercially important traits have been performed in diverse perennial crops, the translation of these studies into accelerated breeding of improved cultivars has been limited. Here we explain the “perennial problem” in detail and demonstrate how modern genomics tools can significantly improve the cost effectiveness of breeding perennial crops and thereby prevent crucial food sources from succumbing to the perils of perpetual propagation.","2014","2015-06-03 03:16:46","2015-06-03 20:50:36","","1780-1790","","10","101","","Am.

We evaluated 18 spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars on three organic farms in Washington State for mineral concentration and for grain yield in 2008 and 2009. The G×Year (Y) interactions were found for grain yield and all minerals except Fe, Mn, and P and G×Location (L) interactions were found for grain yield and all minerals except Fe. The G×E (G×L×Y) interactions were found for grain yield and all minerals except for Mn. Grain yield was not consistently correlated with mineral nutrients across years and locations. Among minerals, Mg:P, P:Zn, and Mg:Zn were positively correlated in at least five of six site-years, suggesting the potential for simultaneous selection of these minerals. Grain mineral concentrations of Cu, Fe, and P showed relatively broad adaptation across years when compared with Ca and Mg concentrations. Fewer cultivars were broadly adapted spatially than temporally for stable levels of mineral concentration. Several cultivars had relatively high concentrations of two or more minerals across locations, indicating the potential for farmer utilization of broadly adapted cultivars and varietal blends that will significantly increase grain mineral concentration.","2011","2015-06-03 04:05:19","2015-06-03 04:05:19","","1734-1741","","6","103","","Agron.

Field studies were conducted in 2002 through 2005 to evaluate the influence of gibberellin (GA) applied to the main crop on ratoon-rice yields. Gibberellin at 10 g ai/ha was applied when the main-crop was between 3 days post-flowering and soft-dough. Various cultivars were tested in field research plots at two locations in Texas. The data were analyzed using a paired t-test of medians to evaluate GA-treated plots compared to nontreated plots. Main-crop yields were not influenced by application of GA, while ratoon-crop yields were increased 264 kg/ha by the GA application. Ratoon-crop yields were higher in GA-treated plots vs. nontreated plots in 14 of 17 studies. The very early-maturing vigorous hybrids responded strongly to GA treatment, with average increases in ratoon yield due to the GA treatment of 697 kg/ha.

It contains various valuable traits with respect to tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, QTLs with agronomically important traits and high ability to use nitrogen efficiently (NUE). However, only limited genomic or transcriptomic data of O. longistaminata are currently available.Results: In this study we present the first comprehensive characterization of the O. longistaminata root transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. One sequencing run using a normalized cDNA library from O. longistaminata roots adapted to low N conditions generated 337,830 reads, which assembled into 41,189 contigs and 30,178 singletons. By similarity search against protein databases, putative functions were assigned to over 34,510 uni-ESTs. Comparison with ESTs derived from cultivated rice collections revealed expressed genes across different plant species, however 16.7% of the O. longistaminata ESTs had not been detected as expressed in O. sativa. Additionally, 15.7% had no significant similarity to known sequences. RT-PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the expression of selected novel transcripts in O. longistaminata.Conclusion: Our results show that one run using a Genome Sequencer FLX from 454 Life Science/Roche generates sufficient genomic information for adequate de novo assembly of a large number of transcripts in a wild rice species, O. longistaminata. The generated sequence data are publicly available and will facilitate gene discovery in O. longistaminata and rice functional genomic studies. The large number of abundant of novel ESTs suggests different metabolic activity in O. longistaminata roots in comparison to O. sativa roots.","2010","2015-06-03 03:26:03","2015-06-04 10:49:49","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); article; chromosome map; Chromosome Mapping; complementary DNA; contig mapping; controlled study; DNA sequence; Expressed sequence tag; Expressed sequence tags; Functional genomics; Gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; gene function; Genetics; Genome, Plant; high throughput nucleotide sequencing; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; methodology; molecular genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; nitrogen; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; plant genome; plant leaf; plant root; Plant Roots; plant seed; protein database; pyrosequencing; relevant; reproducibility; Reproducibility of Results; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; search.sorghum; Sequence Analysis, DNA; sequence homology; Southern blotting; species difference; Species Specificity; SPV; Transcriptomics; unindexed sequence; Wild species; Zizania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Selecting varieties that better use organic N could be important in maximizing productivity in organic and low-input systems because these varieties may access a wider pool of available nutrients. We tested amino acid-N uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings over 24 h over a range of soil glycine concentrations. Wheat was grown in 5 ml pipette tips for 10 days prior to labeling with (14)C-labeled glycine. In a second experiment, uptake of amino acid-N relative to nitrate and ammonium was tested in three pre-1940 wheat varieties (Arco, Idaed, and Red Fife), three modern varieties (Alpowa, Madsen, and Zak), and one perennial wheat variety (unreleased). Glycine-N was detected in all shoots (with the exception of the lowest soil concentration) and increased with increasing soil concentration. There were few differences in uptake between individual varieties tested but seedlings of modern varieties were more efficient at capturing organic N than classic varieties. Glycine-N constituted between 3.9% and 8.1% of total N uptake over 24 h and constituted a significantly greater proportion of total N in perennial wheat than annual wheat varieties. These results show that there may be sufficient varietal differences in organic N uptake in wheat to warrant selection for this trait in breeding programs targeted to improving N use efficiency.","AUG  2009","2015-06-03 04:40:32","2015-06-03 08:38:36","","723-732","","7","45","","Biol.

The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale × Secale montanum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus) and linseed (Linum perenne). In some stands, white clover (Trifolium repens) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved N supply. It was found that maturation of the species differed by up to almost 6 weeks, and consequently the threshability of most mixed stands was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, mixtures of either of the grasses (rye or wheatgrass) with lupin or undersown clover proved to be more suitable than pure stands in most cases, for measures such as grain yield, weed suppression and stability of grain yield over years. The grain yield harvested in the experiments in 1999 was low, reaching about 2.7 t ha-1 with rye, and decreased for most species in 2000.

The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N). Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better access to water. On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the shading by the taller pigeonpea. Measurements of root profile of pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved.

There were significant effects of site, treatment, and year on both aboveground biomass and seed yield. On average, bundleflower monoculture produced the greatest aboveground biomass, although the three-species mixture produced the peak biomass (814 g/m(2)) in any given year. Among treatments, Illinois bundleflower monoculture yielded the most seed (maximum = 122 g/m(2)). Overall, biomass and seed yield were higher at the more fertile Site 1, but species differed in their dependence on soil fertility. Among species, bundleflower performed fairly independently of soil fertility, wildrye grew poorly on the less fertile soil, and gamagrass persisted at both sites although it grew less well at Site 2,. In most cases, mixtures produced as well as the best-yielding monoculture. In 26 of 30 instances, biomass relative yield totals (RYTs) were statistically > 1.0 and, in 19 of 21 cases, RYT for seed yield was statistically > 1.0. In general, the overyielding effect appeared stronger at Site 2 than at Site 1, with seed yield RYT appearing to increase with time at Site 2. The results show that the seed yield of perennials can be high, and that some species can persist in mixture for several years. The data for 5 yrs point to the need to follow long-term patterns of yield and interspecific interactions within perennial grain polycultures in order to maintain species diversity and to make reasonable predictions.","March 1998","2015-06-03 02:26:25","2015-06-03 20:58:22","","1-11","","1–2","68","","Agric.

Half of each cultivar was cut at 10cm above the ground at maturity, and the other half remained uncut. Both were grown under two different day-length conditions with a suitable temperature. The growth state at maturity, the changes in the number of living tillers after maturity, and the survival rate after maturity were examined. The starch content in the stem (stem+leaf sheath) of 0. saliva at maturity tended to be higher than that of 0. glaberrima. The nodal root number and the total leaf length of the tiller bud from the node of a stem section at maturity were greater in 0. saliva than in 0. glaberrima. New tillers appeared in both 0. saliva and O. glaberrima after maturity. The number of living tillers after maturity was always greater in 0. saliva than in 0. glaberrima, though the relation was reversed for some period in the long day uncut plot because of the appearance of new tillers from higher nodes. The long day and the uncut conditions enhanced the survival of tillers. In 0. glaberrima, the survival rate of all cultivars at 250 days after maturity was nil. In 0. saliva, japonica cultivars were higher than indica cultivars, including japonica X indica cultivars in the survival rate at 250 days after maturity. All plants of some indica cultivars had died before 250 days after maturity. The long-day condition favored the survival rate. The continued appearance of new tillers in both 0. saliva and O. glaberrima after maturity suggested that both 0. saliva and O. glaberrima had potential perennial ability. It was inferred that the perennial ability of O. glaberrima was very small compared with that of 0. saliva.

This results in intraspecific competition. As in rice fields, C. carpio has basically the same feeding niche as O. niloticus; we found interspecific competition between the two species. O. niloticus consumed relatively more food in the vegetative phase of the rice crop, probably because of a higher abundance of phytoplankton.

We concluded that intraspecific and interspecific competition is an important issue in B. gonionotus culture in rice fields. Besides this, SGR values were higher in the wet season and in plots with inorganic fertilizer or pig manure application.","September 23, 2002","2015-06-03 03:07:31","2015-06-04 11:13:31","","167-178","","1–4","212","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Barbodes gonionotus; Competition; Cyprinus carpio; fish culture; growth rate; Oreochromis niloticus; Paddy field; Polyculture; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice-fish culture; Rice–fish culture; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Sus scrofa; Viet Nam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, since the advent of high-yielding rice varieties and intensive rice cropping, several reports suggest poorer growth performance of the species. In this paper, we investigated the growth performance of T. pectoralis in rice-fish systems characterized by intensive rice culture and extensive to semi-intensive polyculture of Oreochromis niloticus (L.), Cyprinus carpio L. and Barbodes gonionotus (Bleeker). In these systems, T. pectoralis recorded negative net productions. This was mainly the result of a negative specific growth rate (SGR) when fish had to stay in the trench (-0.519% body weight day-1) or when fish had free access to the rice crop (-0.081). Only when harvested rice plants were allowed to generate new tillers (ratooning) did T. pectoralis perform slightly better (0.453% body weight day-l). The SGR of T. pectoralis was low owing to a lack of food in intensive rice systems. The other species, all with SGR values higher than 1% body weight day-1, clearly had a competitive advantage over T. pectoralis. We concluded that intensification of rice cropping did indeed result in poor T. pectoralis growth. Successful T. pectoralis culture is only possible in areas of traditional rice cropping.","2001","2015-06-03 04:10:58","2015-06-03 04:10:58","","913-921","","11","32","","Aquac.

Mlllsp grown inside a highly ventilated greenhouse in 950-mL pots with sand irrigated with either 1.0 (T1) or 0.01 (T2) nM P in the Hoagland solution for a period of 35 or 45 days when growth pressure made differences between P treatments apparent. Results indicated that total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), but not relative leaf area expansion rate (RLAER), were drastically reduced in T2 plants in both species and that root length was reduced by 50% in Desmodium severely stressed T2 plants. The activity of acid phosphatase secreted by the roots in vivo increased under P deficiency in both species. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) of the seemed enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk linear plots were different for the enzyme from T1 or T2 plants in both species. The numerical value of the Km for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-P provided a means of comparing the enzyme from high- or low-P plants, and it is suggested that Km, enzyme activity (Vmax), total leaf area and RGR (during exponential growth), may be used as physiological indicators to differentiate plants grown under P deficiency or sufficiency.","1996","2015-06-03 01:43:19","2015-06-03 08:44:27","","1971-1993","","5/8","27","","Commun.

However, the ability of annually harvested, unfertilized perennial systems to sustain long-term yields while also maintaining ecosystem services has not been widely studied. Here we compare the impacts of harvested perennial grass and annual crop fields on ecosystem functioning in KS, USA. Despite the lack of mineral fertilizer applications, the aboveground harvests of perennial fields yielded similar levels of N compared to those of conventional high-input wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields and at only 8% of the in-field energy costs. Their 75-yr cumulative N yield per ha was approximately 23% greater than that from the region's wheat fields. In terms of aboveground food webs, perennial fields harboured greater numbers and/or diversity of insect pollinators, herbivores and detritivores. Belowground, perennial grass fields maintained 43 Mg ha−1 more soil carbon and 4 Mg ha−1 more soil nitrogen than annual crop fields in the surface 1 m. Soil food webs in perennial fields, as indicated by nematode communities, exhibited greater food web complexity and stability than did those in annual crop fields. In surrounding watersheds, increased annual cropland was correlated with higher riverine nitrate-nitrogen levels. Given their benefits, harvested perennial grasslands provide valuable ecological benchmarks for agricultural sustainability.","April 15, 2010","2015-06-03 02:27:07","2015-06-03 08:45:08","","3-12","","1–2","137","","Agric.

This paper seeks to mesh STS insights with political-economic perspectives by accounting for relationships between availability of diverse technologies, variations in political-economic structures, and farmer interests and characteristics. We present the results of an analysis on the recent development of three wheat varieties: (a) a wheat variety that was modified genetically to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate, (b) wheat varieties with characteristics selected to serve specific markets, (c) and emerging research and development of perennial wheat varieties. Using data obtained through a survey of wheat growers in Washington State, we analyzed whether farmer interest in these three clusters of wheat varieties was associated with distinct individual characteristics and attitudes and whether those characteristics and attitudes are consistent with political economic structures. Although our analysis did not allow us to assess the degree of direct influence that farmers have on the technological development trajectory for these types of wheat, we were able to document variation in technological alternatives and farmer characteristics related to different political-economic trends.","JUN  2011","2015-06-03 04:40:19","2015-06-03 08:46:41","","213-224","","2","28","","Agric.

Oryza longistaminata, a perennial wild rice with strong rhizomes, has been used as the model species for genetic and molecular dissection of rhizome development and in breeding efforts to transfer rhizome-related traits into annual rice species. In this study, an effort was taken to get insights into the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizomatous trait in O. longistaminata by comparative analysis of the genome-wide tissue-specific gene expression patterns of five different tissues of O. longistaminata using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array. Results - A total of 2,566 tissue-specific genes were identified in five different tissues of O. longistaminata, including 58 and 61 unique genes that were specifically expressed in the rhizome tips (RT) and internodes (RI), respectively. In addition, 162 genes were up-regulated and 261 genes were down-regulated in RT compared to the shoot tips. Six distinct cis-regulatory elements (CGACG, GCCGCC, GAGAC, AACGG, CATGCA, and TAAAG) were found to be significantly more abundant in the promoter regions of genes differentially expressed in RT than in the promoter regions of genes uniformly expressed in all other tissues. Many of the RT and/or RI specifically or differentially expressed genes were located in the QTL regions associated with rhizome expression, rhizome abundance and rhizome growth-related traits in O. longistaminata and thus are good candidate genes for these QTLs. Conclusion - The initiation and development of the rhizomatous trait in O. longistaminata are controlled by very complex gene networks involving several plant hormones and regulatory genes, different members of gene families showing tissue specificity and their regulated pathways. Auxin/IAA appears to act as a negative regulator in rhizome development, while GA acts as the activator in rhizome development. Co-localization of the genes specifically expressed in rhizome tips and rhizome internodes with the QTLs for rhizome traits identified a large set of candidate genes for rhizome initiation and development in rice for further confirmation.","JAN 24  2011","2015-06-03 04:22:56","2015-07-14 16:35:14","","18","","","11","","BMC Plant Biol.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000287208300001","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); antibody specificity; article; DNA microarray; down regulation; Down-Regulation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetics; meristem; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Specificity; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; plant gene; plant leaf; Plant Leaves; Poaceae; Principal component analysis; promoter region; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Quantitative trait loci; quantitative trait locus; relevant; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhizome; Rice; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; Sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); upregulation; Up-Regulation; Web of Science; Zizania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this experiment was to determine the distribution of genetic variation within and between Illinois bundleflower accessions by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Semi-automated fluorescence-based AFLP analysis was performed on three individuals from each of 50 accessions. We identified 222 markers, 159 of which were polymorphic. Within-accession diversity was low (Hs = 0.013) compared with total gene diversity (HT = 0.086). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 83% of the molecular variance was explained by two major clusters, supporting a previous phenotypic study that suggested the existence of two distinct races of Illinois bundleflower. The less commonly occurring of the two races contained greater genetic diversity and originated from a localized region in the south central USA. The collection of more accessions from throughout the USA and focused on the Southeast would likely increase the genetic variation available to plant breeders.","2003","2015-06-03 03:19:33","2015-06-03 08:49:52","","402-408","","1","43","","Crop Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND23329354+&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Desmanthus; Desmanthus illinoensis; Desmodium; Embryophyta; perennial N1 grain; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","amplified fragment length polymorphism; Desmanthus; Desmanthus illinoensis; genetic markers; genetic techniques and protocols; genetic variation; geographical variation; germplasm; nitrogen fixation; pastures; plant genetic resources; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The production potential of various rainfed (non-irrigated) crops has been established and new cropping systems devised to help farmers make better use of the soil and climatic resources of each agro-ecological zone. The cropping methods used by local farmers were compared each season with the integrated techniques evolved from crop management research at each research unit. The farmers' own labor, bullocks and equipment were used. Yields were increased substantially by improved varieties, good sowing methods, weed control and fertilizer use. In addition, environmental resources could often be further exploited by growing intercrops and sequential crops. Sequential cropping is traditionally practiced in regions receiving over 1000 mm of rainfall per annum, but there is a great potential for two crops per year in areas now considered marginal, through the introduction of timely seeding and short-durati varieties and crops. Various comparative experiments confirmed that yields could be increased by judiciously and carefully executing management inputs such as advancing the date of sowing, using good seed, planting seed uniformly and at the correct depth (into moist soil) to obtain recommended plant populations, and thorough weeding. This type of management was necessary to obtain additional crop responses to costly inputs such as fertilizers and water management.","1978","2015-06-03 03:09:04","2015-06-04 11:29:22","","103-126","","0","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.sorghum; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental results indicated that the optimal time of cutting the stubble was 2 to 12 days after harvest of the spring crop. Delayed cutting resulted in extended occupation of crop in the field and yield reduction due to low temperature during the grain-filling period. The height of cutting the stubble should be low or close to the ground level. Tillage at 10 days after stubble cutting to cover the ridge with 10-cm soil was also beneficial to the yield performance of ratoon sorghum. For the method of N fertilization, 50% of fertilizer as basal application could be applied at 1 day before stubble cutting, and 25% each could be top-dressed at 20 and 40 days after stubble cutting. An alternative was to apply 50% each of N fertilizer at 10 and 40 days after stubble cutting.

Wildrye and bundleflower, which are also potential grain crops, are not reported to be hosts of the viruses. At Site 1, in 1991 and 1992, disease was generally less frequent and less severe in biculture with bundleflower and in the three-species mixture than in monoculture or the biculture with wildrye. No treatment effects were observed at Site 2. Disease severity was negatively correlated with plant size and seed yield at Site 1.

Global population is growing; demand for food, especially meat, is increasing; much land most suitable for annual crops is already in use; and production of nonfood goods (e.g., biofuels) increasingly competes with food production for land (2). The best lands have soils at low or moderate risk of degradation under annual grain production but make up only 12.6% of global land area (16.5 million km2) (3). Supporting more than 50% of world population is another 43.7 million km2 of marginal lands (33.5% of global land area), at high risk of degradation under annual grain production but otherwise capable of producing crops (3). Global food security depends on annual grains—cereals, oilseeds, and legumes—planted on almost 70% of croplands, which combined supply a similar portion of human calories (4, 5). Annual grain production, though, often compromises essential ecosystem services, pushing some beyond sustainable boundaries (5). To ensure food and ecosystem security, farmers need more options to produce grains under different, generally less favorable circumstances than those under which increases in food security were achieved this past century.

Berolina were given 12 fertilizer treatments ranging from a no-fertilizer control to the NPK rates of the 1st trial plus 12 t chicken manure/ha tuber yields were 11.1-15.4 t/ha with no significant differences. In a 3rd trial in the same season using potatoes cv. Berolina and Cosima mulched with rice straw or unmulched, and planted on 13 or 28 Dec. or 12 Jan., tuber yields were 3.8-15.6 t/ha. Yields were higher in Berolina than in Cosima, increased by mulching, and greatly decreased by planting on 12 Jan. Rice cv. IR66 grown in May-Aug. 1989 following lowland potatoes was given 0, 30, 60 or 90 kg N/ha. Without applied N, residual fertility after 3 years of rice-rice-potato cropping produced a grain yield of 4.11 t/ha. When rice was transplanted rather than established as a wet season crop the yield without N was 5.04 t. N increased the yield of wet season rice to 5.03 t, advanced the flowering date, and increased lodging. All treatments were given 30 kg N/ha 2 weeks before maturity of the main crop, to provide N for the following ratoon crop; the ratoon crop was also given 2 later applications of 30 kg N. The ratoon crop yielded 2.90-3.16 t/ha. Rice cv. IR66 was also sown following potatoes given the 12 fertilizer treatments outlined above. Main crop rice yields were 2.76-4.21 t/ha, and ratoon crop yields 1.87-2.49 t. The highest total yield was produced by rice following 220-70-70 kg NPK + 12 t chicken manure/ha.

Since breeding of new industrial crops targeted for arid lands is not appreciably different from that of traditional crops, higher yield is achieved by increased harvest-index, at the cost of losing traits associated with drought-tolerance and reduced seed-yield stability. Using Lesquerella as a model we compared selected and unselected accessions of annual (L. gracilis and L. angustifolia) and perennial (L. pinetorum and L. mendocina) genotypes grown in field experiments in Patagonia, Argentina. Our objective was to assess the effects of breeding for increased seed-yield on traits related to the main characteristics that define the most common ideotype for mediterranean-type environments: early vigor, conservative growth strategy post-anthesis and reserves storage. Our specific question was: Have any of the attributes associated with seed-yield stability been indirectly selected during the domestication process? Our results show that these characteristics were reduced or lost, in selected lines compared to their wild relatives. Early vigor was lower in selected accessions and was associated mainly with reduced relative growth rate and CO2 assimilation. During the reproductive period the growth strategy was changed by selection towards a non-conservative and more acquisitive resource use strategy. Traits associated with this strategy were linked to higher water use efficiency and growth capacity (higher CO2 assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and leaf allocation), but also with loss of structural adaptation to low resource environments (i.e. low specific leaf area), an increase in nutrient and water demands, and reduced nutrient use efficiency. Carbohydrates accumulation pre-anthesis was lower in selected accessions of all four species, and also, just in perennials we found lower reserves storage post-anthesis. These changes in the pattern of carbohydrates accumulation could be associated to lower seed-yield stability due to the loss of buffer capacity linked with the use of pre-anthesis reserves for seed filling. On the other hand, in perennial species lower reserves storage after seed harvest could reduce plant longevity and survival. We conclude that indirect changes occurred during the preliminary domestication of both annual and perennial species of Lesquerella used in our experiment. These changes were against those required if these species were to be developed as crops for semi-arid, mediterranean environments and should result in low seed-yield stability.","September 2011","2015-06-03 02:28:05","2015-06-03 08:52:36","","1372-1380","","2","34","","Ind.

The alterations in rainfall patterns can have considerable feedback on solar radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture which can affect the ecosystem CO2 exchange. In this paper, we assessed the effects of the ENSO events (2008–mid 2010) on the seasonal climate conditions and determined how it affected the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and net ecosystem production (NEP) of two contrasting rice environments: flooded and non-flooded. The 2008 dry season (DS) was under a La Niña event while the 2008 wet season (WS) was a neutral one with strong tropical cyclones associated during the wet season. The 2009DS was also La Niña while the 2009WS was El Niño; however, the northern part of the Philippines experienced strong tropical cyclones. The 2010DS was under an El Niño event. The La Niña in 2008DS resulted in about 15% lower solar radiation (SR), 0.3 °C lower air temperature (Ta) and 60% higher precipitation compared to the 28-year climate normal patterns. Both flooded and non-flooded rice fields had lower NEP in 2008 DS (164 and 14 g C m−2, respectively) than in 2008 WS (295 and 82 g C m−2, respectively) because the climate anomaly resulted in SR – driven decrease in GPP. The La Niña in 2009DS even resulted in 0.2 °C lower air temperature and 40% more precipitation than the 2008DS La Niña. This cooler temperature resulted in lower Re in flooded rice fields while the higher precipitation resulted in higher GPP in non-flooded fields since the climate was favorable for the growth of the aerobic rice, the ratoon crops and the weeds. This climate anomaly benefitted both flooded and non-flooded rice fields by increasing NEP (351 and 218 g C m−2, respectively). However, NEP decreased in 2009WS in both flooded and non-flooded rice fields (225 and 39 g C m−2, respectively) due to the devastating effects of the strong tropical cyclones that hit the northern part of the Philippines. On the other hand, the El Niño event during 2010DS resulted in about 6% higher solar radiation, 0.4 °C higher air temperature and 67% lower precipitation than the 28-year climate normal pattern. The NEP of flooded and non-flooded rice fields were closely similar at 187 and 174 g C m−2, respectively. This climate anomaly resulted in Ta – driven increase in Re, as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) – driven decrease in GPP in flooded rice fields.

Tiller production of a ratoon sorghum crop was used as a measure of nonsenescence and this character was quantitatively inherited with additive genetic effects, with no indication of significant dominance genetic effects. The large estimates for additive genetic variation indicated that some progress could be made in selecting for tillers in a ratoon sorghum crop. However, heritability estimates were low (0.18–0.28) for number of tillers in ratooned sorghum. The selection program would probably be most successful if it were based on tiller counts after 6 wk of regrowth.

In Oryza rufipogon, the pattern was also associated with differentiation into annual or perennial ecotypes. These results suggest either that gene flow has been highly restricted between different species, as well as between different ecotypes of O. rufipogon after they were differentiated, or that loci with or without MITEs have been selected in nature together with the linked genes that are responsible for adaptation to environments.

O. glaberrima was characterized by quick accumulation of photosynthate in the panicles. The simple,lf: morphological formation of rachis branching of O. glaberrima is thought to allow the smooth transportation of photosynthate from leaves to chaffs of a panicle and the early maturation. Such a feature as observed in O. glaberrima is regarded as an advantageous character for the seed production in annual plants. The photosynthate partition among different organs was monitored by the C-13 trace method. The culm base of O. sativa accumulated several-fold more C-13 than that of O. glaberrima. The accumulated photosynthate is available as energy resource for initiation of the regenerative growth by ratooning, and the species having a large amount of the accumulation can keep a high potential of growth perenniality.","MAR  1998","2015-06-03 04:50:06","2015-06-03 04:50:06","","315-323","","3-4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000072932500008","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in larvae, pupae and parasitoid populations were monitored continuously on grain sorghum and ratoon crops during 1988-89 and 1989-90 (two growing seasons and a winter). Two peaks of moth flights occurred every year. The first flight, which resulted from the moths emerging from hibernating borers, peaked around the middle of November, and the second flight, usually larger, peaked at the end of February. B. fusca completed two generations on grain sorghum at Cedara. The first generation, which infested the early plants of the ratoon, peaked in the middle of January and the second generation peaked on the crops at the beginning of April. The fluctuation of borer numbers in the crops was synchronized with the instar distribution. An increase in the proportion of young larvae resulted in an increase in larval population, whereas an increase in the proportion of pupae resulted in a decline. Pupal parasitism by Procerochasmias nigromaculatus peaked at 100% during February-March and coincided with a general decline in the population and a high proportion of pupae. Larval parasitoids were active from January to the end of May, peaking at 75% on the ratoon during January. Peaks of larval parasitism usually lagged behind the peaks of larval population and occurred when populations started to decline. The most abundant larval parasitoid was Cotesia sesamiae, which was reared from about 87% of parasitized larvae.","1993","2015-06-03 04:56:00","2015-06-03 08:56:14","","543-553","","6","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199497137800","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are very few reports about the Th. intermedium-derived seed storage protein genes which have been transferred into a wheat background by chromosome manipulation. Our aim is to identify several wheat-Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum derivatives, and document these lines by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), molecular markers and seed storage protein analysis. We found that a novel Th. intermedium 1St#2 chromosome-specific high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) was transferred to the wheat-Thinopyrum derivative lines. The genomic sequence of the Thinopyrum-derived HMW-GS was characterized and designated Glu-1St#2x, since it resembled x-type glutenins in both the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain. It is much shorter than that of reported HMW-GS genes. The Glu-1St#2x sequence was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and resulted in the identical weight to the native protein. The GISH and newly developed chromosome Thinopyrum-specific DNA markers enabled physically location of Glu-1St#2x to the region FL0. 60-1. 00 on Th. intermedium 1St#2L chromosome arm. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Glu-1St#2x evolved earlier than other x-type HMW-GS homoeologues in modern wheat genomes. The effect of Glu-1St#2x on protein content, sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation value and improvement of solvent retention capacity in wheat background suggested that Th. intermedium chromosome 1St#2 may have potential for improvement of wheat end-product quality.","2013","2015-06-03 03:17:22","2015-06-03 20:47:44","","843-853","","4","31","","Mol.

Thirteen feruloylated oligosaccharides were isolated (including eight structures described for the first time) and identified by LC-ESI-MS and NMR. Linkage-type analysis via methylation analysis, as well as the monosaccharide and phenolic acid profiles of the IWG insoluble fiber were also determined.

C.","Kavirondo perennial sorghum an improved type, R2S42.","East African Agricultural Journal","","","","","This is a brief progress report on the breeding and selection for improvement of material derived from a plant found in 1935 near Maseno in the Kavirondo area of Kenya. The plant appeared to have resulted from natural crossing between a cultivated grain sorghum and Sorghum verticilliflorum Stapf, a widely distributed indigenous plant. The unimproved material, in which several clearly different types appear simultaneously, has gained a certain degree of popularity for silage production and aftermath grazing in the drier agricultural regions of both Kenya and Tanganyika over the past six years. Four distinct varieties of the sorghum have been obtained by open selection and have been called "" Black, "" "" Red, "" "" White, "" and "" Mtama-like "" types. In addition attempts have been made to self selected plants from each type. As a result of this latter work, a line which appears to be distinctly superior to the original material has emerged. This is known as "" R2S42 "" which indicates that it is derived from the second red plant self-pollinated in 1942. The chief points in which R2S42 surpasses the original material are that ""it is distinctly more robust and leafy and gives a heavier crop in which the plants attain 9 or 10 feet in height. The inflorescence combines the semi-naked fruits characteristic of the "" Mtama-like "" type with the open panicle of the"" other three types. The appearance of the fruits suggest that the crop might serve the dual purpose of both fodder and grain production."" It is proposed to replace the limited commercial seed supply of the original Kavirondo Perennial Sorghum by the superior R2S42 using the name "" Improved Kavirondo Sorghum"" to distinguish the new type.-G.M.H.","1948","2015-06-03 04:34:06","2015-06-03 09:04:04","","202-202","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19481701257","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined production and senescence of leaf area for six grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) hybrids ranging from 'temperate' to 'tropical'. They were commercial hybrids RS610 and DeKalb E57 +, and four hybrid crosses of 'tropically' adapted lines AT × 623 and RT × 430 and 'temperately' adapted lines AT × 378 and RE × 16-6. All hybrids were grown in the field with adequate moisture and fertility. Leaf areas produced and senesced were measured weekly. Green leaf area index (lai) was defined as lai = lait - lais, where lait was the total lai produced and lais was the lai senesced. Progressions of lait and lais with thermal time after emergence (T = Σ (daily average temperature-8); °C) were described by logistic equations. One coefficient of that form of equation defines the intrinsic rate of exponential increase and the other relates to thermal time to onset of exponential increase. The fitted coefficients were compared among hybrids by analyses of covariance. Intrinsic rates of lai production did not differ significantly among hybrids. However, hybrids had compensating differences in leaf size and distribution of lait between main culms and tillers. Hybrids with a lower percentage of lait on tillers grew larger leaves on main culms. Times to onset of exponential increase in lait differed significantly among hybrids, but were not related to adaptation. Hence, lait during early development was more important than intrinsic production rate for discriminating among hybrids in lai production. Intrinsic rates of senescence differed significantly among hybrids but, although hybrids from the 'temperately' adapted RE×16-6 had lowest senescence rate, difference were not consistently related to adaptation. Percentage of leaves senesced, rather than distribution of senesced lais between main culms and tillers, accounted for senescence differences among hybrids. Hybrid differences in lai duration related closely to differences in lai senescence. Hence, hybrid effects on lai senescence were greater in magnitude than effects on lai production. It is unlikely that differences in leaf area production and senescence account for yield differences between 'temporately' and 'tropically' adapted hybrids. However, knowing the differences among hybrids in leaf area attributes may be useful in crop management and plant breeding.","1987","2015-06-03 04:12:57","2015-06-03 20:43:06","","305-317","","3-4","17","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizers for survival. In recent decades, N fertilizers have been linked to numerous environmental hazards including marine eutrophication, global warming, groundwater contamination, and stratospheric ozone destruction. Some researchers suggest that legumes, which can support biological N2 fixation, offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping systems. This perspective is countered by researchers who argue that, (1) legume-derived N has equally negative environmental impacts as the N derived from synthetic fertilizers, and (2) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural systems that depend on legumes for N inputs. In this review, we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial sources in terms of ecological integrity, energetics and food security. We conclude that obtaining N from legumes is potentially more sustainable than from industrial sources. We further suggest that while some countries are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production, many countries have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of less meat-intensive diets, and reduction of food waste.","2004","2015-06-03 03:19:26","2015-06-03 09:06:08","","279-297","","3","102","","Agric.

Newly developed perennial cereals offer novel systems for addressing these questions. Our study makes a novel contribution by considering how life history differences affect photosynthetic physiology. Methods: In two linked field studies, we evaluated effects of life history and plant age on photosynthetic rates (A), and related biochemical, morphological, and water-relations traits, comparing 1- and 2-yr-old cohorts of perennial wheat, intermediate wheatgrass, and perennial rye to close annual relatives (wheat and rye). Key results: Photosynthetic rates (A) were 10-50% higher in perennial cereals compared to annuals. In wheatgrass, elevated A was associated with higher carboxylation (V-C), triose phosphate utilization (TPU) and electron transport rates (J), and higher leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll. Younger wheatgrass plants maintained higher A, TPU, J, and V-C than older plants did. Perennial wheat and rye differed from annual relatives in some but not all of these parameters. Differences in stomatal limitation were not involved, while differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)) became evident under drier conditions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that some perennial cereal species can maintain higher midseason A than their annual crop relatives. These changes are not fully explainable by increased access to soil water and may reflect trade-offs between allocation to reproduction and to resource acquisition. We also found evidence for age-related changes in photosynthetic physiology in a herbaceous perennial plant.","DEC  2013","2015-06-03 04:34:32","2015-06-03 09:06:43","","2468-2477","","12","100","","Am.

Native prairies in Kansas are relevant in this context, as some have been annually harvested for hay for over 75 years with no fertilization or detectable decline in yield or soil fertility. In contrast, annual crop production has resulted in significant reductions in soil fertility and now requires intensive inputs to maintain yields. Soil food webs were compared between hayed native grasslands and adjacent annual croplands in order to determine the long-term effects of these two production systems on soil ecosystem properties. Soil chemical and physical properties, bacterial and nematode community structure and abundance were measured across five paired sites at six depth intervals to 1 m. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and water stable aggregates were all significantly greater in perennial grasslands than in annual croplands to a depth of 60 cm. Microbial biomass carbon was also greater in grasslands than in croplands, and shifts in δ13C indicated greater input of new carbon at lower depths in grasslands relative to annual croplands. Bacterial and nitrogen fixing communities in croplands and grasslands were significantly different in the surface 40 cm and nematode community differences persisted through 1 m. Nematode community indices suggested enhanced fungal decomposition pathways, fewer plant-feeding nematodes, and greater food web complexity and stability in grassland soils than in annual cropland soils. These data indicate that perennial grasslands in Kansas, even when annually harvested for decades, support higher levels of soil fertility and structure and more complex biological communities than annual cropping systems.","April 15, 2010","2015-06-03 02:26:49","2015-06-03 09:08:29","","13-24","","1–2","137","","Agric.

To sustain soil productivity, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), a leguminous perennial crop was evaluated for its potential as a short duration fallow crop for fodder and grain, and maize (Zea mays) production. It involved comparing a natural fallow (i.e., control) and four improved fallows of pigeon pea pruned annually at 30 cm, 60 cm and 90 cm from the ground, and unpruned pigeon pea over a two-year period. After this time, the land was cleared manually and planted to maize. The highest mean annual biomass of pigeon pea over the two-year period of 6.1 t ha-1 dry matter (DM) was obtained by pruning at 60 cm. The highest leaf litter production and pigeon pea seed yield was obtained from the no pruning treatment. The mean maize grain yield from the improved fallow (3.02 t ha-1) in the first year after clearing was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than that of the natural fallow (1.54 t ha-1). Considering the biomass of pigeon pea from pruning, pigeon pea seed yield and maize grain yield after the pigeon pea, pruning pigeon pea at 60 cm is the most promising regime for crop-livestock production systems.","2002","2015-06-03 05:48:06","2015-06-03 05:48:06","","197-202","","3","54","","Agrofor.

Herbicides were used to control weeds and volunteer sorghum seedlings without killing the primary plants. The selected cultivars displayed some midge resistance, disease resistance, staygreen trait and cold tolerance. The initial harvest was timed to coincide with winter. Advantages of the system include savings in establishment costs, optimum utilization of low rainfall, and protection from soil erosion.

The genetic changes of small populations are tightly associated with their mating pattern, because small populations generally have increased selfing and local inbreeding rates, leading to the effect of genetic drift and loss of genetic variability. Oryza rufipogon Griff, is agriculturally the most important but seriously endangered wild rice species due to rapid decline of population size. To better understand how mating system can be used for species conservation, outcrossing rate, genetic variability at maternal and seedling phases in a small population were examined at seven polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci. Thirty six reproductive individuals and 601 progenies from 20 open-pollinated seed families were measured. The family outcrossing rates varied among plants with an average of 0.318. A high correlation of matings was revealed and about 50% offspring shared the same paternal and maternal genitors, indicating a mixed mating system in the Oryza population. The level of genetic diversity in progeny population was higher than that in maternal population. The maternal population showed significant heterozygote excess, suggesting the selection advantage of heterozygotes. In contrast, significant heterozygote deficit occurred in progeny population, which might have been caused by the increasing of inbreeding in declining population. These results suggest that expanding population size is of significance for in-situ conservation of Oryza rufipogon.","2008","2015-06-03 03:26:31","2015-06-03 03:26:31","","1608-1615","","4","28","","Shengtai Xuebao Acta Ecol.

Castor cake and micrositing caused lower seedling emergence initially, which improved with gap filling. The plant survival was excellent (87%) with micrositing but very poor (10%) with the control at 575 days after sowing. The highest survival and yield with micrositing may be due to the low bulk density (1.15 g/cc) and high plant-available water-holding capacity (112 ram) of the microsite-mixture profile.

(2n = 4x = 28) with blue couch grass Agropyron glaucum (Desf.) Roem. et Schult. [Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski] (2n = 6x = 42), a method has been developed for creation of stable hexaploid intermediate Triticum-Agropyron hybrids (HITAH). These hybrids possess the complete genome complex of durum wheat (AB) and one of the genomes (E) from couch grass. The method incorporates intergeneric crossing, backcrossing with wheat, and one or two self-pollinations. Data are cited on the formative process observed, together with results of cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in subsequent generations. Also presented are data of different authors and our own investigations on the genome structures of couch grass that served as the basis for obtaining HITAH. Especially significant in this regard were investigations of previously created octoploid intermediate Triticum-Agropyron hybrids (perennial and forage grain wheat). The cited data indicate that the mechanism of incorporation of one of the genomes of couch grass (E) into the genome complex of durum wheat (AB) is realized fairly readily due to the fact that this species in genome structure is an incomplete autotetraploid (B2B2E1E1E2E2), and the E genome found in the tetraploid number can therefore be transferred to the chromosome structure of another botanical genus. Analytical crossings of stable HITAH with cultivars of durum, soft, and perennial wheat and cytogenetic analysis of the obtained F1 plants confirmed that HITAH possess ABE genomes, AB from durum wheat and E from blue couch grass.","December 1991","2015-06-03 01:58:45","2015-06-03 01:58:45","","717-728","","6","27","","Soviet genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND92053301&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat); relevant; search.wheat; SPV","chromosome pairing; cytogenetics; Elytrigia intermedia subsp. intermedia; genomics; intergeneric hybridization; meiosis; polyploidy; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typical cultural practices effective at reducing soil- and residue-borne pathogens, such as annual crop rotations, delayed fall planting, and tillage, are not feasible in perennial systems. Consequently, soil- and residue-borne pathogens, and pathogens such as root colonizers and viruses that survive in live tissue, may increase in importance in a perennial grain crop. Resistance genes will undeniably be important defenses against disease. However, it is seldom, if ever, possible to incorporate within a single cultivar resistance to all existing and future important diseases. Furthermore. genes vulnerable to 'boom and bust' cycles are generally short-lived when deployed in monocultures. For these reasons, the use of mixtures of crop cultivars or species that vary in resistance functions will likely be an important strategy for managing diseases and pests of perennial grains. Burning of plant residue, a natural phenomenon in native perennial grass systems, may also be an effective disease management strategy. The successful implementation of these management tools may reduce or eliminate the risk that perennial grain crops will become pathogen refugia that affect neighboring annual plantings and the productivity of perennial plants.","MAR  2005","2015-06-03 04:20:34","2015-06-03 04:20:34","","15-24","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000229467200005","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methane emissions from the microplots were measured over the 77-day first crop and 73-day ratoon crop growing seasons. A closed-chamber technique was used to collect CH4 gas samples in the morning and afternoon hours. Significant urea fertilizer and rice straw effects were observed, and CH4 fluxes were highly variable over the two rice-cropping seasons.

Long-lived trees, shrubs and vines of this form evolved, as did annual herbs. Perennial herb forms with increased allocation to asexual reproduction evolved, but there are no examples of perennial herbs with high sexual effort. We suggest that sowing seed into annually tilled fields favored shorter-lived herbs because of trade-offs between first-year seed production and relative growth rate and/or persistence. By propagating cuttings, people quickly domesticated tuber crops and large woody plants. Perennial herbs were too small to be efficiently propagated by cuttings, and the association between longevity, allogamy and genetic load made rapid domestication by sexual cycles unlikely.

More than 30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions arise from the land use sector. Thus, no strategy for mitigating global climate change can be complete or successful without reducing emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. Moreover, only land-based or ""terrestrial"" carbon sequestration offers the possibility today of large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, through plant photosynthesis. Five major strategies for reducing and sequestering terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions are: • Enriching soil carbon. Soil is the third largest carbon pool on Earth's surface. Agricultural soils can be managed to reduce emissions by minimizing tillage, reducing use of nitrogen fertilizers, and preventing erosion. Soils can store the carbon captured by plants from the atmosphere by building up soil organic matter, which also has benefits for crop production. Adding biochar (biomass burned in a low-oxygen environment) can further enhance carbon storage in soil. • Farming with perennials. Perennial crops, grasses, palms, and trees constantly maintain and develop their root and woody biomass and associated carbon, while providing vegetative cover for soils. There is large potential to substitute annual tilled crops with perennials, particularly for animal feed and vegetable oils, as well as to incorporate woody perennials into annual cropping systems in agroforestry systems. • Climate-friendly livestock production. Rapid growth in demand for livestock products has triggered a huge rise in the number of animals, the concentration of wastes in feedlots and dairies, and the clearing of natural grasslands and forests for grazing. Livestock- related emissions of carbon and methane now account for 14.5 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions-more than the transport sector. A reduction in livestock numbers may be needed but production innovations can help, including rotational grazing systems, manure management, methane capture for biogas production, and improved feeds and feed additives. • Protecting natural habitat. The planet's 4 billion hectares of forests and 5 billion hectares of natural grasslands are a massive reservoir of carbon-both in vegetation above ground and in root systems below ground. As forests and grasslands grow, they remove carbon from the atmosphere. Deforestation, land clearing, and forest and grassland fires are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Incentives are needed to encourage farmers and land users to maintain natural vegetation through product certification, payments for climate services, securing tenure rights, and community fire control. The conservation of natural habitat will benefit biodiversity in the face of climate change. • Restoring degraded watersheds and rangelands. Extensive areas of the world have been denuded of vegetation through land clearing for crops or grazing and from overuse and poor management. Degradation has not only generated a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but local people have lost a valuable livelihood asset as well as essential watershed functions. Restoring vegetative cover on degraded lands can be a win-win-win strategy for addressing climate change, rural poverty, and water scarcity. Agricultural communities can play a central role in fighting climate change. Even at a relatively low price for mitigating carbon emissions, improved land management could offset a quarter of global emissions from fossil fuel use in a year. In contrast, solutions for reducing emissions by carbon capture in the energy sector are unlikely to be widely utilized for decades and do not remove the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. To tackle the climate challenge, we need to pursue land use solutions in addition to efforts to improve energy efficiency and speed the transition to renewable energy. Yet so far, the international science and policy communities have been slow to embrace terrestrial climate action. Some fear that investments in land use will not produce ""real"" climate benefits, or that land use action would distract attention from investment in energy alternatives. There is also a concern that land management changes cannot be implemented quickly enough and at a scale that would make a difference to the climate. But most of these concerns are misplaced or can be addressed effectively now. While many land-use activities are not strictly ""permanent,"" there are numerous ways to ensure that commitments to reduce or offset emissions are strictly met, such as by using large-area programs and investing in reserve areas for insurance. Carbon sequestration through interventions such as agroforestry do not present any ""leakage"" problems, and the risks of leakage from avoided deforestation can be addressed through large-scale monitoring and project screening. Investments to overcome major barriers to farmer adoption of climate-friendly land use systems (such as lack of technical assistance, credit, or planting materials) are clearly ""additional,"" even when the interventions are themselves profitable to land users, and land uses with long-term profitability are far more permanent. Great strides have been made in devising methods for monitoring land-use carbon at field scales for many diverse practices and components of the landscape (soils, grasses, trees, animal wastes, etc.), and methods for integrated landscape-wide carbon assessment will soon be available. While there are institutional challenges to rapidly scaling up climate-friendly practices in diverse rural areas of the world, expertise can be tapped to overcome them-in rural development agencies, farmers' organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private agricultural businesses. Institutional platforms exist in many countries to promote sustainable land management on a large scale. Community land use planning and action models are widely implemented and can be strngthened and adapted to address climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. The food industry is beginning to mobilize investments for climate action in its agricultural supply chains, in response to anticipated consumer demand and regulation. National policies can re-shape public investments and subsidies to support climate-friendly agriculture and land use. Indeed, the benefits for food security, rural livelihoods, and watershed and biodiversity protection that accompany wise, locally appropriate investments in land use will expand political support and new coalitions for climate action generally. They will be an attraction, not a distraction. To tap the full potential of land use mitigation, six principles for action are recommended: 1. Include the full range of terrestrial emission reduction, storage, and sequestration options in climate policy and investment; 2. Incorporate farming and land use investments in cap-and-trade systems; 3. Link terrestrial climate mitigation with adaptation, rural development, and conservation strategies; 4. Encourage large, area-based programs; 5. Encourage voluntary markets for greenhouse gas emission offsets from agriculture and land use; 6.Mobilize a worldwide, networked movement for climate-friendly food, forest, and other land-based production.","2009","2015-06-03 03:18:42","2015-06-03 21:05:46","","1-49","","179","","","Worldwatch Pap.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","action plan; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Animalia; Climate change; emission control; Environmental Monitoring; environmental policy; Food; Greenhouse gas; land management; land use planning; Mitigation; national planning; Poaceae; Profitability; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; soil emission; SPV; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that all four isolated populations carried the genotype (-/-) and (-/+), while three genotypes (-/-), (-/+) and (+/+) was found on the six populations which grown near by rice fields. This finding was strongly supported the idea that the original wild rice populations of O. rufipogon exhibited prominent genotype (-/-) and (-/+) and mainly propagated by vegetative reproduction and the allele (+) which found in the wild rice plant with the genotype (+/+) may originated from gene flow from cultivated rice to wild rice. Weedy rice accessions used in this study showed the three genotypes based on this DNA locus. The distribution of this DNA locus in wild rice and weedy rice populations were deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The perennial wild rice populations were annually under season drought (March to May of the year in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), they tended to have small size clones with relatively high clonal diversity (i.e., number of genotypes), except for the population from Cambodia, which carried only the genotype (-/+).

When inoculated with stripe rust and powdery mildew isolates, CH13-21 displayed novel resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust which inherited from its Thinopyrum parent.

The molecular markers analysis further confirmed that the introduced Th. intermedium chromatin in CH13-21 belonged to the long arm of homoeologous group 6 chromosome.

However, recent research has demonstrated that the Australian AA genome perennial populations have maternal genomes more closely related to those of O. meridionalis than to those found in Asian populations of O. rufipogon suggesting that the Australian perennials may represent a new distinct gene pool for rice. Results: Analysis of an Oryza core collection covering AA genome species from Asia to Oceania revealed that some Oceania perennials had organellar genomes closely related to that of O meridionalis (meridionalis-type). O. rufipogon accessions from New Guinea carried either the meridionalis-type or rufirpogon-type (like O. rufipogon) organellar genomes. Australian perennials carried only the meridionalis-type organellar genomes when accompanied by the rufipogon-type nuclear genome. New accessions were collected to better characterize the Australian perennials, and their life histories (annual or perennial) were confirmed by field observations. All of the material collected carried only meridionalis-type organellar genomes. However, there were two distinct perennial groups. One of them carried an rufipogon-type nuclear genome similar to the Australian O. rufipogon in the core collection and the other carried an meridionalis-type nuclear genome not represented in the existing collection. Morphologically the rufipogon-type shared similarity with Asian O. rufipogon. The meridionalis-type showed some similarities to O. meridionalis such as the short anthers usually characteristic of annual populations. However, the meridionalis-type perennial was readily distinguished from O. meridionalis by the presence of a larger lemma and higher number of spikelets. Conclusion: Analysis of current accessions clearly indicated that there are two distinct types of Australian perennials. Both of them differed genetically from Asian O. rufipogon. One lineage is closely related to O. meridionalis and another to Asian O. rufipogon. The first was presumed to have evolved by divergence from O. meridionalis becoming differentiated as a perennial species in Australia indicating that it represents a new gene pool. The second, apparently derived from Asian O. rufipogon, possibly arrived in Australia later.","2013","2015-06-03 04:22:48","2015-06-03 09:21:23","","26","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000329808100003","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Annual; Australia; Genetic divergence; Oryza; Oryza meridionalis; Oryza rufipogon; Perennial; relevant; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science; Zizania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such information, however, has not been available for the Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) despite its importance as a staple food and a model organism. To reveal levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity and to elucidate the genetic relationship and demographic history of O. sativa and its close relatives (Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara), we investigated nucleotide diversity data from 10 unlinked nuclear loci in species-wide samples of these species. The results indicated that O. rufipogon and O. nivara possessed comparable levels of nucleotide variation (θ sil = 0.0077∼0.0095) compared with the relatives of other crops. In contrast, nucleotide diversity of O. sativa was as low as θ sil = 0.0024 and even lower (θ sil = 0.0021 for indica and 0.0011 for japonica), if we consider the 2 subspecies separately. Overall, only 20-10% of the diversity in the wild species was retained in 2 subspecies of the cultivated rice (indica and japonica), respectively. Because statistic tests did not reject the assumption of neutrality for all 10 loci, we further used coalescent to simulate bottlenecks under various lengths and population sizes to better understand the domestication process. Consistent with the dramatic reduction in nucleotide diversity, we detected a severe domestication bottleneck and demonstrated that the sequence diversity currently found in the rice genome could be explained by a founding population of 1,500 individuals if the initial domestication event occurred over a 3,000-year period. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close genetic relationships and ambiguous species boundary of O. rufipogon and O. nivara, providing additional evidence to treat them as 2 ecotypes of a single species. Lowest linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found in the perennial O. rufipogon where the r 2 value dropped to a negligible level within 400 bp, and the highest in the japonica rice where LD extended to the entirely sequenced region (∼900 bp), implying that LD mapping by genome scans may not be feasible in wild rice due to the high density of markers needed.","2007","2015-06-03 03:26:45","2015-06-03 20:25:27","","875-888","","3","24","","Mol.

Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essentials for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature’s ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans can now build an agriculture based on nature’s ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture.","February 2002","2015-06-03 02:28:13","2015-06-03 09:23:00","","111-117","","2","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND23301705+&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; Agriculture; full text added; Nature; perennial N1 grain; perennial W/1 grain; Polyculture; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.grain; SPV; Sustainable; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","agriculture; agrochemicals; alternative farming; disease control; domestication; ecology; ecosystems; evolution; insect pests; literature reviews; perennials; pest management; petroleum; plant pathogens; seed productivity; soil erosion; soil pollution; weed control; weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K.","Neighborhood effects on growth, seed yield, and weed biomass for three perennial grains in polyculture.","Journal of Sustainable Agriculture","","1044-0046","10.1300/J064v04n02_04","","Patterns of growth and seed/grain yield of three perennial crops (wildrye, Leymus racemosus; eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides; and Illinois bundleflower, Desmanthus illinoensis) were examined in a pilot mixed cropping system at Salina, Kansas in 1987-89 to quantify interspecific interactions and effects on weed growth. Rows were composed of alternating strips of 4 plants of each species, which were staggered such that adjacent rows had plants of different species. The suggested advantages of growing a mixture of perennial grasses and legumes were the provision of continuous cover to eliminate soil erosion, a build-up of organic matter, the supply of N from the legume, and a reduction in the necessity of chemical inputs for weed and disease control. Wildrye flowers and fruits in late spring, eastern gamagrass in mid-summer, and Illinois bundleflower during late summer. Wildrye grain has historically been used as a human food, particularly in drought years, while it is suggested that eastern gamagrass and Illinois bundleflower also have potential as human seed/grain crops. The legume, Illinois bundleflower, produced its highest seed yield (147 g m -2) in the first year; wildrye (33.4 g m -2) and gamagrass (73.3 g m -2) yields were highest in the second and third years. Seed/grain yields, ripening, plant size, and effects on weeds were variable, depending on neighbouring species. In some years both wildrye and bundleflower had highest yields when adjacent plants within the row were wildrye whereas gamagrass yielded best if next to bundleflower. The ripening rate of bundleflower was particularly sensitive to neighbouring species. In general, gamagrass performed better with neighbouring plants of a different species. Variability of wildrye grain yield was consistently 20-40% higher among plants adjacent to gamagrass. Weed biomass tended to be lower between rows of the two grasses than between rows of either grass and bundleflower. The study showed that the three species appeared to be compatible and were fairly complementary in space and time. Because of species-specific neighbourhood effects on phenology, growth, and seed/grain yield, interactions between particular components need to be considered when designing crop mixtures that incorporate dissimilar species.","1994","2015-06-03 04:21:03","2015-08-31 16:51:00","","11-31","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19940709032","","","","relevant; search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, intermediate wheatgrass is currently being domesticated as a perennial grain crop. However, the genetic information for molecular breeding is quite limited. Here we report a molecular analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in intermediate wheatgrass using gene cloning and protein biochemistry. Five HMW-GS genes were isolated from individual intermediate wheatgrass plants: two x-type genes TiHGS1 and TiHGS4, and three y-type genes TiHGS2, TiHGS3 and TiHGS5. Among them, TiHGS5 was novel and possessed an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminal domain or repetitive domain. Sequence alignments showed that TiHGS1 and TiHGS2 genes shared high identities (>96%) with the Glu-1Dx and Glu-1Dy genes, respectively, in common wheat and Aegilops species, TiHGS3 with HMW-GS genes from Dasypyrum or Pseudoroegneria, and TiHGS4 and TiHGS5 with HMW-GS genes from Thinopyrum elongatum.

The same principle can be applied to producing hardy varieties for the north, since cold resistance is very much correlated with the first developmental stage. A great advance in the direction of relieving the pressure at the beginning of harvest is afforded by the new perennial cereals produced by crossing with Agropyrum, perennial rye, etc., some of which in their second and later years mature much earlier than any other cereals, even winter rye, and can be harvested before the real pressure begins.

By integrating N fixing trees in the coconut-based mixed cropping system, the use of chemical fertilizers could be minimized. Reduction in the use of nitrogenous fertilizers controls the emission of nitrous oxide which has ~300 times the warming capacity of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. The tree species introduced in the system will also assimilate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the tree biomass and soil. In this way, the N fixing tree population in the system contributes to climate change mitigation besides supporting important ecosystem services. Although N fixation is impeded in fertile soils, the trees could still perform protective functions benefiting the system as a whole.","2010","2015-06-03 04:17:11","2015-06-03 04:17:11","","2-6","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20103287549","","","","relevant; search.pigeonpea; SPV; TS=((""long duration"" OR perennial) NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","Notes on work on the crossing of Agropyron species with wheat.","Vestnik Gibridizatsii","","","","","The following species of Agropyron were crossed at the Bezencuk breeding station with Triticum durum, T. persicum, T. Timopheevi and T. polonicum and the soft wheats: A. intermedium, A. trichophorum, A. obtusiuscum [sic] and A. elongatum. The soft wheats were autumn forms and the hard, mainly spring forms. With all the species of Agropyron the highest percentage set was obtained from the crosses with the soft varieties and the lowest percentage in the crosses involving T. persicum. Of the Agropyron species, A. glaucum gave the lowest set when crossed with the wheats, and A. elongatum the highest. On back-crossing the hybrids from soft and hard wheats crossed with A. intermedium, to counteract the F 1sterility, the best set was obtained with soft wheat pollen, i.e. from 1.5 to 6.1%, while the corresponding figures for the hard wheats were 0.2 to 0.9%. Under the conditions at the station all Agropyron species (except the local ones) comprised winter, semi-winter and spring forms. The local types and A. elongatum were very winter-hardy and the latter species had the longest vernalization stage. The Agropyron species varied in the length of the second stage. The F 1 intergeneric hybrids were perennial forms of marked vigour. The F 1 from the crosses between autumn wheats and the local Agropyron were the most winter hardy, while the F 1 hybrids from the combination of autumn wheats with A. glaucum were the least so, the percentage that survived the winter being 65.8% for the former and 29.2% for the latter. Figures for the F 3 and F 4 generations show that, with few exceptions, crosses between spring wheats and the various Agropyron species used did not produce winter hardy forms. In 1940, 57 of the best F 4 strains superior to the standard Lutescens 1060/10 in various economic features were sown in the nursery. Some of them were perennial and showed high tillering capacity and a cultivated type of ear and grain and good threshing qualities, as well as being resistant to fungous diseases. In addition, 158 superior clones were chosen for their potential value in the breeding of perennial wheats. Hybrids between wheats and local Agropyron forms deserve attention for their drought resistance.","1941","2015-06-03 04:45:26","2015-06-03 04:45:26","","99-100","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19441601199","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The estimated nucleotide diversity in the Adh1 locus region of O. rufipogon was 0.002, which was one of the lowest values detected in nuclear loci of plant species investigated so far. Tests of neutrality detected significantly negative deviation from the neutral mutation model for the coding region, especially for replacement sites. When each of the ADH1 domains was considered, significance was detected only for the catalytic domain 1. These results suggest purifying selection in the Adh1 coding region. In the phylogenetic tree of Oryza species based on Adh1 variation, cultivated rice O. sativa sub-spp. japonica and indica were included in the cluster of O. rufipogon. The genetic distance of the Adh1 region between O. rufipogon and O. sativa was as low as the nucleotide diversity of O. rufipogon. These results imply that O. rufipogon and O. sativa cannot be classified based on the nucleotide variation of Adh1. No replacement divergence between O. rufipogon and the other three A-genome species (O. glumaepatula, O. barthii and O. meridionalis) were detected, indicating that ADH1 is conserved in the A-genome species. On the other hand, between O. rufipogon and the E-genome species O. australiensis, replacement changes were detected only in the catalytic domain 1. The difference in replacement substitutions between the A- and E-genome species may be related to adaptive changes in the ADH1 domains, reflecting environmental differences where the species encounter anaerobic stress.","2004","2015-06-03 03:27:00","2015-06-03 20:27:28","","1406-1416","","7","109","","Theor.

In response to requests from farmers, the winter wheat breeding program at Washington State University has been developing perennial wheat selected from crosses between wild wheatgrass species and commonly grown annual wheat cultivars. In 2005/06, we conducted field trials of the most promising perennial wheat breeding lines derived from interspecific crosses between tall wheatgrass ( Thinopyrum elongatum) and bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum). Thirty-one perennial breeding lines and two annual winter wheat cultivars were evaluated for nutritional value in the form of grain mineral concentration, multiple baking and milling quality traits, and ease of grain threshability. The objective of this study was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these post-harvest traits in the perennial wheat lines derived from these interspecific crosses. Mineral nutrient concentrations in the perennial lines were 44, 40, 24, 23, 32, 30 and 33% higher than the annual control cultivars for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and zinc, respectively. The annual cultivars had a higher grain mineral content per unit area of land than the perennial lines, due primarily to the higher grain yields of the annual cultivars. Compared to the annual wheat cultivars, the perennial lines produced grain with smaller seed size, lower test weight and reduced flour yield, mix time and loaf volume. Protein content was 3.5-4.5% higher in the perennial lines than in the annual cultivars. The threshability index (TI) ranged from 0.63 to 0.89 in the perennials (=0.75); significantly lower than the mean TI of the annual cultivars (=0.97). The significant genotype * location interaction found for TI suggests that the variation in annual precipitation positively influenced some perennial lines to express greater threshability. In addition to transferring traits important to the perennial growth habit in wheat, the wild wheatgrass species also introduced beneficial characteristics (i.e. increased protein and mineral concentration) and deleterious traits (poor threshing grain and inferior baking qualities). This research gives researchers a platform from which to direct further research and selection in the development of perennial wheat.","DEC  2009","2015-06-03 04:40:31","2015-06-03 09:28:27","","285-292","","4","24","","Renew.

M.","On the ways towards perennial wheat.","Sotsialisticheskoe Zernovoe Khozyaistvo","","","","","Reference is made to the numerous useful qualities in the three species of Agropyrum that cross with wheat and which it would be desirable to introduce into wheat, for instance resistance to drought, cold, salty soil and various diseases, vigourous growth and lastly the perennial habit. The success of crossing depends very largely on the choice of parental strains, the success in different combinations varying from 7-10 to 90 or more per cent. The fertility of the F 1 hybrids also varies, being highest in some combinations of Triticum vulgare x A. elongatum. Thus as many as 3000 grains were obtained from seven plants of the wheat Sarrosa x A. elongatum, whilst from another T. vulgare with the same species of Agropyrum only 14, 000 grains were obtained from 2000 plants. Even different plants in the same F 1 vary in fertility. Great variations in fertility, as well as in all other characters, occur in the later generations. These, mainly obtained by back-crossing with wheat in the crosses with A. trichophorum and A. intermedium, contain less and less perennial forms, though the expression of this character varies with growth conditions, being more pronounced in the greenhouse than in the field. The later generations of the cross with A, elongatum, being largely obtained by selfing, contain many more perennial forms, sometimes up to 90 per cent, and in other ways more nearly resemble the Agropyrum parent. One constant perennial line was isolated from this cross in 1934 and is described and illustrated. It has an ear intermediate in type and small grain of the wheat type. Thus the possibility of obtaining true-breeding perennial lines from the cross has been demonstrated and it only remains now to isolate a form of higher quality. Many of the annual forms are also of exceptional interest for breeding, being distinguished by productivity, good vitreous grain, and complete resistance to rust and smut and this part of the problem can definitely be said to have been achieved. The high degree of pairing in the hybrids, where up to 21 bivalents have been observed, indicates the close relationship between the two genera. This supports the hope that the desired combinations will be attained, and suggests that the genus Agropyrum may contain the ancestors of the genus Triticum, in which case such crosses as these gain enormously in importance.","1935","2015-06-03 04:46:02","2015-06-03 04:46:02","","77-83","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19361600832","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technologies must be effective within farmer resource constraints, increase food production, reduce risk and enhance the soil fertility. Results from on-farm participatory research were used to quantify the effects of agronomic practices on soil resources. Agricultural productivity is primarily nitrogen (N) limited throughout Malawi, and sub-humid Zimbabwe. Tightening economic constraints faced by farmers in the region have reduced inorganic fertilizer inputs and necessitate increased reliance on biologically-fixed N and N cycling. Three components of organic matter technology were evaluated: (1) the effects of residue quality; (2) the role of deep rooting systems; and (3) tradeoffs between legumes grown for grain versus soil regeneration. Perennial systems investigated include improved fallows, intercropping, and biomass transfer. Annual systems include intercrops and rotations of cereals with legumes. The most promising non-food legumes were Tephrosia and Sesbania. Interestingly, high quality residues of perennial legumes were most effective at supplying N in the short to medium term, whereas low quality residues immobilised N. Low quality residues were problematic for smallholder farmers who need immediately available N. Challenges to adoption of perennial system technologies include establishment costs, resource competition and delayed benefits. Farmer adoption of annual grain legumes is promoted by the simultaneous production of food; however, those species which have a high N harvest index add little to no net N to the soil. Species that combine some grain yield with high root and leaf biomass, thus a low N harvest offer a useful compromise of meeting farmer food security concerns and improving soil fertility. Promising genotypes include Arachis, Cajanus, Dolichos and Mucuna spp. On-farm N budgets indicate that legumes with high quality residues and deep root systems are effective ways at improving nutrient cycling. Areas of future research priority for smallholder farms in southern Africa were identified, including technologies which combine inorganic and organic fertilizer and improve legume growth and establishment on degraded soils.","December 1, 1998","2015-06-03 02:28:09","2015-06-04 12:04:04","","185-200","","1–3","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroforestry; full text added; Grain legumes; perennial W/1 grain; relevant; Residue quality; ScienceDirect; search.grain; Soil fertility; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2- and 3-leaf-stage tillers, the first leaf was preferred; in 4-leaf-stage tillers, the second leaf; in 5-leaf-stage tillers, the third leaf; in 6-leaf-stage tillers, the fourth leaf; and in 7-leaf-stage tillers, the third and fourth leaves were preferred for oviposition.

It is a vital gene source for rice breeding programs. Many populations of the species, unfortunately, have drastically diminished because of the disappearance of aquatic habitats as a result of human disturbance. In order to determine patterns of genetic variation at two stages of the life-cycle in the wild rice species, we investigated allozyme variation of four natural populations in China. Two southern populations have significant asexual reproduction while two other northern marginal populations show a mixed reproduction in China. At 22 allozyme loci, a significantly lower genetic diversity was observed in the ratoons than in the seeds of the two southern populations, whereas a significantly higher genetic diversity was found in the ratoons than in the seeds of the two northern marginal populations. The results suggest that the variation of reproductive system is probably associated with their patterns of genetic variation in the species. Moreover, a significantly higher genetic differentiation among populations found in the ratoons than in the seeds may stem from pollen-mediated gene flow among them. Finally, we propose suggestions for conservation management of the endangered species.","2005","2015-06-03 03:26:54","2015-06-03 20:41:40","","2821-2834","","12","14","","Biodiversity Conserv.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","allozyme; Allozyme analysis; ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Asia; China; conservation genetics; Conservation implications; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; genetic diversity; Genetic variation; life history; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza rufipogon Griff.; Population genetic structure; relevant; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; World; Zizania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to assess their capacity to regrow post-harvest and yield grain over successive years, and thereby identify characteristics common to the surviving breeding lines. Over the 3-year experimental period 61% of the 176 experimental entries demonstrated some capacity for post-harvest regrowth. Of 125 entries planted in the first two years of experimentation, 34% persisted to produce a second grain harvest in year 2. Three entries from 73 planted in 2008 persisted to produce grain in 3 successive years. In a subset of 87 entries that underwent cytogenetic analysis there was an association between regrowth ability and the presence of at least one whole genome equivalent (14 chromosomes) from the perennial donor species. If the wheat parent was a hexaploid (2n = 42), an entry required at least 56 chromosomes to achieve any substantial post-harvest regrowth. However, the presence of 56 chromosomes was no guarantee of a capacity to survive post-harvest. The morphology of the hybrid germplasm was highly variable for every trait assessed including grain yield, grain size, grain quality, harvest index, tiller height and head morphology; reflective of the diversity of pedigrees. Narrower kernels appeared to be associated with higher grain protein concentrations. Unextractable polymeric protein (UPP) correlates with rheological properties of the doughs; some of the experimental entries had very low UPP; the majority had high UPP suggesting useful flour, dough and baking properties. A high level of disease resistance was observed in the subset of entries tested for leaf, stem and stripe rust as well as wheat streak mosaic virus, indicating that further development of hybrid germplasm would be unlikely to pose an unacceptable disease threat to conventional cereal crops, particularly where amphiploids were deployed. The variability of the cohort and the presence of entries with desirable agronomic and grain quality attributes suggested a potential to breed and select for perennial wheat derivatives with commercially desirable characteristics.","July 11, 2012","2015-06-03 02:26:31","2015-06-03 09:35:22","","68-89","","0","133","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44676013&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); biochemical composition; Cereal; Crop yield; cultivar; cytogenetics; experimental study; Food quality; full text added; genome; germplasm; harvesting; Intermediate wheatgrass; Lophopyrum elongatum; Morphology; perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat); perennial plant; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Perennial wheat; Protein; Regrowth; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; selective breeding; SPV; Tall wheatgrass; Thinopyrum elongatum; Thinopyrum intermedium; Thinopyrum ponticum; Triticum aestivum; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science; Wheat streak mosaic virus","breeding lines; chromosomes; cytogenetic analysis; disease resistance; dough; field experimentation; flour; genome; germplasm; grain crops; grain protein; grain yield; harvest index; harvesting; hybrids; leaves; parents; pedigree; proteins; regrowth; rheological properties; seeds; stem rust; tillers; wheat; Wheat streak mosaic virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first Canadian cultivar of this crop (AC E-1), tested as LRC 96-1, was released in 2001 to a seed company for multiplication and distribution. Seed for commercial forage production is expected to be available in 2003. AC E-1 will have the distinction of being the first North American cultivar of PC Rye and the only perennial cereal crop specifically developed for forage production. PC Rye was originally developed in Germany by crossing Rye ( Secale cereale) with a Perennial Wild Rye ( Secale montanum). AC E-1 PC Rye has survived and produced economic amounts of biomass for four years under southern Alberta growing conditions. It has the ability to produce an amount and quality of silage similar to barley, which is grown extensively in the Canadian prairies for the purpose. Grazing studies with AC E-1 have shown that the crop can be used for grazing during its early stages of growth with good results. However, it produces less seed than the fall rye cultivars grown in the area and the seed heads are susceptible to ergot infection. Its poor seed yield and susceptibility to ergot may be due to a high proportion of sterile seed heads, the main drawback of this cultivar. Although ergot susceptibility is not a major concern for a silage crop, research at Lethbridge is directed towards improving seed head fertility of this crop, which will have a positive impact on its seed yield. This review deals with the historical background of this crop, present status, and our efforts to improve it.","2001","2015-06-03 04:35:22","2015-06-03 04:35:22","","13-19","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20013167250","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S.","Perennial grain crops: A synthesis of ecology and plant breeding","Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems","","1742-1705","10.1079/RAF200496","","Perennial grain crops would address many agricultural problems, including soil erosion, nutrient loss and pesticide contamination. Doubts about the possibility of perennial grain crops rest upon two assumptions: (1) that the relationship between yield and longevity is a fixed function that cannot be influenced by selection, mutation or environmental changes; and (2) that yield and longevity trade off in a bivariate manner to the exclusion of all other traits. These assumptions are consistent with the phenotypic trade-off model, but recent research suggests that a quantitative genetic model is a more appropriate approach to trade-offs. In the quantitative genetic model, environmental and genetic changes can result in increases in two traits simultaneously even when a trade-off, or negative correlation, exists between the two traits. Empirical evidence that the trade-off between perenniality and reproductive allocation is not fixed comes from wild, herbaceous perennials that can produce more than 2000 kg seed ha(-1) in the temperate zone, and herbaceous perennial crops that produce on average 8900 kg fruit ha(-1) in the tropics. Ecological literature suggests that most perennials produce small amounts of seed relative to their vegetative growth not as a physiological absolute, but rather as a result of natural selection in a stable, competitive environment favoring longevity. By selecting strongly for seed yield in a population of perennial plants, the plant breeder can likely achieve that which is rare in nature-a high seed-yielding perennial plant. The same general methodologies that have allowed annual grain breeders to increase grain yield and push many combinations of negatively correlated traits to levels of expression not seen in nature are available to the perennial grain breeder. Perennial,rain breeders are integrating ecological principles and traditional plant breeding methods in their efforts to develop perennial grain wheat (Triticum spp.), sorghum (Sorghum spp.), sunflower (Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) and rice (Oryza spp.).","MAR  2005","2015-06-03 04:20:33","2015-06-03 09:36:23","","5-14","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000229467200004","","","","relevant; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, efforts to develop perennial grain crops which were initiated during the 20th century are discussed. These include attempts by the Soviets and Europeans to perennialize annual grains such as wheat and rye. More recently, efforts in the U.S. inspired by the publication of Dr. Wes Jackson's book, New Roots for Agriculture,1,2 have focused upon the domestication of perennial grass species.

Given the proper conditions, these crops can produce spectacular yields and good profits. Annual crops, however, are not necessarily the best choice for all situations, especially on highly erodible or marginal land. Soil erosion and other environmental problems associated with annual crop production currently are managed with such practices as contouring, terracing, conservation tillage, wind erosion reduction methods (2), and land set-asides. Although these practices may control soil erosion, they may be undesirable for other reasons. For example, conservation tillage tends to depend heavily on agricultural chemicals that may leach into groundwater supplies. Development of perennial grain crops could provide farmers with an alternative that reduces soil erosion and improves environmental aspects of crop production. The concept of producing grain from well-adapted, herbaceous perennials was first presented by Wes Jackson in his book New Roots for Agriculture (3). Grain production from perennial grasses could provide an important alternative use for land that cannot sustain annual crop production. The advantages that perennial grains have over annuals include year-round soil protection as well as lower annual inputs of labor and materials.

Recent statistics show that an additional 40 million hectares of rice paddy is needed to increase rice production to 118 million tons by 2035, a figure that is more than double the current rice production. Every year, rice is planted in approximately 14 million hectares of upland areas. Current benchmark yields of annual upland rice are lower than 1 t/ha. If upland rice yield can be increased to 3-4 t/ha, a reasonable yield under barren and infertile soil conditions, 40 Mt of rice can easily be secured. Traditionally, the uplands suffer from drought, infertile soils, weed infestation and plant diseases. Compounding these problems is the continuous erosion and degradation of upland soils due to agricultural use. A practical solution to these problems would be to breed and cultivate perennial upland rice that would not have to be planted annually. Not only would perennial upland rice reduce soil erosion by providing permanent groundcover. It would also improve the sustainability of the uplands for agricultural use and lower the annual inputs related to field operations, thus increasing the income of farmers.","2012","2015-06-03 04:22:54","2015-06-03 04:22:54","","191-201","","2","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20133031489","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This sp. is widely distributed over the Egyptian Sudan, Tanganyika, the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, and French Guinea. It multiplies by seed, rhizomes, and short pieces of culms. Its persistence in nature is due mainly to reproduction by rhizomes, which are drought-resistant and resume growth with the first rain after the 7-mo's. dry season; 4 or 5 generations of tillers may come from one rhizome. The distribution of the species is controlled largely by the duration of soil inundation; it is absent from areas continuously under water. It is somewhat salt-tolerant, being found in soils with a content of NaCl up to 840 ppm. The potential economic uses of O. barthii are varied; the foliage is excellent for green forage, and suitable as hay for cattle and sheep. The straw can be used in the manufacture of paper. The grain is excellent for human consumption and has the desirable feature of a white pericarp.

Then, agricultural crops with newly designed characters or even absolutely new crop species particularly with low demands for cultivation, water supply, fertilizer or other agrochemicals (low-input varieties) could be very helpful. For that a project of breeding “perennial rye” (Secale cereale × Secale montanum), for different farming systems respectively, is presented which has already been performed in some details and which could surely be realized in total if only a small part of the means were invested in this project as for example were spent into the development of Triticale as a new crop plant. Because of its high tolerance to poor sandy soils and water stress a perennial green forage rye may also be expected to be well suited in a spring rye variant for the improvement of dry pastures in the subtropical countries.

I.","Perennial varieties of cultivated plants.","Novoe v Sel'skom Khozyaistve","","","","","The advantages of the perennial types which are found in related species of so many of the main crop plants are enumerated, these being largely associated with their greater vigour and yield, hardiness, disease and drought resistance and their considerably earlier maturity in the second and later years of vegetation; it is thus often possible to get more than one crop per year. In crossing wheat with perennial rye the best results have been obtained with ryes from Armenia-the hybrids from these forms were more fertile and gave a more fertile back-cross progeny than any others; this is ascribed to the fact that these forms have for thousands of years been growing in similar climatic conditions to the wheats, as a result of which ""their chromatin has become more similar"", owing to natural selection of a similar ecological type. Wheat is also being crossed extensively with Agropyrum and with perennial rye. Of the latter over 200 different parental combinations have been made, in which an average success of 70 per cent was observed. The most successful of all the combinations was leucurum 1364/1 x Secale moniamtm (Kat. 8) from Armenia which cross was made in 1933 and has now produced a fertile perennial T. durum, in which the yield and grain weight were superior to those of the standard varieties but the ear is unfortunately brittle. Hybrids of this form with standard wheat varieties have a tough rachis and it is thought probable that perennial tough forms will be obtained in the second or third generation. The hybrids are resistant to brown rust and quite immune to stem and yellow rust. New stems are formed after harvest and in 1936 these attained a height of 40-50 cm. and were cut for hay, and in 10-15 of the hybrids they produced a second crop of grain 50-60 per cent the size of the first, 15 to 24 grains being produced per ear, with a. 1, 000-corn weight of 35 grm. By suitable cultural treatments this second yield could be brought up to that of the first. Similar crosses are being made between perennial and cultivated rye, sunflower with Helianthus maximiliani and H. rigidus and cultivated sorghum with S. halepense and several perennial leguminous species are being crossed with the allied cultivated forms.","1937","2015-06-03 04:39:35","2015-06-03 09:38:02","","44 pp.-44 pp.","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19381601132","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are also potential direct production benefits from reduced external inputs, providing extra grazing for livestock in mixed farming systems, as well as benefits for whole-farm management which may offset lower grain yields. In addition to universal issues of domestication and breeding of perennial wheat, specific challenges for perennial wheat in Australia's dryland systems will include tolerance of water deficit and poor soil environments, and the risks of hosting foliar pathogens over summer. Temperate perennial forage grasses could indicate the potential distribution and traits required in perennial wheat adapted to more arid environments (e.g. summer dormancy). Several Australian native and exotic perennial relatives of wheat could also provide sources of disease resistance, and tolerance of soil acidity, drought, salinity and waterlogging. Still, several farming systems could accommodate perennial wheat with inconsistent persistence in some environments. While developing perennial wheat will be challenging, there is significant opportunity in Australia for perennial wheat to diversify current cropping options. The risks may be minimised by staged investment and interim products with some immediate applications could be produced along the way.","2010","2015-06-03 04:40:28","2015-06-03 09:38:19","","679-690","","9","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000281628100001","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44422316&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat); relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","arid lands; Australia; carbon; disease resistance; domestication; dormancy; drought; edaphic factors; farming systems; flooded conditions; forage grasses; grain yield; mixed grazing; pathogens; production technology; risk; salinity; soil erosion; soil pH; soil quality; soil water deficit; summer; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using classical breeding methods, new types of wheat have been developed that maintain the key characteristics of annual wheat, but continue to grow after harvest. Following dormancy in the winter, growth is initiated from the roots or crowns in the spring, allowing a crop to be harvested every fall. By retaining constant soil cover over multiple years, wind and water erosion would be dramatically reduced. In addition, the costs associated with annual seeding and tillage would be minimized, and unlike many reduced tillage systems, it is expected that standard seeding equipment would be suitable for stand establishment. Other potential benefits of perennial wheat include improved wildlife habitat, more efficient use of available water, provision of a potent carbon sink, and the possibility of integrating straw retrieval into a small grains cropping system. Past attempts in the first half of the last century failed to develop perennial wheat as a viable crop, primarily because of low yields, and the research was ultimately abandoned. Perrennial wheat production may now be viewed as acceptable for highly erodible land or for obtaining carbon sequestration credits. This paper presents an overview of solutions to the obstacles encountered by previous researchers, introduces some of the newly developed perennial wheat lines, and discusses considerations for management practices.","2001","2015-06-03 03:19:42","2015-06-03 09:38:59","","147-151","","4","16","","Am.

The ratoon crop of IR2058-78-1-3-2-3, IR2863-38-1-2, IR4722-36-1 and IR2823-399-5-6 with respective overall yields of 2.57, 2.33, 2.09 and 1.92 t/ha and respective maturities of 79, 74, 79 and 68 days after main crop harvest looked very promising. Under abundant water supply condition IR2058-78-1-3-2-3, IR2863-38-1-2 and IR4722-36-1 ratoons yielded 3 t/ha or more and just as good or even better than the main crop mainly due to better water supply which enhanced ratoon tillering or the 5 most suitable ratoon selections yielded an average of over 90% that of the main crop. In the bunds with moderate and limited water supply, iron deficiency adversely affected ratoon performance moderately and severely, respectively. None of the ratoons lodged due to the frequent occurrence of extremely strong typhoons. The potentials of continuous ratooning (twice) appeared encouraging with very good water supply based on the performance of two early maturing varieties. The second ratoon had much higher yields and better grain characteristics than those of the first ratoon thus best demonstrating the feasibility of having a good ratoon only under adequate or abundant water supply condition where favorable crop nutritional factors apparently exist Also, the presence of a high proportion of basal tillers might have somehow contributed to better anchorage and non-lodging tendency of the ratoons particularly under abundant water supply condition. The superior yielding selections found highly suitable both for dry-seeding and ratooning purposes generally exhibited such agronomic traits as being medium late maturing, relatively short statured, very high in tillering and panicle producing abilities, slightly lodging or non-lodging, average-sized in panicles and grains and having a high degree of tolerance to drought and iron deficiency. A ratoon crop appeared to have several advantages over a succeeding newly-established transplanted crop such as the elimination of the turn-around period and transplanting material and labour inputs, much reduced fertilizer input, extra-ordinary lodging resistance and much shortened growth duration.","1979","2015-06-03 04:54:27","2015-06-03 04:54:27","","95-101","","2/3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093019620","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench] in the field. In efforts to build simulation models of ratoon grain sorghum, modellers have assumed that the planted and ratoon crops grow similarily. This study was undertaken to document the growth of ratoon grain sorghum and test the hypothesis that growth and development of the ratoon crop is similar to the planted crop. Experiments were conducted from 1985 through 1987 under irrigated field conditions using nine hybrids of medium/medium-late maturity on a Houston Black clay: fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellustert. In two of the three years, grain-yield of the planted crop exceeded the ratoon while grain-yield was equal in the other year studied. Rapid development of tillers produced much higher leaf-area indexes (L) and vegetative biomass early in the plant's ontogeny for the ratoon compared to the planted crop. Depending on hybrid and year, each primary shoot (PS) of the planted crop produced from 4 to 7 tillers within 20 days of harvest of the planted crop. At harvest, however, only 2–3 tillers/PS remained and only 1.7 tillers/PS (on average) produced grain. The planted crop allocated a higher proportion of its total above-ground biomass to grain than did the ratoon crop. Differences in the degree of tillering and partitioning of biomass to grain were found among hybrids. Yet, a significant hybrid×year interaction suggests that partitioning was dependent on the environment. Phenology of planted and ratoon crops were similar. Grain-forming tillers produced the same number of leaves as the primary shoot of the planted crop, and differences in time to anthesis between the planted and ratoon crops averaged approximately 100 of the 1000 heat units (7°C base temperature). Based on our observations, the assumption that growth of planted and ratoon grain sorghum are similar appears to be in error. However, the phenology of grain-forming ratoon tillers appeared to mimic the phenology of the planted crop's primary shoot.","June 1990","2015-06-03 03:08:02","2015-06-04 13:40:29","","205-219","","3–4","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); ALL(ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction models with high level of significance were developed for P availability in soil that varied with the type of residue incorporated. From these models, the amount of P that is likely to be extractable can be computed on a given day, up to 120 days as done in this investigation. At 0.5 FC, incorporation of loppings of perennial pigeonpea, sorghum stover and FYM caused initial immobilization of P which levelled off at about 21 to 31 days of incubation. No P immobilization was observed with other residues at 0.5 FC. At FC, none of the residues caused immobilization. The quantity of P released was significantly related to the amount of P added through residues.

These provide novel contexts in which to study source vs. sink limitations of plant productivity. This is one of the first investigations of source: sink effects on photosynthesis, seed size, and regrowth in perennial cereal crops as well as in the commercially important annual rye (Secale cereale L.). Through experimental manipulations of field-grown plants, we studied the effect of manipulations of source: sink ratio (25% decreases and 100% increases) on photosynthetic rate in perennial wheat [Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. R. Dewey], perennial rye [S. cereale x Secale strictum (C. Presl) C. Presl subsp. strictum (syn. Secale mon-tanum Guss.)], annual wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and annual rye. We measured carbohydrate pools, seed size, and regrowth as further indices of source vs. sink limitation. Perennial wheat showed sink limitation throughout. Annual and perennial rye appeared to be colimited. Low source: sink ratios in perennial wheat and rye were associated with up to 25% higher photosynthetic rates while high source: sink ratios led to up to 20% decreases. Seed size showed more stability under source: sink manipulation in perennials than in annuals while regrowth of perennials was not affected by source sink ratio, and all three species showed more stability of seed size in response to source: sink manipulation than annual wheat. Our results are consistent with perennial cereals operating below their maximum photosynthetic capacity, in contrast to annual wheat, and following a conservative reproductive strategy. By selecting for greater sink strength in perennial wheat, breeders may be able to achieve higher rates of photosynthesis and support higher yields in this new crop.","JAN-FEB  2014","2015-06-03 04:34:30","2015-06-03 09:40:10","","274-283","","1","54","","Crop Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000336745400024","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (rye OR secale) AND NOT (""rye grass"" OR ""rye-grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We fully reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of AA- genome species with confidence. Oryza meridionalis, native to Australia, is found to be the earliest divergent lineage around 2.93 mya, whereas O. punctata, a BB- genome species, serves as the best outgroup to distinguish their phylogenetic relationships. They separated from O. punctata approximately 9.11 mya during the Miocene epoch, and subsequently radiated to generate the entire AA- genome lineage diversity.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different cultivations (DS: direct-seeding, ST: seedling-throwing, TP: transplanting) and planting periods of the main crop on physiological traits and rice yields, as well as to find the source of the nutrients in the ratoon crop by studying the stubble dry matter and nitrogen translocation of pre-anthesis and its efficiency in the ratoon crop. The yields of the main crop were different significantly. The yield of TP was significantly higher than ST and DS as well as the yield of D3 was more than the yields of other periods. In the ratoon crop, the yield of D1 was more than that in other periods. The ratooning ability was different significantly among different cultivations. The cultivations affected the tillering ability in the ratoon crop and the translocation of the stubble dry matter and nitrogen uptaking in which TP was better than others. From March to April, sowing or transplanting date did not affect the stubble dry matter and N translocation of pre-anthesis and its efficiency.

For this, the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth) as a fallow crop was evaluated in variety, establishment, and cropping systems studies conducted at Houay Khot station (19°N) from 1992 to 1995. Introduced perennial varieties were not superior to local material for the parameters evaluated. Some semi-perennial varieties produced grain yields up to 2.2 t ha-1 but were inferior in weed suppression and survival 12 months after planting. All varieties lost much of their weed competitiveness after the first picking of pods. In studies without weeding, &lt; 10% initially established plants were present 15 months after planting. Compared with pigeon pea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala performed better in biomass production, weed suppression, persistence, and self-regeneration after cultivation of rice. In a rotation study, rice yield was 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.2 t ha-1 (LSD 5% = 0.5 t) for continuous rice, rice-pigeon pea intercropping, rice after pigeon pea, rice after cowpea, rice after Stylosanthes hamata, rice after maize, and rice after fallow, respectively. Compared with continuous rice, intercropping or rotation with pigeon pea reduced nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infestation of rice and weed biomass in the rice crop. In spite of the beneficial effects, rotation or intercropping systems with pigeon pea will only he viable if economic benefits from harvested grain or from using plant parts as livestock feed can be obtained. Because of high mortality and weed invasion pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement if fallow duration is more than one year.","1997","2015-06-03 05:48:20","2015-06-03 05:48:20","","45-57","","1","39","","Agrofor.

No insecticides or fungicides were utilized before or during the experiment. Frequent fertilization of the water and a low rice plant biomass during the early vegetative growth phase stimulated the development of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The total weed biomass was low (maximum = 5.3 g dry weight m-2) and not significantly (P &lt; 0.05) different between the treatments. A major component of the silver barb diet consisted of rice plants and accessible grains. However, the introduction of silver barb only had a significant effect on the number of rice tillers in the ratoon crop and not on the paddy yield. The quantitative differences in the diets of tilapia and common carp were minimal: both species fed mostly on detritus. Ricefields without silver barb produced the highest paddy yield (3120 kg ha-1). The total yield of introduced fish increased after increasing the stocking density of silver barb from 319.9 to 494.1 kg ha-1. The highest fish yield (541.8 kg ha-1) was obtained by stocking pre-grown fingerlings in the ricefields.","1998","2015-06-03 04:11:23","2015-06-03 10:19:22","","649-660","","9","29","","Aquac.

This genus has been a considerable challenge to plant systematists because of the impacts of polyploidization on the evolution of this group. This study was aimed to augment existing cytogenetic data with a sequence-based investigation of the genomes of these species. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), introns 9 through 11 of the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI) gene and intron III of the beta-amylase gene (Bmy1) were isolated from the genomes of polyploid Thinopyrum species by PCR, cloning and sequencing and the evolutionary distances between these species and putative diploid ancestors were estimated with Kimura's two-parameter method. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences largely agrees with what has been established through cytogenetic means for the Th. caespitosum (Koch) Liu & Wang and Ps geniculata (Trin.) Á. Löve, and suggests a contribution of the St genome of Ps. spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve to the tetraploids Th. scirpeum (Presl) Dewey and Th. junceiforme (Á. Löve & D. Löve) Á. Löve. A unique Bmy1 allele, divergent from other Triticeae but shared between Th. caespitosum, Th. intermedium (Host) Barkworth & Dewey, Th. junceum (L.) Á. Löve and Th. ponticum Barkworth & Dewey, implies a connection between these species. Distinct oligonucleotide polymorphisms and distance calculations based on the three loci implicate Crithopsis delileana (Schult.) Roshev. and Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski in the evolution of the hexaploid Th. intermedium and the decaploid Th. ponticum and also suggest a potential connection of these polyploids with Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. ex Nevski. None of these species have been previously associated with the Thinopyrum genus. Allele-specific PCR was employed to detect the putative Crithopsis allele of ITS1 in a number of accessions. Real-time PCR indicates that two of six genomes of the hexaploid Th. intermedium have the Crithopsis-type ITS1 allele and that all ITS1 loci in the decaploid Th. ponticum are of this type. These results are supportive of the hypothesis that concerted evolution has homogenized the rDNA of Th. ponticum to the allele derived from the Crithopsis or Taeniatherum ancestor. Discovery of these novel alleles, with close homology to Ta. caput-medusae, may represent a fundamental change in the view of the evolution of Th. intermedium and Th. ponticum.","2011","2015-06-03 03:18:20","2015-06-03 20:33:34","","8-27","","1","148","","Hereditas","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","allele; Alleles; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); article; Base Sequence; beta amylase; beta-Amylase; Cell Nucleus; Consensus Sequence; controlled study; Crithopsis; Crithopsis delileana; cytogenetics; diploidy; DNA polymorphism; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Elymus repens; gene isolation; gene locus; gene sequence; Genes, Plant; Genome, Chloroplast; Genome, Plant; hexaploidy; Hydroida; internal transcribed spacer; intron; molecular cloning; molecular evolution; Molecular Sequence Data; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Phylogeny; plant gene; Poaceae; Polymorphism, Genetic; polyploidy; real time polymerase chain reaction; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; sequence alignment; sequence homology; SPV; starch synthase; Taeniatherum; Taeniatherum caput-medusae; tetraploidy; Thinopyrum; Thinopyrum curvifolium; Thinopyrum distichum; Thinopyrum junceiforme; Thinopyrum sartorii; Triticeae; unindexed sequence; Wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In screen cage studies, the duration of the egg stage was 22 days and peak hatching was observed 47 days after adults were released onto plants. The duration of the 1st- to 5th-instar nymphs were 6-21, 12-21, 9-19, 10-20 and 10-20 days, resp. On ratoon rice, adult emergence occurred after 80-90 days.

A study was undertaken from December 2009 until December 2010 in the Ayeyarwady River Delta, the major lowland rice-producing area of Myanmar, to monitor the population dynamics of M. graminicola and H. oryzae in a naturally infested field. Root samples of the two rice varieties Yatanartoe and Taungpyan that are commonly cultivated in double rice-cropping sequences in Myanmar and represent irrigated and rainfed lowland rice varieties, respectively, were obtained for nematode analysis. During the summer-irrigated rice-growing season the root population density of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. graminicola showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in January and at the heading stage of the rice plants in March 2010. With the onset of the monsoon rains, the J2 population densities in the roots of ratoon rice plants gradually decreased in May. During the rainfed monsoon rice-growing season, very low population densities of M. graminicola J2 were detected in the roots of rice plants, while the root population density of H. oryzae juveniles and adults showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in August and at the heading stage of the rice plants in October 2010. With the onset of the dry season, population density of H. oryzae in the roots reached the lowest density at harvest in November. Root galling caused by M. graminicola followed the same trend as the J2 population densities throughout the irrigated season. No root galls were observed during the monsoon season. Our results can be used for practical purposes aimed at a better management of both M. graminicola and H. oryzae.","2013","2015-06-03 04:47:03","2015-06-03 04:47:03","","795-807","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000325194400004","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Present study was conducted to investigate its population fluctuations, to determine the factors affecting abundance, and to develop the models for forecasting its population abundance based on the data collected from the monitored fields and traps from 1982 to 2002 in Chiayi region. According to the catches of adult by traps and the population monitoring in paddy fields, the population of WBPH in recent years tended to increase distinctively, especially in the second cropping season. It was observed that the WBPH could overwinter on ratooning rice in Taiwan with a very low population of macropterous adult which could supposedly migrate to the early-planted rice of the first cropping season from late December to the beginning of January. The adults of the first generation from the early- planted rice appeared from late March to early April and most of them migrate to the later planted rice. The population peak in the first cropping season mostly appeared during the nymphal stage of the third generation from late May to early June. However, the population abundance in the third generation was positively correlated with the total catches of air-borne net trap from late April to early May, but not with the overwintered population, indicating the influence of immigrant population affecting its peak population was greater than that of locally overwintered population. On ratooning rice of the first cropping season, very rare nymph could be observable, except macropterous adults. In the second cropping season, the WBPH went through 3 to 4 generations. The populations of the insect in paddy fields were greatly affected by the date and population of immigrants as well as the planting time of rice. The early-planted rice usually received higher population of the immigrants, and the population peak mostly appeared in the fifth generation, while in the common (middle) or later-planted rice, the population peak appeared in the nymphal stage of the sixth or seventh generation, but mostly in the seventh generation in the later planted rice. Population abundance was positively correlated with the total catches by light trap in August, and the temperature in September and October, but it was negatively correlated with the average temperature in August and rainfall in September and October. The population declined sharply in the eighth generation from late October to early November, and macropterous adults could rarely be observed on ratooning rice from December to early January in a few years. Several models for forecasting its population abundance both in the first and second cropping season were developed for further tests of their validity.","December  2004","2015-06-03 04:48:58","2015-06-03 04:48:58","","315-332","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200500110353","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to develop a strategy for evaluation of natural resources, systematic leaf sampling has been conducted and their genetic characteristics measured with 16 SSR loci. In order to determine population structure, a small number of individuals localized together were regarded as sub-populations belonging to a single mother population. Annual individuals were clustered at particular peripheral areas of the pond. Perennial individuals were close by and growing within deeper pond water. Scores of observed heterozygosity (Ho) were not significantly different between annual and perennial sub-populations, but relatively lower in annual ones. Genetic distance among annual and perennial sub-populations in close juxtaposition at peripheral sites showed that annuals were clustered against perennials. In addition, comparison of perennial sub-populations peripheral areas and inside the swamp, found they clustered together and were some distance from annual ones. When the genetic components were compared in detail, private alleles were frequently found in annual plants, suggesting there might be restriction of gene flow between annual and perennial types. Partitions of deep water perennial sub-populations identified private alleles in particular areas, suggesting there were some areas with unique polymorphisms. Combining peripheral perennial sub-populations led to the disappearance of most private alleles which implied there is frequent gene flow among perennial sub-populations. This in-situ conservation site allowed us to observe the succession of populations and also to research detailed population structure of a typical wild population and this found wild rice genetic structure in this single swamp is complex. The data obtained will provide valuable insight about how to evaluate wild populations genetically and how to deal with such populations as field collections.","OCT  2012","2015-06-03 04:22:50","2015-06-03 10:30:24","","311-322","","5","87","","Genes Genet.

Two experiments were carried out under controlled temperatures during two consecutive seasons. Biomass investment in roots and other vegetative organs, flowering rates between plants and within the plant, and gas exchange parameters were measured in L. fendleri and L. mendocina in both well-watered and water-stressed plants during flowering. Water stress increased the duration of the flowering phase by up to 15 days in L. fendleri and reduced the rate of stem production per plant by 20% at 110 days after sowing (DAS) in both species (p < 0.01). Independently of the water treatment, only a fraction of the plants reached the reproductive stage in L. mendocina, while the number of reproductive stems per flowered plant was 50% lower than in L. fendleri (p < 0.05). L. mendocina partitioned a higher proportion of biomass to roots and above-ground vegetative organs (p < 0.05), and leaf water-use efficiency (WUE) was 35% higher (p < 0.05).

This is particularly important in the Great Plains of North America, where increased C storage under conservation tillage represents millions of dollars in C credits. However, we contend that the logic behind such trading is imperfect on multiple levels. We suggest that increased C storage in Great Plains soils with conservation tillage can, at best, only partially replenish what was previously emitted by tillage of native prairies. Furthermore, there is disagreement on whether reduced tillage actually does increase C storage in prairie soils. Use of alternative agricultural practices that emulate natural prairie diversity, processes, and function, as well as the establishment of permanent prairie reserves, will aid in recovery of previously lost C and provide for increased biodiversity and resilience in the face of changing climate conditions.","2011","2015-06-03 03:18:05","2015-06-03 20:38:32","","407-413","","7","9","","Frontiers Ecol.

A possible donor of the trait for ratoon or stubble cropping is O. rufipogon. The other species possessing rhizome formation ability for breeding of perennial rice are O. longistaminata, O. officinalis, O. rhizomatis and O. australiensis. In this study, the perennial trait was transferred from wild species O. longistaminata, O. rhizomatis and O. officinalis to cultivated rice ( O. sativa) through distant hybridization.

Leafhopper vectors and associated natural enemies were sampled by a D-Vac suction machine from rice crops, nurseries, and fallow fields in Malaysia between December 1983 and May 1984. Leersia hexandra Sw. vegetation in wet, fallow rice fields harbored significantly higher densities of Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky). Nephotettix virescens (Distant) was relatively abundant in second-stage rice nurseries. Nephotettix nigropictus (Stål) and N. malayanus Ishihara et Kawase were only moderately abundant or absent in the habitats sampled. Nephotettix parvus Ishihara et Kawase, a reported vector, was not caught. Spiders, in particular hunting spiders and orbweb weavers, numerically comprised the major natural enemy guilds in all habitats except in direct-seeded rice and single-stage nurseries, where predatory insects were more abundant. Egg parasitoids were the only parasitoid guild in all habitats except in L. hexandra vegetation where low numbers of nymphal-adult parasitoids were recovered as well. Oryza sativa, Fimbristylis miliacea (L.) Vahl and L. hexandra were the most commonly encountered tungro hosts. All habitats with rice potentially perpetuate tungro, particularly ratoon and volunteer rice which carry tungro and vectors to the next season crop and nurseries which are more susceptible to vectors and tungro infection. Fimbristylis miliacea may act as a tungro reservoir when rice is absent but cannot support vectors. Leersia hexandra harbors high densities of vectors but its role as a tungro host is more limited. Elimination of fallows with rice or tungro hosts is recommended as a preventive practice. However, weedy habitats without tungro hosts are beneficial as they harbor a variety of natural enemies of tungro vectors. Such vegetation should be tolerated where possible. Resistant varieties or selective insecticides should be used to prevent tungro infection in the nursery stage without destroying the diverse natural enemy complex.","May 1990","2015-06-03 03:07:12","2015-06-04 12:22:51","","1-15","","1","31","","Agric.

Because most annual crops have less extensive, shorter-lived root systems than do perennial species, with a correspondingly lower capacity to manage nutrients and water, annual cropping systems tend to suffer higher levels of soil erosion and generate greater water contamination than do perennial systems. In an effort to reduce soil degradation and water contamination simultaneously - something that neither no-till nor organic cropping alone can accomplish - researchers in the United States, Australia and other countries have begun breeding perennial counterparts of annual grain and legume crops. Initial cycles of hybridization, propagation and selection in wheat, wheatgrasses, sorghum, sunflower and Illinois bundleflower have produced perennial progenies with phenotypes intermediate between wild and cultivated species, along with improved grain production. Further breeding cycles will be required to develop agronomically adapted perennial crops with high grain yields.","2010","2015-06-03 03:18:32","2015-06-03 09:50:28","","513-521","","7","61","","Crop Pasture Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44396622&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); alternative agriculture; cropping practice; Crop production; Desmanthus illinoensis; food supply; Helianthus; hybridization; legume; perennial N1 grain; perennial plant; phenotype; Plant breeding; relevant; Root system; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; search.wheat; selective breeding; Soil erosion; Sorghum; SPV; Sunflower; Sustainable agriculture; Triticum aestivum; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); vegetable oil; Water pollution; Web of Science; Wheat","cropping systems; Desmanthus illinoensis; food supply; grain crops; grain yield; Helianthus annuus; hybridization; legumes; nutrients; oilseed crops; root systems; soil erosion; soil water; staple foods; United States; water pollution; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A perennial dual-purpose cereal could confer additional economic and environmental benefits. We establish that, at the end of a second growth season, selected perennial cereals were able to achieve up to 10-fold greater below-ground biomass than a resown annual wheat. We review and expand the data on available, diverse, perennial, wheat-derived germplasm, confirming that perenniality is achievable but that further improvements are essential through targeted breeding. Although not yet commercially deployable, the grain yields and dry matter production of the best performing lines approach the benchmarks predicted to achieve profitability. On reviewing the genomic composition of the most promising wheat-derived perennials, we conclude that the best near-term prospect of a productive breeding program for a perennial, wheat-derived cereal will utilise a diploid, perennial donor species, and the most promising one thus far is Thinopyrum elongatum. Furthermore, the breeding should be aimed at complete wheat-Th. elongatum amphiploids, a hybrid synthetic crop analogous to triticale. We advocate the generation of many primary amphiploids involving a diversity of Th. elongatum accessions and a diversity of adapted annual wheat cultivars. Primary perennial amphiploids would be inter-crossed and advanced with heavy, early-generation selection for traits such as semi-dwarf plant height, non-shattering heads, large seed size and good self-fertility, followed by later generation selection for robust perenniality, days to flowering, grain yield, forage yield, stability of grain yield across seasons, and disease resistance.","2014","2015-06-03 04:19:58","2015-06-03 10:08:11","","1147-1164","","11","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000345323600007","","","","relevant; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government has undertaken embankment and sluice-gate projects to protect boro crops from early flash flood water. While the major beneficiaries of these projects will be medium and large farmers who own over 70% of the cultivable land, the landless and small farmers may also benefit from more secured ratoon cultivation. This study, conducted in three haor areas in Sunamganj district, indicates that ratoon cropping is an important source of self-employment for the landless and small farmers and contributes a significant portion of their income. Ratoons are currently grown on only a small proportion of boro land, because of the problem of early flash floods, and lack of interest by medium and large farmers who own the land, for reasons of social prestige. However, the area under ratoon is expected to increase as embankments are completed. Reducing the risk of ratoon cropping through embankments increases the probability that medium and large farms will grow ratoons. The government can protect the interests of the rural poor by enacting rules for a ratoon sharing arrangement.","1990","2015-06-03 04:52:07","2015-06-03 04:52:07","","121-131","","1/2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19931852237","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many perennial spring crops are also highly frost resistant. The author's early work with hybrids between wild and cultivated species is mentioned with more recent work on the production of perennial wheat and the problem of eliminating the F 1 sterility in wheat x perennial rye crosses. After 189, 000 pollinations, hybrid combinations were chosen which on back-crossing gave a set of 0.01-2.00 per cent. Only a very small proportion of the plants raised from such seed showed normal fertility. In a cross between Leucurum 1364/1 and perennial rye apparently back-crossed to perennial rye two large seeds were obtained of the Triticum durum type. One of these seeds produced a normally fertile plant. The hybrid proved to have 42 chromosomes and was therefore an amphidiploid resulting from the union of two unreduced gametes. No back-crossing to the rye had therefore occurred. This plant produced seed in 1933 and twice (summer and winter) in 1934 and 1935, thus indicating a perennial wheat had been obtained. The numerous progenies were resistant to drought and rust, being only slightly attacked by brown rust and not at all by stem or yellow rust; they also showed high yields, e.g. 70 grains per ear with a 1000 grain weight up to 50 grm. The perennial wheat is a vigourous plant which in the second year frequently gives a higher yield and usually ripens 10-15 days earlier than the autumn sowing of the first year. It can also be used for hay, yielding about 1-2 tons per hectare. The second harvest in the year amounts to 50-80 per cent of the first and the 1000 grain weight is 35 grm. The winter-hardiness of the hybrids has been little studied but the winter form survived the 1935-36 winter. In 1937 a few plants without the defect of fragile ears were selected and the type is to be tested in variety trials. A coefficient of multiplication of 11, 339 has been obtained and, in 1938 it is hoped, 30, 000 grains may be obtained from 100 plants from one grain. Spring forms were also found among the hybrids. Similar investigations axe being conducted with perennial hybrids from perennial x annual rye and wild perennial rye plants are also being collected for breeding plants suitable for use as hay. Work has also been done on perennial vetches ( Vicia cracca and Lathyrus species) and sorghum. Forms of L. latifolius with non-splitting pods have been obtained, while perennial sorghum hybrids should prove valuable in view of their normal fertility, great drought resistance, hardiness under poor soil conditions and high coefficient of multiplication.","1938","2015-06-03 04:34:16","2015-06-03 09:41:51","","213-19","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19391600180","","","","relevant; search.rye; search.sorghum; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Out of 60 random primers, which were initially screened against DNA from four individuals, 20 generated highly reproducible RAPD fragments which were then used for further population analysis. With these primers, 95 discernible DNA fragments were produced and 78 (82.1%) were polymorphic, which indicated that high levels of genetic variation existed in these natural populations. In addition, the Chinese populations showed greater polymorphism than those from Brazil at both the population and regional levels. This is noteworthy considering that the Chinese populations are from a relatively restricted area of China. The factors responsible for these findings include the contrasting mating systems in the Brazilian and Chinese populations, and gene flow from annual cultivated rice to perennial natural populations in China. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation between individuals within populations, between populations within regions, and between regions. Results showed that 61.8% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two continents, whereas only 14.9% and 23.3% was attributable to population differences within regions and to individual differences within a population, respectively. The great genetic differentiation between the Chinese and Brazilian populations is in agreement with recent treatment of the American form of O. rufipogon as a separate species, O. glumaepatula.","JUN  1999","2015-06-03 04:23:31","2015-06-03 09:57:54","","638-644","","","82","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000081323900007","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND22020814&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); analysis of molecular variance; Brazil; China; DNA fragment; gene flow; genetic difference; genetic diversity; genetic variance; Genetic variation; Mating system; Oryza glumaepatula; Oryza rufipogon; perennial N1 (oryza OR rice); primer DNA; Random amplified polymorphic DNA; RAPDs; relevant; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science; wild relative","Brazil; China; genetic polymorphism; genetic variation; Oryza rufipogon; random amplified polymorphic DNA technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work was initiated to gain more understanding on the seasonal effects on tillering and ratoon cropping of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in the high rainfall tropics by studying the effects of various daylengths and temperature regimes on plant growth and development and yields of ratoon crops. Sorghum plants were grown under two daylengths and four temperature regimes in controlled-environment chambers. Temperatures and daylengths used simulated tropical winter and summer conditions similar to rainfed sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) plantations of Hawaii where ratoon sorghum has been grown. It is contemplated that sorghum could be used as an alternate crop for sugarcane plantations phasing out of production and that ratooning the crop could be utilized as a management practice, thus reducing the high cost of production. An interaction between photoperiod and temperature was observed. With low temperature (23.9 C-day/15.5 C-night) and short day (10 hours), fewer tillers/plant were produced resulting in the development of fewer reproductive tillers. At the same low night and day temperatures, but with photoperiod increased from 10 to 14 hours, more tillers/plant, more reproductive tillers/plant, greater leaf area, more leaves, more numerous but shorter internodes, and longer panicles were produced. The check plants grown outside produced more reproductive tillers/plant than the various treatments. Increasing both the temperature (32.2 C-day/23.9 C-night) and daylength (14 hours) resulted in further increase in tiller number/plant, leaf area, and internode number. Higher temperature and shorter daylength tended to bring about early maturity. Low light intensity, short photoperiod, and low temperature, resulted in rosette form of foliage with very short internodes and reduced number of leaves. This condition led to low grain and stover yields.","1975","2015-06-04 04:54:40","2015-06-04 12:28:10","2015-06-04 04:54:40","479","","4","67","","","Ratoon Cropping of Sorghum","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench) from plant crop to succeeding ratoon crops in order to attain maximum production with minimum tillage using a particular practice such as ratooning. Under this system, it is possible to have several harvests from a single planting. Time and location of tiller appearance and survival of tillers are important factors in determining the number and vigor of productive tillers which, in turn, influence the growth, development, yields, and longevity of ratoon crops. Successive tiller production and death of tillers affect the perenniality of the crop. Three cultivars of sorghum ‘Mini-milo Br 54’, NK 222A, and NK 300 were grown under three plant populations [P1 = 5, P2 = 10, and P3 = 20 plants per 3.7 liter (5-gal.) pot] and were observed for tillering behavior in relation to the place of origin, time of appearance, duration of early tillers, and to grain and stover yields. Tillers that sprouted early (first and second tillers) originated from basal nodes of the plant. Later tillers (third, fourth, and so on) developed from the nodes adjacent to elongated internodes. Not all tillers which developed, however, reached maturity. Usually the first two tillers died. Tillers developed earlier in lower populations (P1 and P2) than in the higher population, P3. Cultivar NK 222A produced only two tillers per plant in each population. Compared with tillers of ratoon crops, it took a longer time for the two early tillers of the plant crop to die. Tillers that developed on the upper parts of the stubble were more susceptible to breakage. More tillers were produced during the plant crop, and the number declined in each succeeding ratoon crop. High plant populations resulted in development of few reproductive tiller, less uniformity in plant height, and a delay in tiller formation. In spite of this condition, increased plant population resulted in increased grain and stover yields. More plants per unit area compensated for the production of fewer tillers. Mini-milo Br 54 produced the highest number of tillers per plant, followed by NK 222A, and then NK 300 in the first population. Understanding the basic growth patterns and tillering behavior of a particular sorghum variety, therefore, facilitates management of ratoon crops for maximum production.","1975","2015-06-04 04:52:00","2015-06-04 04:54:01","2015-06-04 04:52:00","473","","4","67","","","Ratoon Cropping of Sorghum","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The identification of an appropriate technology with low input, such as ratooning, would allow this niche to be utilized. Field experiments were conducted at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 cropping seasons to evaluate the performance of the main and ratooned crops of lowland NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in a lowland rice-ratooned rice-fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook F.) sequence. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The lowland rice varieties used were NERICA-L 19, NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 22, NERICA-L 24, OFADA, NERICA-L 26, NERICA-L 41, NERICA-L 42, NERICA-L 44 and NERICA-L 47. The grain yield of the main rice crop ranged from 5.0 to 7.3 t ha-1 in 2007-2008 cropping season and from 4.1 to 9.1 t ha-1 in 2008-2009. The ratooned rice had a grain yield of 1.0-4.7 t ha-1 in 2007-2008 and 1.2-3.4 t ha -1 in 2008-2009. The total grain yield obtained in 2007-2008 from the main and ratooned rice crops in seven months was 6.7-11.6 t ha-1, while in 2008-2009 it was 5.3-2.6 t ha-1. The fresh leaf yield of fluted pumpkin ranged from 14.6 to 16.9 t ha-1 in 2007-2008 and from 18.3 to 19.8 t ha-1 in 2008-2009, similar to previously reported rainy season unfertilized yields. Thus, a ratooned rice crop appears to be a feasible technology capable of boosting rice production and consequently increasing the overall productivity of the inland valley in a rice-rice-vegetable cropping sequence.","2012","2015-06-03 04:09:22","2015-06-03 20:32:30","","551-562","","4","48","","Exp.

Seven photoperiod-sensitive rice cultivars (BR22, BR23, BRRI dhan34, BRRI dhan37, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan40 and BRRI dhan41), including three fine grain aromatic cultivars (BRRI dhan 34, BRRI dhan37 and BRRI dhan38), were transplanted on 15 and 30 December 2001. After harvest of the boro crop, the ratoons were allowed to grow and in the succeeding aman, a good harvest was obtained from those ratoons. In the boro season, the highest yield was obtained from BRRI dhan41 (7.51 t/ha) followed by BR23 (7.06 t/ha). The yield of aromatic cultivars was ~5 t/ha. The ratoon yields of both aromatic and non-aromatic cultivars in the succeeding aman season were also encouraging and produced ~2 t/ha, which was more than the average yield of local cultivars normally cultivated in the transplanted aman season in that region. The highest yield was obtained by BR23 (2.87 t/ha) followed by BRRI dhan37 (2.63 t/ha). From this experiment, it was revealed that the photoperiod-sensitive rice cultivars could be planted in the early boro season and the ratoons from this crop also produced a good harvest. This might be a low-cost rice cultivation technique in those areas, where crop establishment in the transplanted aman season is somewhat difficult due to the early intrusion of tidal water in the field at the end of boro season.","2004","2015-06-03 04:49:06","2015-06-03 04:49:06","","368-371","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20043039585","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-stubble and node-cutting experiments were conducted. The length of the middle nodes' axillary buds was longer than that of other nodes during fully heading stage (FHS) in the main crop. The growth rate of all axillary buds was slow from FHS to 20 days after FHS, and accelerated from 20 days after FHS to maturing stage. However, the growth rate of higher nodes' axillary buds was faster than that of lower nodes. Plant height of ratooning rice of the 2nd and 3rd node from the top of Pei'ai 64S/E32 and of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th node from the top of Peiliangyou 500 in vitro were shorter than in vivo. The higher the nodal position the bigger the difference in height. Compared to those in vivo, the panicle length and spikelets per panicle of all ratooning rice nodes in vitro were higher. The lower the node position the bigger the difference, which suggests that the dependence of middle and higher node axillary buds to stubble nutrition was higher than that of lower nodes, and the limitation of nutrient application to lower node axillary buds was higher than that to higher ones in vivo. The difference between ratooning rate of axillary buds from different nodes was bigger in vivo than that in vitro. The correlation between total N content of internodes and ratooning rate of corresponding axillary buds was positive at 0.05 level from FHS to 10 days after FHS, but it was negative or very weak from 20 days after FHS to maturing stage. The higher soluble sugar and starch content in full heading stage did not increase ratooning rate. From 10 days after FHS to maturing stage, negative correlation existed between starch content and ratooning rate, and positive correlation existed between soluble sugar content, soluble sugar and starch in gross and ratooning rate. The results suggests that total N content of internodes is the main deciding factor in determining the ratooning rate of corresponding-node axillary buds in early productive stage.","2005","2015-06-03 04:48:43","2015-06-03 04:48:43","","330-336","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20053068955","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T. ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra, a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control.

Our research was conducted in 250-L (0.95 m height, 0.58 m i.d.) custom-made water control lysimeters filled with a Pahokee muck soil (euic, hyperthermic Lithic Medisaprist). Ratoon reflood timing treatments were 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 d drained beginning at main-crop maturity. Ratoon-crop grain yield exhibited a significant quadratic response to length of drain period with maximum grain yield produced at 28 d drained. Ratoon panicle number was not affected by reflood timing, but quadratic responses to length of drain period were observed for grain number and 1000 grain weight. We propose that the resultant effect of reflood timing on ratoon grain yield was the combined responses to increasing mineral N supply and increasing water stress associated with delayed reflooding. For drained durations < 28 d, the beneficial effects of increased mineral N supply resulting from organic matter oxidation resulted in a net increase in ratoon-crop yield. Conversely, for drained periods > 28 d, the detrimental impact of prolonged water stress dominated the response to reflood timing and ratoon rice yields declined.","May 1994","2015-06-03 02:04:03","2015-06-03 09:48:58","","478-482","","3","86","","AGRON.

Since perennial plants allocate resources preferentially to perpetuation and to structural and functional characters that provide drought tolerance, they tend to have lower reproductive output (yield) than their congeneric annuals. Four species of Lesquerella native to arid regions were evaluated to understand the relationships between reproduction, drought tolerance, and their association with the plant's life span. We assessed the following set of characters (defined as plant strategies): phenology, gas exchange, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, total biomass and biomass allocation. Annual (Lesquerella gracilis and Lesquerella angustifolia) and perennial (Lesquerella mendocina and Lesquerella pinetorum) species were compared under water limiting conditions. Within this set of species differences in structural and functional characters were observed. The annual, L. gracilis showed a plant strategy characterized by high reproductive output, harvest index (HI) and specific leaf area (SLA). L. mendocina (perennial), produced more total biomass, but had a low reproductive output, and also showed characters that provide drought tolerance (high allocation to roots-root mass ratio (RMR), and storage-total non structural carbohydrates (TNC) and low SLA). The annual L. angustifolia and the perennial L. pinetorum had intermediate plant strategies (i.e. intermediate values of traits typically related with annual or perennial life span). In the case of L. pinetorum we found some traits common to L. mendocina: long vegetative period, high biomass, CO2 assimilation rate (A), and water use efficiency (WUE), and low SLA. The high reproductive output in L. pinetorum was a result of both, higher total biomass and longer growing season compared to the annuals, and of higher HI in relation to the other perennial. These differences in plant strategies among perennial Lesquerella show that there are different combinations of traits that could be used as criteria for the selection of a perennial crop in programs of domestication for Patagonia and others arid lands.","September 2011","2015-06-03 02:27:23","2015-06-03 09:58:40","","1386-1392","","2","34","","Ind.

The removal of vernalization changes helps the plant to form organs which have the ability to undergo hardening, and by this to acquire a great degree of frost resistance. The removal of vernalization changes does not mean rejuvenation, and the plant developing again during this process remains older in age. The process of removal represents 1 of lengthening the graded development of the perennial plant, but not a return to its original state. The phenomenon of removal of vernalization and similar changes is distributed among all living forms of perennial plants[long dash]grasses, shrubs, and trees; because of this, we can hardly be mistaken if we say that it is one of the cardinal physiological processes which determine the ability of these plants to survive the unfavorable period of winter, and in essence determines the possibility of survival of many of them as perennials.","1958","2015-06-03 04:38:22","2015-06-04 08:22:37","","158-165","","(2)","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19593400005585","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, almost all of the major grain crops are herbaceous annuals and opportunities to replace them with more long-lived perennials have been poorly explored. This follows the presumption that the perennial life cycle is associated with a lower potential yield, due to a reduced allocation of biomass to grains. The hypothesis was tested that allocation to perpetuation organs in the perennial L. mendocina would not be directly related to a lower allocation to seeds. • Methods: Two field experiments were carried on with the annual Lesquerella fendleri and the iteroparous perennial L. mendocina, two promising oil-seed crops for low-productivity environments, subjected to different water and nitrogen availability. • Key Results: Seed biomass allocation was similar for both species, and unresponsive to water and nitrogen availability. Greater root and vegetative shoot allocation in the perennial was counterbalanced by a lower allocation to other reproductive structures compared with the annual Lesquerella. Allometric relationships revealed that allocation differences between the annual and the perennial increased linearly with plant size. The general allocation patterns for nitrogen did not differ from those of biomass. However, nitrogen concentrations were higher in the vegetative shoot and root of L. mendocina than of L. fendleri but remained stable in seeds of both species. • Conclusions: It is concluded that vegetative organs are more hierarchically important sinks in L. mendocina than in the annual L. fendleri, but without disadvantages in seed hierarchy.","2005","2015-06-03 03:19:21","2015-06-03 20:58:39","","127-135","","1","96","","Ann.

Their mating status and ovarian developmental stages were monitored, and their reproductive capacity on rice plants was determined in the laboratory. Sexually reproductive individuals occurred consistently from early July to mid-September, which accounted for more than 50% of the females in most collections. Less than 7% of females seemed to be reproducing parthenogenetically. In the laboratory, 45.1% of females were mated within 9 days after emergence. For females emerging in late July and late August, only 17.4 and 6.1%, respectively, developed to ovipositing and post-ovipositing stages after feeding on rice plants for 4 weeks. These results indicated that in Southeast Texas >80% of summer females entered diapause after emergence, but reproductive females often are abundant later in rice fields.

Institute of Grain Husbandry of Southeastern USSR Wheat Work at this Institute included propagation of the recently selected spring wheats Lutescens 53/12 and Albidum 43, and selection of the following new spring varieties: Lutescens 758, Albidum 21, 24 and 210. Besides these, the spring wheats Saratovskaja [Saratov] 27 and 28 and Lutescens 1433 and 1237 have been obtained by complex hybridization methods. The Station has submitted to State Trials the new spring wheat varieties Flora 5, 6 and 7. Flora 5 appears to be more productive than Lutescens 62 under conditions of the Non-Black Earth Belt. A hardy winter wheat Lutescens 319 has been selected. Buckwheat Tetraploids have been produced of 22 local varieties. Oats Hybrid 113 (- Nemcinovsku [Nemcinov] 2) has been obtained from Moskovskii [Moscow] A-3 15 x Orel [Eagle]. The variety is large grained, resistant to lodging and yields 27 c. per ha. more than the standard. Rye A new variety, Volzanka [Volga], has been bred, yielding 24-5 centners per hectare. Barley Breeding for gluten content is in progress. Agropyron hybrids The study of Cicin's Agropyron wheat hybrids was carried on. Optimal quantities of seed for sowing for each hybrid variety were determined. The most promising of the perennial wheats in the districts around Moscow are the varieties 2, 3 and M-164. They can be harvested two years in succession, some plants surviving the third year. These wheats produce grain of good baking properties containing 21-74% crude protein. Some 2000 families of other perennial hybrids are undergoing selection for their perennial habit. The annual Agropyron-wheat hybrids 599 (= Sehurdinovka), 4871, 186 and 64/65 and the square heads 1 and 2 have been submitted to State Tests. An aniphidiploid was obtained in 1947 of the hitherto sterile wheat-rye-Agropyron combination. Legumes Intraspecific hybridization with pea, vetches, lupin, and clover is being carried out. The clover Mos-1 has been released as a standard for Moscow province. Potato In productivity tests seedling 157-3 and Snezinka [Snow Flake] 33 and 35 did well. Sunflower In varietal trials, Saratovskii [Saratov] 188 was the most productive. Some 27 inter-varietal hybrids obtained from natural cross pollination were tested. Other crops The experimental programme includes work with perennial flax, sweet sorghum and millet. The use of vegetative grafting in overcoming incompatibility in hybridization of distant forms has been studied. Yellow Acacia, pea, Cyphomandra and tomato were the experimental plants. Repeated grafting of pea on Acacia stocks has resulted in no changes in the eighth pea seed generation. Stavropolj Experimental Field for Perennial Crops Work has been concerned with the production of distant rye, wheat and sorghum hybrids. The problems of sterility and brittleness of the ears in hybrids have been overcome. Wheat Amphidiploids of Agropyron-wheat hybrids have been produced which are hardier, more productive and with larger grain than their parental forms. Perennial forms have been obtained. Rye Perennial rye has been obtained by crossing winter rye with wild perennial rye. Pending the results of State Tests the rye is being used for forage. Sorghum Perennial sorghum has been obtained from the cross between sweet Sorghum x wild gumai sorghum. Breeding it as a cereal continues. The present form produces up to 16% sugar and does well on sandy soil of semi-deserts of the Stavropolj Territory, where it grows 2-5 to 3 m. above the ground. Other crops Breeding is in progress of perennial vetchling, vetch and Jerusalem artichoke. Lysenko's theory of phasic development is being applied to several horticultural plants. Subsidiary Base for Distant Hybridizaiion of Wheat of the Timirjazev Agriculiural A cademy The report of the work of this Station is presented by A. P. Zebrak. Wheat Over 100 amphidiploids have been obtained by colchicine. The disease resistant Triticum Timopheevi was used as a component in all crosses, as a result of which the hybrid offspring has certain undesirable characters. These could be eliminated through selection. Crosses between the amphidiploids and T. vulgare soft wheats have given a variety of forms. This method is expected to cancel out T. Timopheevi genomes. Crosses are being made between the hard and soft wheats. As a result 70-chromosome amphidiploids have been obtained. The amphidiploids are being studied. The study includes the crosses between the amphidiploids of winter habit and amphidiploids of the spring habit type. Dokucaev Institute of Agriculture for the Central Black Earth Belt Study of open cross pollination is in progress. It has been found that the method does not yield heterotic forms, but that the hybrids become increasingly productive. Wheat Four new winter wheats have been obtained in the above manner, including Stepnaja [Steppe] 135 which at the Mironovskaja Station has outyielded Ukrainka [Ukrainian]. Four spring wheats have been selected and are undergoing tests. Rye Two promising rye varieties have been selected from naturally cross pollinated ryes.

These tendencies can be offset by infusions of fossil fuels for fertility, pest control and traction, but only partially and not over the long term. This could be called the ""problem of agriculture,"" in contrast to problems in agriculture. Natural ecosystems are unmatched for efficient nutrient recycling, solar energy use, and biodiversity preservation, but they cannot feed dense human populations. An ecological agriculture that is a synthesis of natural and agricultural systems can save soils from erosion and reduce chemical and water use. Reducing chemical pollution of air, water and soils will conserve wildlife habitat, improve water quantity and quality and protect human health. By practicing an agriculture that has conservation as a direct result, farmers can become better stewards of the land. Lower input costs and inherent sustained soil fertility will mean more profit for farmers and communities. Principles of natural systems agriculture (NSA) are applicable to any food- or fibre-production system worldwide. In the central Great Plains of the United States, agriculture should mimic the native prairie, which is a polyculture of herbaceous perennial plants. The Land Institute has spent 25 years studying the structure and function of prairies. Now we and other research organizations are breeding perennial grain crops, including cool- and warm-season grasses, legumes and composites. We are following two parallel strategies: selecting wild perennials for greater seed production and other traits of domestication and hybridizing wild perennials with annual crops to combine desired traits.

The results show that more Si was extracted by plant and ratoon crops of rice combined than by phosphate solution because of longer extraction time during plant growth and also because of possibly greater efficiency of Si removal by rice roots. Rice seedlings extracted proportionately more native Si than did phosphate solution, which resulted in comparable amounts of applied Si being recovered by the two methods, i.e., 8 to 30% for rice and 13 to 23% for phosphate extraction. The results of this study show that 55 to 72% Si applied 5 years ago was still adsorbed by or precipitated in the soil in a form that these techniques could not measure.

Since these crops may be grown in rotation, it is important to know if slag applied to one crop will benefit the second crop. The objective of the study was to determine the response of rice and sugarcane grown on a Terra Ceia muck (Euic, hyperthermic Typic Medisaprist) to calcium silicate slag applied prior to planting rice, and to slag applied before the planting of sugarcane. Five rates of slag were applied for production of a rice crop, after which time the same plots were planted to sugarcane. Other plots received the same rates of slag just prior to planting sugarcane. Slag applications increased both rice straw Si and sugarcane leaf Si concentrations. A single application of slag prior to planting rice increased production of both the rice and sugarcane crops in the rotation. The combined plant and ratoon rice grain yields were significantly increased 50% by slag application. Slag application also increased harvested cane (biomass) yields 23%, and sugar yields by 25%. Somewhat greater sugarcane plant responses were observed from slag applied immediately before planting than from slag applied before the rice and cane rotation treatment. On the average, slag applied at 20 Mg ha−1 before rice increased sugar yield by 16%, compared to a 21% increase when slag was applied before cane.","1987","2015-06-04 01:27:19","2015-06-04 01:29:21","2015-06-04 01:27:19","531","","3","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presently, grain sorghum is being ratooned for a second grain crop but production practices for the ratooned crop are not well defiled. To evaluate the effects of fertilizer N and insecticides on the production of ratooning grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), field studies were conducted for 2 years on a Greenville soil (Rhodic Paleudult). Nitrogen (0 to 157 kg/ha) was applied immediately after the first crop was harvested and a combination of insecticides was applied just prior to heading and during the early bloom stage. Nitrogen uptake, grain size, grain yield, and insect population counts were used to determine treatment effects. Leaf N increased with increasing N application rates in 1977. Grain yield did not increase when applied N exceeded 112 kg/ha. Average weight per hundred seed for all treatments was 1.6 g compared with an average of 2.7 g for the planted seed. Insect infestation was high in 1977 and yields of the ratooned crops (averaged over N rates) were 2,210 and 1,383 kg/ha for the insecticidetreated and untreated areas, respectively. In 1978, leaf K ranged from 1.4 to 2.0y0 and increased with increasing N rates up to 67 kg/ha. Weight per hundred seed averaged 2.22 and 2.91 g for the insecticidetreated and untreated areas, respectively, but did not respond to applied N. Although insect monitoring revealed no evidence of high densities of phytophagous insects, grain yield averaged 67% higher when insecticides were applied. Yield increased with increasing N rates up to 67 kg/ha in the insecticide-treated area but there was no response to applied N when insecticides were not applied. When averaged over N rates, yield from the insecticide-treated and untreated area in 1978 was 3,136 and 1,882 kg/ha, respectively. Total grain yield from the planted and ratooned crop (with optimum N and insecticides) in 1978 was 9,847 kg/ha. Data from this study suggest that 67 kg/ha of N fertilizer is sufficient for ratooned grain sorghum; the applied N will be economical if a well managed insecticide program is followed.","1981","2015-06-03 04:57:01","2015-06-04 07:36:37","","298-300","","2","73","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","WOS:A1981LP16000013","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Substantial infestations (>5.6 stem borers/m2) remained in rice culms regardless of cutting height (20 vs. 40cm). However, the 20-cm cutting height reduced E.℗ loftini infestations by 70–81% whereas D.℗ saccharalis infestations were not affected. Plant dissections showed that compared to D.℗ saccharalis larvae and pupae, relatively more E.℗ loftini immatures are located high in rice plants (>20cm from the base of the culm). In October, the ratoon crop was more infested with stem borers than the unmanaged main crop stubble during the first year of the study. The opposite was observed during the second year. Differences in unmanaged main crop stubble phenology between the two years likely caused these differences in infestation levels. During the post-growing season, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble decreased over the winter. After favorable winter conditions, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble did not differ, attaining 3.3 E.℗ loftini/m2 and 0.4 D.℗ saccharalis/m2 by March 2008. In March 2009, rice stubble harbored 0.3 E.℗ loftini/m2 and 0.2 D.℗ saccharalis/m2 regardless of whether only a main crop or a main and ratoon crop had been produced.

The influence of main crop total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) and main crop N topdressing on ratoon crop yield of four contrasting field-grown rice cultivars were evaluated in Texas during 1988 and 1989. Allowing panicles to develop normally or removing the upper two-thirds of each main crop panicle 10 d after initial main crop beading created a range in TNC of the culm and leaves during later stages of main crop development for determining TNC effects on ratooning. Nitrogen applied 10 d after initial main crop heading corrected any possible N deficiency, but did not increase main crop yield, TNC, or ratoon crop yield, indicating no benefits to N applied immediately after main crop beading. During main crop grain filling, culm and leaf TNC levels of plants with normal panicles decreased to low levels (0-90 g kg-1), then gradually increased and ranged from 40 to 170 g kg-1 at harvest. In contrast, TNC in culms and leaves of plants with incomplete panicles gradually increased during main crop grain filling reaching 140 to 310 g kg-1 at main crop harvest. Main crop plants with elevated TNC levels produced ratoon yields up to 5.3 Mg ha-1, averaging 48 and 33% higher than plants with low TNC at main crop harvest in 1988 and 1989, respectively. These data illustrate a moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.66) between ratoon yields and TNC in culm and leaves at main crop harvest for effects due to years, panicle removal, and cultivars.","January 1993","2015-06-03 02:04:03","2015-06-04 12:35:33","","150-153","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND93034208&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","carbohydrates; crop yield; cultivars; double cropping; filling period; heading; nitrogen fertilizers; Oryza sativa; ratooning; stems; Texas; top dressings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ratooning provides higher resource use efficiency per unit time and per unit land area. However, better yield of ratoon crop is possible by adopting appropriate management practices for main crop as well as for ratoon crop.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of  main crop harvest cutting height on ratoon crop agronomic performance, yield, and yield  components. The ratoons of both a semidwarf and non-semidwarf southern U.S. long-grain rice  cultivars were evaluated in the field for two growing seasons for response to main crop harvest  cutting height. Main crop plants were harvested at a cutting height of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and  0.5 m above the soil surface. The semidwarf cultivar had 7 and 40% higher grain yields than the  taller cultivar in the main and ratoon crops, respectively. Ratoon plant height and days to 50%  heading were numerically different for the two cultivars, but the same in proportion to their main  crop traits. Reduced cutting heights delayed ratoon maturity by up to 4 d, but had minimal  effects on ratoon plant height. No interactions between cutting height, cultivar, and/or year were  found for ratoon yield or yield components. Highest ratoon yields were obtained at cutting  heights of 0.2 to 0.3 m. Increasing cutting heights had little effect on ratoon panicle number per  meter squared, but significantly decreased in number per panicle, which led to decreased ratoon  yields at the highest two cutting heights. The results show that proper main crop harvest cutting  height can increase ratoon yields, but selecting a cultivar with inherent ratooning ability is  also essential to successful rice ratooning.","1993","2015-06-03 04:11:54","2015-06-03 10:05:31","","1139-1142","","6","85","","AGRON.

A systematic study of the life history and population dynamics of this insect was conducted during the 2002 growing season at the Louisiana State University Rice Research Station, Crowley, Acadia Parish, LA, an area where it is a particularly severe pest. By monitoring weevil populations using collections from overwintering sites, from plots of rice planted throughout the growing season, and from light traps, and by dissecting collected weevils to assess the conditions of their fat bodies, flight muscles and ovaries, we concluded that a portion of the weevil population in Louisiana is univoltine, another portion is bivoltine, and another portion may pass through multiple generations if young rice is continually available. However, only one generation of weevils developed in a single rice field. Adult weevils invaded rice fields in apparently large numbers prior to flooding. Weevils possessing both well-developed ovaries and well-developed flight muscles were found in both light traps and rice plots, suggesting that adults were capable of seeking new habitats by flying if rice plants were not suitable for oviposition. Weevils were able to complete a generation on ratoon-crop rice. The emergence of overwintered weevils started in late March, with peak emergence occurring during April and May. Return to overwintering sites began in early June and continued until October. Weevils appeared to move among overwintering habitats. A comparison of weevil population dynamics in rice plots planted on different dates supported the use of early planting as a management strategy.","2004","2015-06-03 04:10:42","2015-06-03 10:20:42","","623-642","","4","39","","J.

However, their inclusion in farming systems is limited by poor seedling vigour, thought to be associated with greater allocation of biomass to perennating organs in roots, and poor adaptation to some soils and climatic conditions in south-western Australia. For this reason, interest in other perennial options such as perennial wheat is increasing. In this research we compared early (29-day) seedling growth and root : shoot ratios for annual and perennial medics (Medicago truncatula and M. sativa), and for annual and perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum x Agropyron cross). For the medics, the annual reached the 6-leaf stage after 29 days and produced more root and shoot biomass than lucerne (4-leaf stage after 29 days), but there was no difference in root : shoot ratio or depth of root growth. For wheat, there were no differences in root growth, shoot growth, or root : shoot ratio between the annual and perennial lines (Zadoks growth stages 23 and 21, respectively, after 29 days). The poor competitive performance of M. sativa seedlings relative to M. truncatula was not due to changed allocation of biomass to shoots, but was related more to seed size (2.7 and 5.0 mg, respectively). This does not seem to occur to the same extent in perennial wheat lines, suggesting that their seedling performance may be more competitive.","2011","2015-06-03 03:18:12","2015-06-03 10:30:06","","367-373","","5","62","","Crop Pasture Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Agropyron; ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); annual variation; Australia; biomass allocation; Farming system; growth rate; lucerne; Medicago; Medicago sativa; Medicago truncatula; Perennial crops; perennial plant; phytomass; relevant; root-shoot ratio; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; secondary salinity; seedling vigour; SPV; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science; Wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These effects were measured on a gravelly Alfisol with a compacted subsoil horizon for three tillage methods (zero tillage, conventional tillage and reduced tillage, consisting of chiseling in the row zone once a year) and two cropping sequences (pigeon pea-maize and continuous maize). The root development was related to changes in soil physical and chemical properties. At all times overall root growth was in the order of zero tillage &gt; reduced tillage &gt; conventional tillage. Among zero-tilled plots, maize root growth in plots sown to a pigeon pea-maize sequence was greater than in plots sown to continuous maize. Macroporosity of the gravel layer, measured as soil water content at 0 kPa in the 500–600 mm depth, was not affected by cropping sequence. Among tillage systems, soil water content at 0 kPa was 18.9, 11.8 and 13.9% on a volume basis for zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots, respectively. Soil physical properties above the gravel layer were improved in the order of zero tillage &gt; reduced tillage &gt; conventional tillage.

Further selection was therefore made on these strains for grain size and plants showing the effects of inbreeding were discarded. Combinations are also to be made with other strains of selfed rye from which it is hoped to obtain the long desired high-yielding, short strawed rye. The results show that it is possible to produce a self-fertile rye which is completely immune to the bad effects of inbreeding, and the next step is the production of autogamous strains. Crosses between Petkuser rye and the perennial Secale montanum anatolicum to combine the perennial habit with the qualities of cultivated rye are also being made and from the progeny it has been possible to select strains without the brittle rachis and small grains of the wild rye.

The study was aimed to screen 68 of rice genotypes that have ratoon traits from 68 genotypes, to determine the selection criteria for ratoon rice and to determine the performance of selected genotypes in tidal land. The experiment was designed in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replicates. Each genotype was planted in four rows of 5 m long with spacing of 20x20 cm with 20 days old seedling. Each hill was planted with one seedling. Plants were harvested 32 days after heading by cutting at a height of 10 cm from the soil surface. One day after harvest, the land was irrigated as high as 3 cm and sown Urea 50 kg ha-1, TSP 30 kg ha-1 and KC1 25 kg ha-1. Of the 68 genotypes tested, the highest nine at ratoon genotypes were tested in tidal acid sulphate soil in a RCBD with three replicates. The results showed that there was a variation of ratooning ability among genotypes tested with regard to yield of ratoon. Culm diameter of main crop had highest significant direct effect to yield of ratoon. Genotypes of IPB97-F-13-1-1, IPB107-F-14-4-1, IPB107-F-14-5-1, IPB Batola 6R, Inpago IPB 8G, IPB 4S, IPB BATOLA 5R, IPB 3S and IPB107-F-18 were able to produce at least 7.5 g/hill of Dry Milled Grain (DMG). The ratoon of these genotypes produced the yield of at least 40% from the main crop, showed good performance and possessed similar harvesting period. Further, the ratoons of IPB97-F-13-1-1, IPB107-F-14-4-1, IPB 4S and IPB 3S produced 1.55, 1.60, 1.53 and 1.53 t ha-1 of DMG in the acid sulfate soil, respectively.

However, Oryza spp. cannot be screened in the field as is done for cultivated rice (O. sativa) because the plant canopy does not favor disease development and many plants drop mature seed. Thus, a growth chamber-greenhouse method of screening Oryza spp. and their early generation progeny is needed. Primary-secondary and ratoon tillers of rice cultivars-germplasm which ranged from moderately resistant to very susceptible were evaluated first for sheath blight susceptibility. Plants were inoculated by placing R. solani-colonized toothpicks at the leaf collar, then incubating plants in a growth chamber. After 7 days, plants were visually rated for sheath blight severity, and the lesion length of each leaf was measured. Ranking of cultivar-germplasm susceptibility by visual rating of primary-secondary tillers corresponded to the ranking from field ratings. Visual ratings correlated best with combined lesion length of the second and third leaves. For ratoon tillers, visual ratings correlated best with second-leaf lesion length. Next, this method was used with ratoon tillers to evaluate sheath blight susceptibility of 21 Oryza spp. accessions and F 1 progeny from crosses between 17 accessions and cultivated rice. This method proved useful on a limited scale for screening germplasm that could not be evaluated under field conditions.","2002","2015-06-03 04:10:57","2015-08-28 03:46:01","","808-812","","7","86","","Plant Dis.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND23334786&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ALL(ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Cultivation; Diseases; full text unavailable; Fungi; Genes; Germplasms; Hyphomycetes; Oryza; Oryza sativa; Plants (botany); ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rhizoctonia; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Thanatephorus cucumeris; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","canopy; cultivars; disease course; disease resistance; germplasm; greenhouse production; length; methodology; Oryza; Oryza sativa; plant genetic resources; screening; Thanatephorus cucumeris; tillers; wild relatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C. partellus generations overlapped, and all developmental stages were present throughout most of the summer (November-March). The borer completed two and a half generations per season. The first generation occurred during October-November, infesting only early grain sorghum tillers from a ratoon crop. C. partellus produced an additional one and a half generations on the commercial crops that emerged later. In March-April, fifth and sixth instars of the third generation entered diapause in the dry stalks. During the second part of August, the larvae started to emerge from diapause and all had pupated or emerged as adults by October-November. Diapausing larvae were present during most of the year. An increase in the proportion of young larvae indicated an increase in the population, and an increase in the proportion of pupae indicated a decline. Infestation by borers started on the funnel leaves and then moved down in the stalks as the season progressed. The majority of winter larvae diapaused in the lower parts of stalks. Pupal parasitism generally peaked at 100% and this corresponded with a decline of the first-generation larvae. The most abundant pupal parasites were Dentichasmias busseolae Heinrich at Brits, and Pediobius furvus (Cahan) at Warmbaths. Larval parasitism lagged behind peak larval populations and peaked at 80% parasitism. The most abundant larval parasite of C. partellus was Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron). Most recorded parasites are indigenous to Africa and their association with the exotic C. partellus is relatively new. Although they reduced densities of C. partellus, parasites did not reduce densities below economic damage levels.","April 1992","2015-06-03 02:04:44","2015-06-03 10:06:15","","518-529","","2","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND92041086&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; ratoon* N5 sorghum; relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","Chilo partellus; Ichneumonidae; parasites; Pediobius; population density; seasonal variation; South Africa; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second generation of L. striatellus adults emerged in forage maize fields in July, after harvesting of winter crops of barley, oats, and Italian ryegrass. These results suggest that spring crops of forage maize are important hosts of L. striatellus from spring to early summer. The overwintering generation of L. striatellus was collected from rice ratoon, suggesting this is a favorable host for L. striatellus during winter.

Half-hourly averages of carbon assimilation were obtained from tower-based conditional sampling (CS), and Qi was measured with quantum sensors. We found a high correlation between half-hourly averages of CO2 exchange rate (CER) and Qi.

The daily Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange (NEE) showed a seasonal variation with a maximum uptake rate of 39 g CO2 m−2 day−1 in late July when the leaf area index of the rice reached its peak. Daily NEE turned positive, indicating emission from the paddy, about 2 weeks before harvest, because of the declining photosynthesis rate of rice in its mature stage and enhanced ecosystem respiration from the drained paddy. Quantum yield of the primary crop showed a declining seasonal trend from 0.11 mol CO2 (mol quantum)−1 in the early growth stage to below 0.05 mol CO2 (mol quantum)−1 after heading. The ratoon crop had little effect on the seasonal CO2 budget of 2002, because its growing period was restricted to 1 month. The paddy field acted as a CO2 sink for about 100 days from late May until the end of August, indicating that the paddy field functioned as a source of CO2 for more than 70% of the year. The ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to ecosystem respiration (Re) was 1.53 for the primary crop period and 0.43 for the ratoon crop period. Drained days accounted for as many as a half of the primary crop period days and the ratoon crop period was restricted in length, thus we obtained small ratios of GPP to Re in the two periods. During the post-heading period, the half-hourly CO2 storage below the flux measurement height was occasionally comparable in magnitude to the eddy CO2 flux over the canopy. When the friction velocity was less than 0.1 m s−1, the storage term accounted for 6% of NEE on average even after influence of temperature on nighttime NEE was removed. Estimating the storage term from a single height measurement underestimated it by 22%.","December 14, 2005","2015-06-03 03:07:34","2015-06-04 12:42:09","","93-109","","1–4","135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon exchange; Eddy covariance; Paddy field; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, if they are harvested by ratooning or by picking the pods, the plants go on to produce a second flush of pods, which matures around March. In experiments conducted in four growing seasons at ICRISAT Center, second harvest yields were usually greater for non-ratooned than ratooned plants, and in experiments conducted on Vertisols they were greater for the plants ratooned high up in the plant than for those cut closer to the ground. Second harvest yields of non-ratooned plants without irrigation on Alfisols were on average 66% of the first harvest yields, but on Vertisols only 37%, in spite of the greater water-holding capacity of the latter. On Alfisols second harvest yields were approximately doubled by a single irrigation, but there was less response to irrigation on Vertisols. The poorer second harvest yields on Vertisols may have been due to the damaging effects of soil cracking on the root system of the plants. In non-ratooned plants from which the first and second flushes of pods were harvested together, yields were less than the total yield obtained from non-ratooned plants in two harvests, even though the yield loss, mainly due to pod shattering, was as little as 4% in one year. The taking of second harvests from pigeonpeas grown on Alfisols may have considerable potential as a method of obtaining additional yield for little extra cost.","1985","2015-06-03 03:06:28","2015-06-04 12:42:30","","323-332","","0","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 (cajanus OR ""pigeon pea"" OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); ratoon* W/5 (cajanus OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR ""pigeonpea"" OR ""pigeon pea""); relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ratoon grain yields of both cultivars were not significantly (P<0.05) affected by main crop seeding rate, row spacing, or seeding rate X row spacing interaction. Increased seeding rates significantly increased ratoon panicles per square meter (P< 0.01) and decreased ratoon filled grain number per panicle (P<O.O1) in all tests for both plant types.

We grew tetraploid S. bicolor, F-1 hybrid (BC0), and two backcross generations (BC, and BC,) in a randomized block design to examine total biomass, seed yield, and allocation to plant parts within and across generations. Root, rhizome, stem and leaf, and total biomass decreased from the BC, to BC, to S. bicolor generations, whereas panicle mass, seed mass, and reproductive allocation were lowest in the BC0 generation (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Mean seed mass (g.plant(-1)) was 39.1 in the BC0, 107.3 in the BC1, 84.1 in the BC2, and 92.7 for the S. bicolor parent, which translated into yields of 171.9, 471.6, 396.7, and 407.5 g.m(-2), respectively. Reproductive allocation varied from 14.7% in BC0 to 28.9% in BC2 compared with 33.5% in S. bicolor. Mean allocation to rhizomes was 2.71% in BC0 but negligible in BC1 and BC2. There was no relationship between rhizome mass and seed mass within any generation, but there was a positive correlation between total plant mass and rhizome mass in BC0. We divided the BC0 population into four groups with respect to rhizome production and found no significant differences among the groups in plant size or seed yield. Within each generation, reproductive allocation was inversely related to culm mass. The lack of an apparent trade-off between allocation to rhizome versus allocation to seed within any generation supports the possibility of combining within a population high seed yield and production of perennating belowground organs.","APR  1994","2015-06-03 04:21:02","2015-06-03 10:16:14","","468-474","","4","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1994NN38200008","","","","relevant; search.grain; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the feasibility of a perennial crop of Lesquerella is not clear because increases in seed-yield tend to reduce perennially. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of the source-sink ratio on seed yield and yield components in annual and perennial species of Lesquerella. We predicted that (i) due to differences in allocation patterns of annual and perennial species, seed-yield and yield components in perennials would be less affected by the source-sink ratio (higher stability) than in annuals and (ii) since seed-weight has been found to be the most stable yield component in other crops and their wild relatives, most of the variation in seed-yield as a consequence of source-sink ratios would be determined by changes in the number fruits per plant and the number of seeds per fruit. A field experiment was carried out in Chubut, Patagonia Argentina in a complete randomized design with four treatments to examine source-sink relationships in four species of Lesquerella, two annuals (L. angustifolia, L. gracilis) and two perennials (L. pinetorum, L. mendocina). We used either shading (reduction of source) or removal of flower-buds (reduction of sink) to develop a range of source-sink relationships. All four species showed a similar yield response to source-sink variations. Seed-yield was lower in shaded plants, although the timing of shading influenced this response. Flower-bud removal resulted in a significant increase in seed-yield. Seed-yield differences among source-sink treatments were best explained by changes in the number of fruits per plant than by the number of seeds per fruit. Source-sink manipulations had no affect on seed weight. Flower-bud removal significantly increased the number of fruits per plant in all species except for L. mendocina. The number of seeds per fruits increased only in L. pinetorum. Our results show that carbon stored during pre-anthesis plays a key role in reproduction both in annual and perennial Lesquerella. The increase in the seed-yield components found with bud removal could potentially reduce longevity in perennial species. The results also show that the number of fruits per plant is a good proxy for seed-yield within a species.","2011","2015-06-03 03:18:00","2015-06-03 06:40:31","","1393-1398","","2","34","","Ind.

Cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains varied considerably depending on the year and level of fertilizer and a large number of years and fertilizer levels were required to estimate the ripening ability. Cultivar differences in the ratoon volume varied largely depending on the ripening stages and appeared clearly at the early and late stages every year or at the intermediate stage in certain years. Cultivar differences in the ratoon volume at these ripening stages appeared clearly for every year and every level of fertilizer application, unlike the percentage of ripened grains. In each experiment at the early, late and intermediate ripening stages, correlation coefficients between the ratoon volume and the percentage of ripened grains for different fertilizer levels were generally low or high without clear or with clear cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains and the correlation coefficient for the level at which cultivar differences were most clearly revealed, was higher than +0.7 in each experiment. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between the ratoon volume for fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains could not be revealed and the percentage of ripened grains for fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences were most clearly revealed, were higher than +0.7 in most of the cases. Based on these results, it was considered that the ripening ability could be easily selected based on ratoon volume at the ripening stage even for low fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains did not appear clearly. Secondly, using F 3 pedigree lines derived from the crossing of two cultivars, a selection experiment for ripening ability based on the ratoon volume at the early ripening stage was conducted for 2 generations at a low fertilizer level. Inter-line differences in the ratoon volume and percentage of ripened grains were both significantly large and the correlation coefficient between the two characteristics was significantly high in the F 5 selected lines. Based on these results, it was considered that the simplified method of selection for ripening ability based on the ratoon volume was effective in rice breeding.","2004","2015-06-03 04:49:04","2015-06-03 04:49:04","","49-56","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20083078591","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One practice, ratoon-cropping, may increase productivity and reduce per-unit production costs associated with conservation tillage farming systems in tropical and subtropical regions. sorkam, a dynamic plant growth model for grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], was used to evaluate the potential of rainfed ratoon grain sorghum over diverse climatic regions of Texas. Eleven independent data sets collected in the U.S.A. from sites in Georgia and Texas were used to determine the model's accuracy. The model produced realistic estimates of grain yield for planted, ratoon, and combined (planted + ratoon) crops. Simulated grain yields usually were within 25% of the observed yield for the planted, ratoon, and combined crops with cultivars that produced the highest ratoon grain yield at each location. Ratoon grain yield results of multi-year simulations (10–30 years) from 14 locations over the eastern half of Texas using historic, location-specific, meteorological data indicated that the probability of obtaining ratoon grain yield &gt; 3.0 Mg/ha was confined to the upper coastal plain region of Texas. The area best suited for rainfed ratoon grain sorghum appeared to be confined south and east of a line running from west of Corpus Christi to Beeville to College Station to west of Center, Texas. Use of crop models can play an important role in identifying strengths and weaknesses of potential cropping systems when used in combination with historical climatic data and/or computer weather generators.","August 1988","2015-06-03 03:08:29","2015-06-04 12:51:23","","63-74","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALL(ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); crop models; diverse environments; ratoon grain sorghum; ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.sorghum; simulating grain yield; SPV; tropical and subtropical regions; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); USA, Georgia; USA, Texas; Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) sponsored a joint project from 2004 through 2009 to study the feasibility of developing and conserving water to provide sufficient water to farmers in the Lower Colorado River basin, while allowing transfer of water to the city of San Antonio. A major focus of the project was the development of a web-based rice water conservation analyzer (RiceWCA) to evaluate field- and regional-level costs, water savings, and yield benefit associated with implementing on-farm conservation measures, including precision leveling, multiple inlets, conservation tillage, lateral improvement, tailwater recovery, and a production system based on growing high-yielding water efficient cultivars. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the crop development and water balance components of RiceWCA. RiceWCA uses a phenology model to time water management events, including flushing and flush drainage for the main crop, and permanent flood, flood maintenance, and drainage before harvest for the main and ratoon crops. RiceWCA simulates daily water balance for each rice field within the Lower Colorado River basin, as affected by the degree of implementing different conservation measures. The water balance model includes site-specific estimation of soil saturation deficit, evapotranspiration, percolation, seepage, rainfall, irrigation, and tailwater. The water balance model was calibrated and verified using 2000 and 2002 weekly irrigation records for the Lakeside and Gulf Coast irrigation districts, and validated using 2001, 2003, and 2004 weekly irrigation records. Tailwater recovery offers the largest water saving, followed by adoption of high-yielding cultivars, multiple inlet systems, precision leveling, and conservation tillage. Water saving from lateral improvement varies depending on the extent of existing laterals.","December 2012","2015-06-03 03:07:26","2015-06-04 13:37:35","","66-82","","0","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conservation tillage; Lateral improvement; Multiple inlet; Precision leveling; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Tailwater recovery; Water balance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified soil moisture, lysimeter NO3 leaching, soil labile C accrual, and grain yields in the first 2 yr of a perennial grain crop under development [kernza wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey] relative to annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under three management systems. Overall, differences between annual and perennial plants were much greater than differences observed due to management. In the second year, perennial kernza reduced soil moisture at lower depths and reduced total NO3 leaching (by 86% or more) relative to annual wheat, indicating that perennial roots actively used more available soil water and captured more applied fertilizer than annual roots. Carbon mineralization rates beneath kernza during the second year were increased 13% compared with annual wheat. First-year kernza grain yields were 4.5% of annual wheat, but second year yields increased to 33% of wheat with a harvest index of 0.10. Although current yields are modest, the realized ecosystem services associated with this developing crop are promising and are a compelling reason to continue breeding efforts for higher yields and for use as a multipurpose crop (e.g., grain, forage, and biofuel).","MAY-JUN  2013","2015-06-03 04:20:03","2015-06-03 09:51:04","","735-744","","3","105","","Agron.

A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha-1, and rice straw at 5 t ha-1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss. Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but FYM significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39. 1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with FYM mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with FYM and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semiarid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil.","NOV  1992","2015-06-03 04:18:04","2015-06-03 10:22:49","","195-215","","2-3","25","","Soil Tillage Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:A1992JZ80600007","","","","Alfisol; ALL((""long duration"" OR ""long-duration"" OR perennial) W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon pea"" OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Erosion; erosion control; India; India, Hyderabad; (""long duration"" or perennial) W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR ""pigeonpea"" OR ""pigeon pea""); mulching; raindrop detachment; relevant; Runoff; runoff reduction; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; semi-arid tropic; Soil management; SPV; Tillage; TS=((""long duration"" OR perennial) NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shanyou 63 was carried out in cement-bottomed plots. The plots were drained 15, 25 and 33 days after full heading, which coincided with mid-summer drought in Chongqing, and re-irrigated 15 days after harvesting the main crop. Daily mean temperature and relative humidity in the plant canopy and at 2/3 of plant height from the ground showed a highly significant negative correlation both in the drainage treatments and in the undrained control, r ranging from -0.765 to -0.831. Soil moisture decreased with the advancement of drainage. Organic matter, soil pH and total N, P and K were all lower in the drainage treatments. Drainage 15 days after heading gave fewer green leaves remaining on the stalk, lower grain weight, seed-setting rate and yield/plant and shorter buds; however, the plants matured earlier, and the bud at the 5th node from the top was longer than in the other treatments. The ratoon crop in this treatment had poorer plant establishment, and lower panicle-forming percentage, bud utilization rate and panicle-to-shoot ratio, giving a yield of 1178 kg/ha as compared with 1438 and 1936 kg/ha for the other two treatments and 2573 kg/ha for the control. The soil moisture in the three treatments during drainage averaged 34.3%.

Any particular farmer best appreciates the specifics of managing his or her own crop and paddock combination, such that interaction with researchers may diminish once the general principles of crop and plant performance are understood. In dryland farming, however, there is a great deal of `slack' in the linkage between principles and practice. This situation has been addressed with the development of soil and crop monitoring tools that provide the specifics of a crop and paddock which can be linked to the principles of system performance using a simulation model. The output generated by a crop simulator enables researchers to contribute usefully to discussions of crop management with farmers. Actual and simulated experience are compared and combined, leading to enhanced appreciation by the farmer of the degree of exposure to risk that he faces in making management decisions. This would be expected to enhance the farmer's ability to make decisions that improve productivity and profit. Sorghum occupies a major niche in many semiarid subtropical farming systems due to its generally low cost of production, and its ability to respond to favourable seasons with high yield. The sorghum crop is flexible, providing vital soil protection both as a standing crop and as postharvest residue, and it is also valuable forage. Even in a situation where the price of cotton can give a gross return 3 times higher than sorghum on a crop-for-crop basis, sorghum holds a strong position because of the lower risk involved in both establishing and protecting the crop. Sorghum has a growing season that is one third shorter than cotton and it consumes proportionally less soil water resources, and also provides substantial protective residue whereas the recommendation for cotton fields is postharvest cultivation to reduce the survival of resistant pests. Sorghum presents the possibility of a ratoon crop which provides prolonged soil protection and takes advantage of spring rainfall, especially in the northern grain belt, where the `gain to rain' ratio is likely to be higher for the ratoon crop than the primary crop. On-farm cropping research enables a systematic assessment of the different levels of risk associated with substitutable crops. The equivalent of many years of farming experience can be accumulated, using advanced tools for monitoring and simulation. This approach contributes to valuable learning when researchers and farmers interpret simulator outputs in a discussion group that pays heed also to their personal experience.","1996","2015-06-03 04:55:47","2015-06-03 04:55:47","","63-77","","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19970700849","","","","relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of this it is now possible for every locality to cultivate only those varieties that are adapted to it-the State Variety Testing Service is testing over 2, 000 Soviet and foreign varieties of 125 different crops at 400 different stations. Breeding methods are being fundamentally changed so as to form a complex system involving the co-operation of physiologists, phytopathologists, entomologists, chemists and technologists. The more important achievements in the form of improved new varieties are reviewed. Special mention is made of the use of wild fruit trees in hybridization by Michurin, of the hybrids of wheat by rye of Meister and others, the production by interspecific crossing of wheats of the vulgare type having the hard durum grain, of perennial wheats from crosses with Agropyrum, of fertile amphidiploids between a number of species giving sterile hybrids and of sugar beet x mangold hybrids with increased yield. Special reference is also made to the discovery of new species of wheat and potatoes and the valuable practical results that are already beginning to accrue therefrom; also to the valuable results obtained from artificial curtailment of the length of day in many southern forms of both herbaceous plants and trees. Special new methods, suitable for use by breeders, have been elaborated for determining the cold and drought resistance and other physiological properties of the plant, extensive tests have been carried out with success on vernalization, special attention has been devoted to quality in nearly all crops, and the areas of possible cultivation of a great number of crops, notably cotton, have been extended by the production of improved forms. Collections have been made of the cultivated plants of the whole world, the wild fruit trees having proved to be specially interesting and important, the centre of origin of most European fruit trees having been shewn to be in Transcaucasia and Central Asia, including parts of Persia and Turkey. A thorough study of these areas is being executed. Great numbers of new plants have also been brought into cultivation, including the valuable new rubber plant tau-saghiz, which yields a rubber of the first quality. The application of cytogenetics has led to the production of polyploid forms of certain small bush fruits with increased berry size. Similarly Pangalo's studies on the cucurbits have made known the extent and the interrelationships of this large group for the first time, by classifying the whole world collection and separating out the most valuable types, and by crossing with species themselves not distinguished by high sugar content twofold increases in the sugar content have resulted.","1934","2015-06-03 04:21:48","2015-06-03 10:31:01","","5-23","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600066","","","","relevant; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For wetland rice, additional studies were conducted to determine the feasibility of ratoon cropping in increasing the productivity of rice. Furthermore, the different seedling ages were used in the experiment with wetland rice to determine the feasibility of reducing field duration. The dibbling method produced higher grain yield than the other methods for dryland seeding, and the drilling method for wetland seeding. The normal tillage operation gave grain yield similar to that obtained with intensive land preparation. During both dry and wet seasons two split applications of nitrogen fertilizer produced the same grain yield as the placement of nitrogen in the reduced soil layer. For the dry season, the optimum seedling age for the early-maturing varieties was 20 to 30 days, and for the medium- and late-maturing varieties was 30 to 40 days. But for the wet season planting, the optimum seedling ages for all varieties were 20 to 30 days. Seedling ages of the main crop had no effect on the grain yield of the rice ratoon crop. Deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer to the main crop gave a higher grain yield in the ratoon crop compared with split application. Higher grain yields were obtained from the rice ratoons from the late-maturing varieties. The grain yield of the rice ratoon crops ranged from 28 to 34% of the main crop. The maturity of the ratoon crops varied from 53 to 68 days after cutting the main crops depending upon the variety.","1980","2015-06-03 04:54:21","2015-06-03 04:54:21","","112-116","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093019589","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dead eggs in the first group are considered to be caused by mal-influence of low temperature through their mother adult. The latter are presumed to be influenced directly by the cold conditions at the egg stage. In the fallowing paddy field, the egg population on the ratoon paddy increase from December. The population peak is observed in the middle of January. Most of those eggs hatch in the middle of February. Then, the temperature condition is no longer serious to the newly hatched nymphs. Therefore the survival rate of the nymph are surely high. They are recognized to be the first generation of planthopper of the year. The low temperature seems a mechanism regulating the embryonic development of brown planthopper during winter season. As a result, the hatching of overwintering eggs are concentrated in the middle of February.

The results revealed that the immigration of brown planthopper in the initial stage of the first rice crop in most cases could not be traced due to low immigrant. The first generation adults used to appear during the end of April to the beginning of May, and the hopper took about one month to complete one generation up to the time of harvest of the crop in the end of June. The highest population peak in this crop season ranged from 0.60 to 10.2 with an average of 1.33 per hill, which appeared mostly during 1-2 weeks before harvest of the crop. Analysis of the factors affecting to abundance of the hopper in the first rice crop indicated that the density of over-winter population was the most important (r2 = 0.984). Besides, the number of days with the lowest day-temperature below 10.degree.C during December to Match, and the number of rainy day in April were also the factors affecting the population abundance to a certain extend. On the contrary, the population of the hopper in the second rice crop was high. The immigrant invaded into paddy fields soon after rice planting, and the peak of immigration appeared mostly during 2 to 3 weeks after rice planting. Initial population was varied from year with a range from 0.006 to 0.27 female adults per hill. The population increased from 46.6 to 2071 folds through 2 to 3 generation's multiplication to reach its highest population peak in the range of 0.6 to 450.6 per hill. The population abundance of the hopper in this crop season was highly correlated with the density of immigrant and the rainfall in September. High temperature over 34.degree.C in August was also an important factor in reducing the population abundance in this crop season. Several regression equations has been established for predicting the population abundance of the hopper both in the first and second rice crop in this area. The coefficience of determination of the regressions were higher than 0.986, indicating that they were likely to be used practically. The population characteristics of the hopper in each crop season and on ratoon rice in this area are also discussed in the paper.","1990","2015-06-03 04:52:13","2015-06-03 04:52:13","","1-26","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199090074036","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The practical purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether “preferential pairing” occurs in artificially induced tetraploid F1 species hybrids ofS. cereale andS. montanum which are heterozygous for three translocated chromosomes. Under these conditions chromosomes might form bivalents rather than the multivalent rings and chains usually found, resulting in a normal degree of fertility. 2. Several individuals of the tetraploidF 1 generation, heterozygous with respect to three translocated chromosomes, showed the expected percentages of quadrivalents always found in tetravalent rye, all other chromosome associations were bivalent (group 1 in table 1). The remaining individuals investigated also produced fewer multivalents than theoretically expected on the basis of the model proposed by Linnert (1962) and extended by us to include translocation figures composed of three translocated chromosomes. 3. It is to be assumed that in all of the plants investigated cytologically the quadrivalents were formed by the chromosomes not involved in the translocations. 4. Since the fertility of individuals with a strong tendency to form bivalents (group 1 in table 1) was no higher than that of plants producing a rather high percentage of multivalents, the rather high proportion of bivalents cannot be attributed to “preferential pairing” between chromosomes with increasing degrees of homology. Instead, it should probably be assumed that in the plants in question chiasma frequency was extremely low, so that heteromorphic bivalents instead multivalents were produced. 5. Proof of “preferential pairing” by cytological methods alone is rather difficult, because of the necessity to correctly distinguish the heteromorphic bivalents from the normal ones. It is discussed how use of the structural difference of chromosome VI ofS. montanum as compared to chromosome VI ofS. cereale which we detected recently, may serve to overcome this difficulty. 6. It appears that the goal of breeding a perennial, fully fertile, high-yielding rye hybrid may be achieved much more easily in diploids than in tetraploids, for in the tetraploid species hybrid success depends upon the selection not only of genotypes with high heritability for chiasma frequency but also for “zig-zag” distribution of the chromosomes involved in the formation of multivalents. In spite of our failure, a continued search for true “preferential pairing” may lead to its discover.","1970-03-01","2015-06-04 03:50:32","2015-06-04 03:51:03","2015-06-04 03:50:32","99-105","","3","40","","Theoret.

As panicle number of the ratoon rice crop depends on the effective tillers of the previous crop and on the activity of axillary buds on mother culms, the optimum population is 350 000 effective tillers/mu at most. For a crop which is to be ratooned, it is essential to raise strong seedlings with 2 or more tillers/plant at a sowing rate of 10-20 kg/mu and to transplant the seedlings at the 7- to 8-leaf stage. It is recommended that fertilizer applications to the rice nursery be 20-30% higher than the usual rate. The optimum spacing is 23.1 * 13.2 to 20 * 20 cm with 2-3 seedlings/hill. In transplanted paddy fields, organic manure should be increased by 40%. Field management is very important for high yield of both the rice crop and its ratoon crop in the period from 1 month before to 1 month after harvest. Harvesting should be done at 90% maturity to stimulate growth of the axillary buds. The optimum cutting height is about 20 cm.

Kuprijanov (1922 to 1926) has long been cultivated in mountainous parts of North Caucasus and from here was evidently introduced into Turkey and Armenia by immigrating natives (1864). It is valued for its relative earliness among other perennial rye forms, and its compact and vigorously tillering bush of prostrate shape. It retains green stems and leaves at full grain maturity, thus being of particular value for forage and pasture. Low drought resistance, prolonged maturation, susceptibility to fungi and fragility of ear lower its quality as a grain crop. Winterhardiness is still to be ascertained. Individual selection has given good results, namely, forms with simultaneous maturation of grain, and spring and highly drought resistant forms. High self-fertility of S. Kuprijanovi makes it easy to split populations into sections. As it crosses readily with other annual and perennial ryes, further improvement of 5. Kuprijanovi is thought to be possible through hybridization.

To understand the underlying reasons for this variation, we used multiple regressions for the variables SGR and survival rate, using the results of eight experiments in such polycultures at the Co Do rice-fish experimental station. The SGR of C. carpio declined with increasing rice density. Interspecific competition with O. niloticus also had a negative effect on C. carpio SGR. When fertilizer or manure is added to the trench of the rice-fish field or when extra food can be given to the fish, O. niloticus seems more appropriate than C. carpio. The survival rate of C. carpio depended on season, C. carpio stocking weight and density and the biomass of wild fish species. To obtain higher survival rates, one should stock fewer fish but of a larger size, after thorough eradication of wild fish species.","2004","2015-06-03 04:10:47","2015-06-03 04:10:47","","171-177","","2","35","","Aquac.

The lines included were: AT3425 (putatively Triticum aestivum * Thinopyrum ponticum [ Elymus elongatus]), BFPMC1 ( Thinopyrum intermedium [ Elymus hispidus]), Permontra ( Secale cereale * S. montanum), PI-368149, PI-368150 ( Triticum turgidum * S. montanum), Spitzer, TA12252 ( S. montanum) and Varimontra (reselection of Permontra). Two seeds were planted into one-inch balls of moistened soil collected from SBWMV- and WSSMV-infested fields or a mixture of both soils (for co-inoculation). Two dozen soil balls per genotype per soil inoculum were planted into microplots of previously non-infested soil confined by fibreglass barriers at Tailby field, Ithaca, New York, USA in October 2001. Plants were inspected for virus-like symptoms in May, September and October 2002. All genotypes, except Spitzer, were considered to be at least moderately susceptible to one or both viruses based on the observation of typical disease symptoms in some inoculated plants. ELISA was used to confirm visual symptoms observed in May 2002. For SBWMV, ELISA confirmed infection of AT3425, PI-368149, TA12252 and Varimontra. For WSSMV, ELISA confirmed infection of AT3425 and Permontra. ELISA also confirmed co-infection of AT3425, BFPMC1, Permontra, PI-368149, PI-368150, TA12252 and Varimontra by SBWMV and WSSMV. None of the singly inoculated plants were co-infected. Strikingly, co-inoculation resulted in increased infection by both viruses. No symptoms were observed during autumn 2002, even though autumn temperatures were similar to those that were conducive for symptom development in the spring. No plants, whether infected by virus or not, survived the following winter for unknown reasons. The results suggest that perennial small grains are at risk for infection by soilborne viruses and that resistant cultivars may be needed for management of these diseases.","2005","2015-06-03 04:20:36","2015-08-31 17:18:20","","1-2","","November","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20053222106","","","http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND43806089&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","AGRICOLA; full text added; perennial N1 grain; relevant; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","disease resistance; Elytrigia intermedia subsp. intermedia; Elytrigia pontica; hybrids; intergeneric hybridization; lines; perennials; Secale strictum subsp. strictum; soil-borne diseases; Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum; wheat; Wheat spindle streak mosaic virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an incremental step towards dissecting the genetics of perennialism, a segregating F4 heterogeneous inbred family derived from a cross between S. bicolor and S. propinquum was phenotyped in both field and greenhouse environments for traits related to over-wintering and rhizome formation. An unseasonably cold winter in 2011 provided high selection pressure, and hence 74.8 % of the population did not survive. This severe selection pressure for cold tolerance allowed the resolution of two previously unidentified over-wintering quantitative trait locus (QTL) and more powerful correlation models than previously reported. Conflicting with previous reports, a maximum of 33 % of over-wintering variation could be explained by above-ground shoot formation from rhizomes; however, every over-wintering plant exhibited rhizome growth. Thus, while rhizome formation is required for over-wintering, other factors also determine survival in this interspecific population. The fine mapping of a previously reported rhizome QTL on sorghum chromosome SBI-01 was conducted by targeting this genomic region with additional simple sequence repeat markers. Fine mapping reduced the 2-LOD rhizome QTL interval from similar to 59 to similar to 14.5 Mb, which represents a 75 % reduction in physical distance and a 53 % reduction in the number of putative genes in the locus.","JAN  2013","2015-06-03 04:32:46","2015-06-03 10:29:27","","153-162","","1","31","","Mol.

The variety used in the study was Xianyouming 86, a super high-yielding rice. Results indicated that yield was most closely related to spikelet number per panicle in the first season, and this yield factor contributed most to yield. In the ratooning season, yield was most closely related to panicle number, which was the main contributor to yield. Super high-yielding ratooning rice had larger sinks [than lower yielding varieties?], not only in the first season but also in the ratooning season. The sink volume made a greater contribution to yield than did seed setting. The contribution of total spikelet number per unit area to yield was higher than that of grain weight. The contribution of spikelet number per panicle to total spikelet number per unit area was higher than panicle number per area in the first season, and in the ratooning season this was the other way round.

This high potential arises out of the combination of cool temperatures and long photoperiods which favours the prolonged interception of solar radiation by extending the duration of the leaf canopy. In practice, realisation of this potential depends primarily on soil water conditions, which, in turn, determine dates of planting and harvesting, thereby delimiting the actual, as distinct from the potential, growing season. The fitting of the new crop to the actual growing season, or the development of strategies to avoid or tolerate the effects of wet soils in spring and autumn must therefore be primary aims in the selection of new varieties or species for Scotland. Four possible approaches, each of which has been used with success elsewhere, are reviewed, namely : the empirical approach, agrometeorological modelling, the adoption of perennial crops, and the use of crops yielding products of high value. Although at least three of these strategies have received attention over the last decade, only the empirical approach has had a significant influence on the proportions of species grown in Scotland (changes in areas of winter cereals, oilseeds and peas). It is concluded that, to date, crop physiology has contributed very little to the formulation of new cropping systems. However, crop physiology has made an important contribution in the interpretation of high yields at higher latitudes, pointing to a new set of arable energy crops for the next century, when supplies of fossil fuels will dwindle. In the meantime, investment in the development of such crops will depend upon policies for the pricing of fossil fuels and the use of surplus arable land in the EC.","1993","2015-06-03 02:29:01","2015-06-04 13:11:57","","161-171","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alternative crops; crop physiology; daylength; full text unavailable; perennial W/1 grain; relevant; ScienceDirect; Scotland; search.grain; soil water relations; SPV; Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Botanical considerations point clearly to the retention of perennial characteristics while archaeological and historical evidences point to cultivation with more than a single harvest from an initial planting – the practice of ratooning.

In 1949, preliminary work was begun on the physiology of perishing in the vegetative organs in annual grasses. Two annuals (Hostianum 237 winter wheat, and Tarasanskaja winter rye), and 2 perennials (cultivated rye and wild rye, Secale anatolicum) were grown. The leaf lamina, leaf sheath and internodes were studied in regard to changes in vitality and water content (estimated, visually, by change in colour from green to yellow and by relative turgidity) at different stages of seed ripening, namely, 14 June (beginning of seed setting), 3 July (wax ripeness), 11 July (full ripeness), and 4 August (over-ripeness). For economy of space the data obtained are given (in tables) only for Hostianum 237 and wild rye. The figures are discussed in relation to the transfer of nutrient substances from the vegetative organs to the seeds, with special reference to the fact that the perennials are reproduced by seeds and by vegetative reproduction, whereas the annuals are reproduced by seeds only. Dying-off in perennials is characterized by two phases of perishing in the leaves. The first coincides with the onset of seed setting and takes place in the lowest leaves of the stem, proceeding (as in annuals) from the base upwards; the second coincides with seed filling and ripening, but starts in the upper leaves, and proceeds downwards. It is concluded that this characteristic of the perennials may be useful in selection studies.-M.H.","1951","2015-06-03 04:38:53","2015-06-03 04:38:53","","1037-50","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19521700604","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deep ripping and roller compaction were used to establish three compaction treatments which represented the range of conditions observed in commercial fields. Trials were conducted with and without irrigation over two growing seasons (1984/1985 and 1987/1988). Growth restrictions resulting from compaction were primarily related to reduced water uptake resulting from decreased infiltration and storage of water, and restricted root growth. Seasonal conditions, in particular the distribution of rainfall, exerted a strong influence on plant response. Yield reductions resulting from compaction varied from 100% in a very dry season to 0% in a wetter season. The reduced impact of compaction in the wetter season was associated with reduced levels of soil strength during early root growth and a decreased reliance on stored subsoil water for growth. The effects of seasonal conditions on plant response make it difficult to predict the yield reduction likely to result from compaction and to identify a critical level of compaction when ameliorative measures are required. A modelling approach is required to assist in the prediction of yield reductions resulting from compaction and to identify seasonal conditions under which yield losses are likely to be most severe.","July 1992","2015-06-03 03:06:15","2015-06-04 13:36:58","","107-127","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); relevant; ScienceDirect; search.wheat; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fourteen sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) cultivars were evaluated in a ratoon double-cropping system at two locations during 1980 and 1981. Significant cultivar × location interactions were detected both years. Environmental conditions (particularly air and soil temperatures) and genetic capability governed performance of cultivars in the ratoon cropping system. The Coastal Plain location provided a more stable environment for ratoon cropping of sorghum than the Piedmont location and this production dependability was attributed to warm temperatures during April–May and October–November coupled with at least 230+ frost-free days. Total whole-plant green weights were 36% higher in the Coastal Plain than in the Piedmont. Percent sugar concentration was 15% higher on the first crop and 9% higher on the ratoon crop in the Piedmont than in the Coastal Plain. Calculation of total sugar yield per hectare revealed that the cultivars produced 43% more sugar when grown in the Coastal Plain than in the Piedmont. Roma was the best cultivar in the Coastal Plain while Brandes, Wray, and Keller were the best cultivars in the Piedmont. MN 960 and Ramada should be avoided when ratoon cropping. Insect damage was significantly greater on the ratoon crop than on the first crop. Fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)) larvae caused the major foliar damage on the ratoon crop. Genetic improvements are needed in sweet sorghum cultivars used in ratoon cropping to increase total plant weight productivity (especially on the ratoon crop), sugar accumulation in the stem (particularly on the first crop), tillering capability in the ratoon crop, germination and seedling vigor in cool soils, and disease and insect resistance.Key words: Sorghum bicolor (L.)

[Methods] In 2010-2011, the population occurrence and dynamics of S. fuercifera were systematically studied in the field using light-trap collection in six major rice growing areas in Yunnan, including the west, southwest, south, southeast, east, and northeast. [Results] The results show that the size of the overwintering population was smaller than in other seasons and its distribution was different in six major rice farming areas of Yunnan; mostly concentrated on rice stubble, ratooning rice and rice seedlings in wet paddy fields at latitudes south of N 23 degrees 55'164 '' and altitudes below 1 369 m. Moreover, the overwintering population of S. furcifera in the south and southeast of Yinman was more abundant than that in the west and southwest. Light-trapping indicated that the beginning of the migration period of S. furcifera was from early March to late May in the west, early March in the southwest, and middle to late May in the northeast. The migration period of S. furcifera was progressively later from the west to the southwest, south, southeast, east, and northeast. Adult numbers captured by light-trapping were lower in the southwest than the southeast and the peak immigration dates were mainly in May, June and July. The return migration peak occurred from late September to middle October. Population peaks occurred in the southwest and south from the end of April to June, in the southeast and east from late May to early July, and in the northeast from late June to July.

That idea, however, contains a fatally weak point, when we consider the tremendous difficulty for primitive human to seed any cereal crop in the warm and humid climate, where weed thrives all year round. Instead of the accepted theory, we have to see a reality that vegetative propagation of edible plants is a dominant form of agriculture in such regions. The possibility is discussed that Job's tears and rice, two cereal crops unique to the region, might have been developed via vegetative propagation to obtain materials for medicine or herb tea in backyard gardens prior to cereal production. This idea is supported by the fact that rice in temperate regions is still perennial in its growth habit and that such backyard gardens with transplanted taro can still be seen from Yunnan Province of China to Laos. Thanks to detailed survey of wild rice throughout China for 1970–1980, it is now confirmed that a set of clones of wild rice exist in shallow swamps in Jiangxi Province, an area with severe winter cold. In early summer ancient farmers may have divided the sprouting buds and spread them by transplanting into flooded shallow marsh. Such way of propagation might have faster improved less productive rice through a better genetic potential for response to human interference than quick fixation in seed propagation, because vegetative parts are heterogeneous. Obviously, such a primitive manner of rice cultivation did include the essential parts of rice farming, i.e., nursery bed, transplanting in flooded field of shallow marsh like. Transfer from the primitive nursery to true nursery by seed may have later allowed rice cultivation to be extended to northern regions. In thus devised flooded cultivation there were a series of unique advantages, i.e.; continuous cropping of rice in a same plot, no soil erosion, slow decline of soil fertility, availability of minerals, and resulting in high yield per unit area, which have collectively attained the highly productive cereal cultivation in the warm and humid region. Rice cultivation in marsh is also favorable to raise fish culture, both of which constituted a nutritionally balanced base. Development of irrigation technology to construct flooded farms gave strong bases for stable rice-cultivating society, which in the end formulated the rise of ancient kingdoms of Yue and Wu in China in BC 6th -5th centuries. They were direct descendents of those people who had developed the unique rice cultivation from the era of Hemudu culture, which is dated back to 5 000 BC. Their movement to the south is considered to have established rice-cultivating communities in South China and Southeast Asia, while to the north it transferred the rice-based technology to ancient Korea and Japan and had established there a base for a civilized society.","September 2007","2015-06-03 02:28:23","2015-06-04 13:17:51","","161-171","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ancient kingdom; full text unavailable; perennial habit; perennial W/1 grain; primitive agriculture; relevant; rice and fish farming; ScienceDirect; search.grain; spread of rice cultivation; SPV; sustainable cultivation; vegetative propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The provision of forms suitable to more northerly cultivation in particular is likely to be achieved by this means and special reference is made to the perennial wheat produced by hybridizing with rye-grass. The same is now being done for fruit trees. Twenty species of small bush fruits not hitherto used either as fruit or for crossing have been collected at Hibiny. In Siberia all possible kinds of temperate fruits are found and these are not damaged by the frost. Michurin has made use of all these forms, many of them for direct introduction and all of them for hybridization. Whole forests of interesting forms of common fruits, hitherto untouched by the breeder, exist in Transcaucasia and other countries. Many of these are resistant to frost or to drought. Similar forests of walnut, pistachio and other nuts occur in the Central Asiatic republics of the Soviet Union and these, as well as a number of subtropical fruits, are being used by Michurin, whose breeding work has made possible the cultivation in northern regions of all kinds of fruits that would not have been even considered previously. Michurin's method consists of crossing forms of widely different geographical origin-the wild vines, pears, almonds, etc., of the Far East were crossed with the high-quality varieties of Europe and America-or crossing forms of very different genetic constitution, i.e. interspecific and intergeneric hybridization. Species and genera that will not cross are first united vegetatively at as early an age as possible or else crossed by means of an intermediate form. By this means he has produced over two hundred new varieties of fruits and other plants. At present he is evolving frost-resistant peaches for the central area of the U.S.S.R. and the Crimea. In apples he has evolved sorts that not only grow in such regions as Voronesh but come into bearing at the end of 5-6 years and are of superior quality and flavour. In whole areas of central and northern U.S.S.R., Siberia and the Urals, fruit growing has been made possible as a result of this work. Attention is now being devoted also to the production of artificial mutation. In 1934 fifty thousand hybrid seedlings were growing at Michurin's station and 948 combinations were made, involving the pollination during that year of 205, 057 flowers artificially and 463, 942 by means of bees. Mass hybridizations were made at other places too, 150, 000 flowers being cross-pollinated at the Moscow station, 80, 000 at Leningrad, and 600, 000 at others. At present four thousand growers are using Michurin's varieties and sixteen thousand hectares will be under them in the second Five Year Plan.","1934","2015-06-03 04:46:05","2015-06-03 04:46:05","","16-22","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600772","","","","relevant; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A. glaucum, A. trichophorum, A. elongatum and A. junceum gave a high percentage of success in crossing with soft and hard wheat. A. repens in early experiments failed to cross with wheat, but later forms were found which cross readily. As the systematics of Agropyron are not yet complete, the forms in question may represent a new Agropyron species. In the F 1 generation, the characters of Agropyron are dominant; all the hybrids are perennial and show an equal tendency to generative and vegetative reproduction. Most of the F 1 plants are self-sterile, only individual groups being self-fertile. B. A. Vakar found that the number of chromosomes of the self-fertile hybrids equals the sum of the haploid number of the parental forms. Reduction division of wheat * A. elongatum is quite normal, twenty-eight bivalents being formed; reduction division in wheat * A. glaucum hybrids is associated with such serious meiotic disturbances that the extent of self-fertility is surprising (Vakar). Some F 1 plants segregate, whereas others remain constant. As the majority of F 1 generation was self-sterile, back crossing to one of the parents was required; the percentage of success did not exceed 3 to 4 per cent. Natural cross-pollination in mixed sowings of hybrids and wheat was more successful. From the F 2 generation onwards, segregation gave rise to various forms, some with characters not found in the parents. The percentage of perennial plants fell somewhat in the F 2 generation, and in subsequent generations varied according to the type of parent; the percentage of perenniality in F 4 plants varied from none to 60 or 70. In F 5 and subsequent generations a number of valuable annual and perennial forms could be selected. Some vigourous forms, for example, wheat * A. elongatum hybrids, with many tillers are of particular forage value; perennial wheats are for grain and forage purposes. The length of the vegetative period in F 1 plants is determined by the type of wheat: Agropyron * spring wheat yielded spring hybrids and Agropyron x winter wheat, winter hybrids. The vegetative period of forms intermediate between wheat and Agropyron varies with the year. In the first year three groups are found, namely, forms with long vegetative period (120 days or more), forms not fully earing in the first year and forms not earing in the first year.

Although they were highly sterile, a few seeds were obtained from cross pollination. After repeated backcrossing onto wheat, plants of the F4 generation are only 1% perennial. Better results were obtained by using winter wheat with high regenerative ability, and by crossing F1 hybrids with relatively fertile, perennial plants of later generations. Among the plants of the F2 generation, 30 to 35% are sterile, and with a few exceptions grains of the fertile plants have no commercial value. In the F3 generation, particularly after intercrossing between F2 hybrids, a relatively high proportion of perennial plants with wheat-like grains was obtained.

Now, diversification of these cropping systems is emerging as a strategy for sustainable intensification, potentially increasing both crop production and resource conservation. In temperate zones, diversification is largely based on the introduction of winter-annual and perennial crops at spatial and temporal locations in annual-crop production systems that efficiently increase production and resource conservation. Germplasm development will be critical to this strategy, but we contend that to be feasible and efficient, germplasm improvement must be closely integrated with commercialization of these crops. To accomplish this integration, we propose a novel approach to germplasm development: the reflective plant breeding paradigm (RPBP). Our approach is enabled by developments in genomics, agroecosystem management, and innovation theory and practice. These developments and new plant-breeding technologies (e.g., low-cost sequencing, phenotyping, and spatial modeling of agroecosystems) now enable germplasm development to proceed on a time scale that enables close coordination of breeding and commercialization (i.e, development of cost-effective production systems and supply-value chains for end-use markets). The RPBP approach is based on close coordination of germplasm development with enterprise development. In addition to supporting strategic diversification of current annual-cropping systems, the RPBP may be useful in rapid adaptation of agriculture to climate change. Finally, the RPBP may offer a novel and distinctive pathway for future development of the public plant-breeding programs of land-grant universities with implications for graduate education for public-and private-sector plant breeders.","2014","2015-06-03 03:16:48","2015-06-03 21:04:44","","1939-1948","","5","54","","Crop Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; search.wheat; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimum temperature for infection by the nematode was 28 to 30°C., but the range of 27 to 28°C. was also very favourable, indicating that in tropical countries D. angustus finds suitable conditions for infection throughout the year. The soil conditions of rice paddy fields during fallow were ideal for the growth of nematodes but laboratory tests and the ecto-and euparasitic nature of D. angustus showed that soil transmission was impossible but survival of the eggs in the soil cannot be disregarded. The disease is spread mainly by nematodes in irrigation water and control methods should concentrate on eliminating other Oryza spp. which are the alternate hosts of D. angustus. Where Oryza is absent, infection is spread by ratoon rice plants and the remains of diseased plants. It is recommended that the rice be cut low, all stubble buried, crop remains burnt and all ratoon plants eliminated.

C, respectively. Each female laid 59.5 and 20.0 eggs at 30.degree. and 20.degree. C, respectively. S. spinki emerged during early May. Its population increased to a high level between Aug. and Oct., and declined until harvest. In the winter they survived in the stubbles and ratoon rices until late Feb. of the next year. The greater the planting density of rice, the higher the population of rice tarsonemid mite. The varieties of lower infestation were Chianung seen No. 11, Tainung No. 67, Kaohsiung sheuan No. 1 and Taichung sen No. 5; those of higher infestation were Kaohsiung sen No. 2, Taichung sen No. 2 and Tainan No. 5. Rice plants infested with S. spinki showed a significant increase in sterility rate and decrease in panicle neck. Rice tarsonemid mite was the main cause for the occurrence of empty head of rice plants. Predatory mites occurred all year. A protozoa parasitized each instar of the rice tarsonemid mite. The highest percentage of parasitism occurred in Oct. All recommended paddy field pesticides were highly toxic to the natural enemies of S. spinki, and had little effect on the S. spinki. This is probably why the rice tarsonemid mite has increased in recent years.","1980","2015-06-03 04:54:14","2015-06-03 04:54:14","","1-10","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI198172016185","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies using these approaches indicated that tree (Gliricidia sepium and Grevillea robusta) and crop (Zea mays) roots predominantly occupied the same soil volume, implying there was little spatial complementarity, and highlighted the existence of considerable variation in tree root density between seasons. The less labor-intensive approach of determining the ""competitivity index"", based on measurements of main roots, was not a reliable indicator of competition unless it was adjusted for tree size. Fractal relationships provided reasonable estimates of coarse root length, but seriously underestimated the length of fine roots. Sap flow studies showed the marked capacity of tree root activity to switch from one part of the root system to others in response to changes in soil moisture availability, and highlighted the importance of root function as opposed to structure in determining the severity of below-ground competition; such effects may provide both benefits and costs to neighboring plants.

In Costa Rica, it is found in the northern region of the country, mainly in the wetland of the Medio Queso River, Los Chiles, Alajuela. It is diploid, of AA type genome and because of its genetic relatedness to cultivated rice it is included in the O. sativa complex. We describe the ultrastructure of leaf blade, spikelet, ligule and auricles. Special emphasis is given to those traits of major taxonomic value for O. glumaepatula and to those characters that distinguish this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. O. glumaepatula has a leaf blade covered with tombstone-shaped, oblong and spheroid epicuticular wax papillae. It has diamond-shaped stomata surrounded by spherical papillae, rows of zipper-like silica cells, bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 40 μm in length and small hirsute trichomes of ca. 32 μm in length. The central vein is covered with large, globular papillae of ca. 146 μm in length, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The border of the leaf blade exhibits a row of even-sized bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 42.5 μm in length. Auricles have attenuated trichomes of ca. 5.5 mm in length on the edges and small bicellular trichomes of 120 μm in length on the surface. The ligule has a large number of short attenuated trichomes on its surface of 100 μm in length. These latter two traits have important taxonomic value since they were found in O. glumaepatula but not found in O. sativa or in O. rufipogon. The spikelet has the typical morphology of the Oryza genus. Fertile lemmas have abundant spines, a trait shared with O. rufipogon but not with O. sativa. The sterile lemmas are wing-shaped with serrated borders, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. All the ultrastructure characters observed in O. glumaepatula from Costa Rica are also common to the specimens from Brazil.","2005","2015-06-03 03:26:58","2015-06-03 10:19:48","","15-22","","1-2","53","","Rev.

The asexually propagated plants were generally shorter than the seedling plants.","1961","2015-06-03 04:55:04","2015-06-04 08:10:45","","44-47","","(1/2)","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19623800007333","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing perennial upland rice and managing weeds using less herbicide are exciting new projects being pursued. Enhancing rice productivity is seen as an entry point to alleviating the interrelated problems of declining productivity, lack of sustainability, and poverty in the uplands.

Perennial grain crops could potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to result in plant types that differ substantially from all current domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes. We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with stable yield and tolerance to crowding.","OCT  2014","2015-06-03 04:19:54","2015-06-03 09:52:53","","1801-1819","","10","101","","Am.

These diverse species represent considerable genetic variability which can be utilized for the improvement of cultivated sunflower. The taxonomy of Helianthus is somewhat confusing due to the complicated natural interspecific hybridization and different ploidy levels of several species. A germplasm collection of 2000 accessions, mostly annuals, has been assembled. Interspecific hybridization has become important as a means of introducing genetic variability into the cultivated sunflower. This has been facilitated by the use of embryo culture and chromosome doubling with colchicine to increase fertility. The wild species continue to serve as a source of cytoplasmic male sterility for cultivated sunflower. Molecular techniques of restriction endonucleases of mitochondrial DNA can be used to differentiate CMS sources. The greatest impact the wild species have made on cultivated sunflower has been in the area of genes for disease resistance and, to a lesser extent, resistance to insects. The recent discovery of genes for high tolerance to the disease Phomopsis/Diaporthe helianthi Munt. Cvet. is an excellent example. Considerable variability has been reported in oil content and fatty acid concentrations in the wild species as well as agronomic and morphologic traits of plant height, days to flowering and tolerances to stress, especially salt.","September 1992","2015-06-03 02:30:07","2015-06-04 13:26:38","1992-10-02","195-230","","3–4","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","full text added; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.grain; search.sorghum; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the genomic probes, these lines were the same in that they all were allohexaploids (2n=6x=42) containing 30 wheat and 12 lymegrass chromosomes. The ribosomal gene mapping further identified species origin of the chromosomes, whereby the lymegrass parent was undoubtedly L. mollis and the wheat was likely to be a Triticum species having the AB genomes. This rDNA mapping was also able to reveal differences in the genome composition among these lines, and such differences were mainly in the wheat nucleolar organizing regions (Nor). The first line (M) had two Nor-B1 (1BS), the second line (G) had one Nor-B1 (1BS), two Nor-B2 (6BS) and two Nor-A1 (1AS), whereas the third line (U) had the same Nor loci as the second line but two sites each. The wheat ribosomal genes were variably expressed depending on the lines, but the lymegrass loci appeared inactive. All three lines had the same Nor loci belonging to L. mollis, two Nor-m1 and two Nor-m2. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the rDNA confirmed the identity of L. mollis parent in all three lines and verified the differences in the wheat ribosomal genes among them. These amphiploids were, however, similar in their restriction profiles, therefore indicating common origin. The molecular and cytogenetic evidence here suggested that these annual, fully fertile amphiploids that originated from the same crosses 40 years ago became genetically differentiated and fixed in stable forms.","1999","2015-06-03 03:19:51","2015-06-03 09:43:08","","1087-1093","","7-8","99","","Theor.

Characteristics showing diversity among populations included seed yield, plant height, growth habit, days to maturity, 100 seed weight, and shatter resistance. Eight characteristics were analyzed by principal components and cluster analysis. The resulting four clusters accounted for 56% of the variation among accessions.

Perennial grain crops offer a new solution to the long-standing problems of salinity and soil erosion associated with conventional cropping systems based on annual plants. Seed yield and its components (culm number, spikelet number per culm, seed set, seed weight) were measured in 46 accessions of Microlaena stipoides (microlaena, meadow or weeping rice grass) from Western Australia and New South Wales to quantify potentially useful variation in the species. A high degree of variability was found to exist, with a 20-fold range in seed yield (0.1-2.4 g/plant), 5-fold range in seed weight (129-666 mg per 100 seeds), 2-fold range in spikelet number (14-30 per culm), 8-fold range in seed set (12-98%), and a 5-fold range in culm number (11-59 per plant). Seed yield was positively and significantly (P<0.05) correlated with culm number, seed set, and seed weight (r>0.55 for all). No correlation was found between seed yield and spikelet number per culm (r=-0.14). The range in seed yield and its components suggests that there is sufficient variation within microlaena to make selections for higher yielding lines. This variation will enable breeders to exploit genetic diversity more efficiently and identify useful accessions for further work. High priority traits for future work include synchronous maturity and resistance to shattering.","2005","2015-06-03 03:19:22","2015-06-03 09:52:26","","309-316","","3","56","","Aust. J. Agric.

In response to these changes, waterbird numbers have declined or individuals have moved into modified or artificial habitats. Rice, a well-known artificial habitat for waterbirds in many rice-growing regions (Kushlan and Hafner 2000), is cultivated in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) and provides habitat for waterbirds. During the 1998 rice-growing season, 300 surveys were conducted in 14 representative rice fields. Objectives included determining the number and relative abundance of waterbird species in rice fields, impacts of temporal and spatial field condition on waterbird richness and abundance, and characterization of waterbird activities in rice fields. Forty-one species of waterbirds were observed in rice fields. Species richness at survey sites ranged from 12-28 and density ranged from 4.6 to 72.6 birds/min/100 ha. Species richness and overall abundance fluctuated in response to rice growth or harvest phase and field water levels. Significantly more wading birds and shorebirds were present in rice fields during water drawdown. Shorebird abundance was negatively correlated to water level and rice height. Waterfowl abundance was negatively correlated with cloud cover. Primary activity of all birds was foraging (63%), followed by resting (33%), walking or running (4%), and nesting (< 1%). Rice fields harvested twice (ratooned) provided additional water drawdown phases. Waterbird abundance may increase in the EAA with greater area devoted to rice fields and increased ratooning of existing fields. Effects of rice farming practices on waterbirds, including chemical use and harvesting methods, should be further evaluated.","FEB  2006","2015-06-03 04:48:30","2015-06-03 04:48:30","","9-20","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200600467827","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The monsoon-adapted ancestors of indica-like rice were readily gathered, whether unmanaged or managed through simple burning regimes, and as such might be expected to have long been gathered or cultivated without domestication. By contrast the perennial wetland rice that was ancestral to japonica necessitated more intensive forms of management, especially in terms of water regimes, for its productivity to be increased. This encouraged water-management systems that increased in complexity and labour requirements over time and can be linked to the evolution of domestication traits in Yangzte rice between 6000 and 4000 bc. The spread of rice from its Yangzte core seems to have occurred after the development of paddy-field cultivation systems. Meanwhile in India the spread of rice out of the Ganges towards South India, mainly after 1000 bc, may also have occurred only after more intensive irrigated systems of cultivation had developed. These are inferred from the archaeological weed flora of north India to have developed during the Chalcolithic to Iron Age (after 1400 bc). We suggest that the spread of rice, which has played an important role in models of Neolithic population dispersal in Southeast Asia, may have been triggered by the development of more intensive management systems and thus have required certain social changes towards hierarchical societies rather than just rice cultivation per se.","2009","2015-06-03 04:23:05","2015-06-03 09:56:35","","88-111","","1","41","","World Archaeol.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000263648700006","","","","Agriculture; ALL(perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); China; Cultivation; Domestication; hunter-gatherer; India; Iron Age; irrigation system; japonica; labor standard; Oryza sativa; Paddy field; Productivity; relevant; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; social change; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Water management; Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WIWS4HMV","journalArticle","1935","VAKAR, B. A.","Wheat-Agropyrum hybrids : a hylogenetic investigation.","Trudy prikl. Bot. Genet i. Selekcii. Ser.","","","","","Hybridization of soft and hard wheat with Agropyrum elongatum dates back to 1932. The characteristics of the male parent ( Agropyrum) were dominant in the F 1 plants. When sown in 1933 the derivatives were late and evidently self-sterile. In 1934 the hybrid plants eared abundantly and early and were crossed with A. elongatum (unsuccessfully) as well as with soft and hard wheats and annual and perennial rye. Although the florets pollinated have not as yet been analysed in detail, it is thought that their fertility is low. In 1933 Triticum durum plants were crossed with A. elongatum. Earing of F 1 plants sown in 1934 was scanty. The 1933 F 1 plants resembled the male parent and were awned. Thus they differed from the hybrids obtained in 1932. All crosses with A. repens were unsuccessful. It is noted that the hybrids of both series were all perennial and showed marked heterosis in height; as they could easily be propagated vegetatively, a large number of clones was obtained. The chromosome behaviour during meiosis in the F 1 hybrids of T. vulg are and A. elongatum, was followed. In the hybrids 2n = 56 and during meiosis either 14 bivalents + 28 univalents or 21 bivalents + 14 univalents were formed. In the second meiotic metaphase 28 chromosomes were counted in the dyads and this suggests that the bivalents and univalents are distributed in a regular way. The further development of pollen tetrads is abnormal; older pollen loses its cytoplasm and dies. In the F 1 hybrids of T. durum and A. elongatum, the chromosome number is 49. In meiosis either 14 bivalents + 21 univalents or 21 bivalents + 7 univalents are formed. In the second case the chromosomes segregate regularly and univalents divide equationally giving dyads with 28 chromosomes. The pollen tetrads are however usually irregular and pollen degenerates. Two types of special interest were observed during meiosis in T. durum lybicum 1606 x A. elongatum. 21 bivalents + 7 univalents were formed, but segregation was irregular; in another case meiosis took place in the pollen grain instead of the pollen mother cells, and viable dyadic pollen was produced. In self-fertile F 1 hybrids, 28 bivalents were observed. The pairing is allosyndetic when 14 bivalents are formed, but both alio- and autosyndesis occur, if the number of bivalents is 28. The hybrid proved to be most interesting cytologically and is discussed in great detail. Discussing the results of cytological investigation, the author suggests that the genom D in the presence of A and B determines the "" vulg are "" type of Triticum, while its presence in hybrids of T. durum and A. elongatum results in a greater similarlity of F 1 plants to the "" vulg are "" type than to the "" durum "" type. It is supposed also that the cause of self-sterility of the hybrids is not cytological, but rather genetical. On the basis of his own investigations and on those of others, the author concludes that A. elongatum and A. glaucum are closely related to the Spelta and Emmer series of Triticum. A. elongatum is probably distantly related to Aegilops, whereas its relation with S ecale, as well as with T. monococcum, is very remote.","1935","2015-06-03 04:39:47","2015-06-04 13:30:15","","121-61","","8","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19360701448","","","","relevant; search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (rye OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These findings lead us re-examine the past ideas about domestication and differentiation of rice. Historically, in 1930s two sub-species, indica and japonica, were proposed on the basis of sterility in F1 hybrids between them. Soon after that, the two types were classified by the associations of a number of genetically independent traits. The characteristic associations of traits have been explained by the hybrid sterility or reproductive barriers which were assumed to comprise a set of duplicate recessive lethal genes and to be an inner genetic mechanism to lead to the varietal differentiations. In 1980s, the hybrid sterility between Indica and Japonica types was analyzed, and Indica, Japonica, and wide-compatibility type which gives fertile hybrids when cross to Indica and Japonica types, are proved to contain an allele, S5i, S5j and S5n, respectively at a locus on chromosome 6. And those gametes having S5j allele are found to be partially aborted in the hybrid genotypes of S5i/S5j while no gamete abortion occurs in S5i/S5n and S5j/S5n genotypes. Since then, the gene S5n has been used in hybrid rice breeding to obtain fertile and vigorous hybrids between subspecies, and the long-disputed problem of hybrid sterility has been solved. Also in such studies the characteristic association of traits found in each of varietal groups is better explained by founder effects. On the other hand, a large number of native cultivars of rice were surveyed with enzyme polymorphism in 1980s and later with molecular markers. As a result, profound genetic diversity is found in cultivated rice as well as in wild rice. These findings seem to lead us to the idea of multiple independent domestications of rice. However, before reaching such a conclusion, at least two factors, i.e., long-distance-dissemination of some genotypes and the possibilities of introgression by local wild rice to primitive cultivars need to be examined. Taking the two factors as well as the historical events into consideration, it is considered here that the perennial japonica cultivars which are close to wild rice in the Changjiang River basin were disseminated to East India through Assam or along the Bengal Bay, where they were transformed under the introgressions of local wild rice and formed a secondary center, from which some genotypes seem to be disseminated to colonies in Southeast Asia under the influence of Hinduism. Later some of the genotypes were introduced into China and constituted so called Indica type. This may be a reasonable picture for the varietal differentiation.","March 2009","2015-06-03 02:43:53","2015-06-04 13:31:06","","1-13","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Domestication; full text unavailable; genetic diversity; geographical distribution, founder effect; hybrid sterility; Indica type; Japonica type; Oryza sativa; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); relevant; reproductive barriers; Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; varietal differentiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relative densities of Wolbachia within each individual were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and the result showed that the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus had the highest Wolbachia density. These findings indicated that Wolbachia are distributed throughout leafhoppers and planthoppers from Thailand, suggesting that Wolbachia dynamics in nature may be affected by ecological factors.","June 2015","2015-06-03 03:07:08","2015-06-04 13:31:34","","277-282","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Endosymbionts; Habitat; PCR; Quantitative; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); relevant; Rice pest; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Wolbachia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rice yield by using no fertilizer ones increased to the most significant level than some used fertilizer, and the ratooning rice and rice yield by using more N fertilizer decreased to the most significant level than less fertilizer ones. The rice yield by using some fertilizer increased to the most significant level than no fertilizer ones for mid-season +rationing rice and rice yield by using some fertilizer had no obvious differences at different nitrogen levels. Therefore, application of fertilizer can improve yield of mid-season rice and mid-season +rationing rice. Soil test results showed that nutrient contents in rice field in South Sichuan were very rich in nitrogen, which could provide more adequate crop growth potential soil nitrogen nutrition. The crops with a deep root system had stronger ability of utilization on soil nitrogen. Therefore, the ratooning rice used no or little N fertilizer had a high yield performance because they made full use of soil nitrogen with deep root system.","2009","2015-06-03 04:47:48","2015-06-03 04:47:48","","17-21","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20113096382","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accumulated area in five years was 1097.73 ha. The average yield was 10 664 kg/ha in the main season and 6537 kg/ha in the ratoon season. The super high-yield of the main crop depended on a stable spike number and large spike size. The yield had significant and positive correlation with total dry matter accumulation. The yield of the ratooning season mainly depended on more ratooning spikes. These originated for 35-40% of accumulated dry matter from the main crop stubble and for 60-65% from the photosynthetic production of leaves of ratooning rice. The key cultivation techniques for super high-yielding ratooning rice are using a suitable planting area, selecting the varieties with high-yielding and high ratooning power, regulating growth period, cultivating in ridge beds, optimizing fertilizer application and maintaining high rice stubble.","2003","2015-06-03 04:49:15","2015-06-03 04:49:15","","1-6","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20033162757","","","","relevant; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Far less attention has been focused on rice cultivars commonly grown in the Southern US. This 2-year study was conducted to determine the effects of [CO2] and air temperature on four Southern US rice cultivars. In 2000, ‘Cocodrie’, ‘Cypress’, and ‘Jefferson’ were grown season-long in five outdoor, naturally sunlit, controlled-environment chambers in constant day–night air temperature regimes of 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 °C under an elevated [CO2] of 700 μmol mol−1. In 2000, an additional chamber containing all three cultivars was maintained at 28 °C and an ambient [CO2] treatment of 350 μmol mol−1. In 2002, a more detailed study examining both main crop (MC) and ratoon crop (RC) yields was conducted with the rice cultivar ‘Lamont’ in these same chambers with day–night air temperature treatments of 19/15, 23/19, 27/23, 31/27, and 35/31 °C under an elevated [CO2] of 700 μmol mol−1. In 2002, an additional chamber was maintained at 27/23 °C and an ambient [CO2] treatment of 350 μmol mol−1. In the 2000 experiment, all the plants of all three cultivars in the 40 °C treatment died during early vegetative growth. In the constant 36 °C air temperature treatment, all three cultivars survived to produce panicles but failed to produce any seed yield. At the 28 °C temperature treatment, CO2 enrichment increased grain yield by 46–71% among the three cultivars with the cultivar Cypress being the most responsive to CO2 enrichment. In the 2002 experiment with the cultivar Lamont, plants in the 35/31 and 19/15 °C treatments survived to produce panicles but failed to produce any seed yield. In the 27/23 °C treatment, CO2 enrichment resulted in a non-significant increase in seed yield for the MC but more than doubled RC yields. Comparisons of these results with findings from prior studies on Asian indica and japonica cultivars indicate that these Southern US rice cultivars may be more sensitive to high temperature stresses during reproductive development than previously studied Asian cultivars. These results also point to the possibility of selecting or breeding rice cultivars with enhanced capability to take advantage of future global increases in [CO2].","April 20, 2004","2015-06-03 03:06:49","2015-06-03 09:44:45","","129-137","","3–4","122","","Agric.
