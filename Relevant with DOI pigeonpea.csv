To sustain soil productivity, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), a leguminous perennial crop was evaluated for its potential as a short duration fallow crop for fodder and grain, and maize (Zea mays) production. It involved comparing a natural fallow (i.e., control) and four improved fallows of pigeon pea pruned annually at 30 cm, 60 cm and 90 cm from the ground, and unpruned pigeon pea over a two-year period. After this time, the land was cleared manually and planted to maize. The highest mean annual biomass of pigeon pea over the two-year period of 6.1 t ha–1 dry matter (DM) was obtained by pruning at 60 cm. The highest leaf litter production and pigeon pea seed yield was obtained from the no pruning treatment. The mean maize grain yield from the improved fallow (3.02 t ha–1) in the first year after clearing was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than that of the natural fallow (1.54 t ha–1). Considering the biomass of pigeon pea from pruning, pigeon pea seed yield and maize grain yield after the pigeon pea, pruning pigeon pea at 60 cm is the most promising regime for crop-livestock production systems.<br /><br />Introduction<br />The northern Guinea savanna zone of Ghana is very important to the agricultural economy of the country because it produces the bulk of the country’s food crops and livestock (MoFA, 1991). Increasing human population in the zone has led to increasing pressure on the most important farm resource (land), thus giving rise to increased interaction between crop husbandry and livestock activities. The high pressure on land has resulted in shorter fallow periods, which are more resource demanding. This has affected crop and livestock production significantly, since the evolving systems are incapable of conserving soils against erosion and soil nutrient mining, thus resulting in<br /><br />deterioration of the resource base of the soil. There is also increasing demand for livestock fodder, both in terms of quality and quantity. Consequently, there is a need to identify cropping systems that allow continuous cultivation and/or short fallow periods on the same piece of land to provide food for human consumption and make available quality fodder to supplement livestock feeding.<br />Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) is an annual or perennial leguminous multi-purpose crop that can produce grain for human consumption, fodder for supplementary livestock feed, and mulch or green manure for soil fertility maintenance. The wood can be used for firewood, roof thatching and basket making (Gooding, 1962;<br /><br />198<br />Daniel and Ong, 1990). It is easy to establish from seed and grows well under the combined stresses of drought and poor soil fertility, which are the major constraints to crop production in the zone (IITA, 1986). The crop ratoons well and has deep rooting system and can as a result improve soil fertility through more efficient nutrient cycling through leaf litter production and biological nitrogen fixation (Nair, 1984). Pruning height is an important management tool that affects grain and fodder yield in pigeon pea (Akinola et al., 1975).<br />In the past, farmers in northern Ghana only cultivated pigeon pea as a border crop by planting it along the periphery of fields to demarcate boundaries. Through the joint effort of Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) and Animal Research Institute (ARI, 1997), the crop is now cultivated as a main crop for grain and fodder in the zone. However, information is limited on the potential of pigeon pea as a short duration fallow crop in smallholder crop-livestock systems in the region. The experiment was conducted to investigate the potential for pigeon pea as a short duration fallow crop in place of natural fallows to improve soil fertility, provide grain for food and fodder for livestock feeding.<br />Materials and methods<br />The experiment was carried out from 1996 to 1999 at the Savanna Agricultural Research Institute, Nyankpala (09°25′ N; 00°58′ W) in the northern Guinea savanna zone of Ghana. The zone experiences erratic annual rainfall of about 900– 1100 mm in a monomodal rainy period of 150–180 days from April–September. The soil was a welldrained sandy clay with slightly acidic reaction and low organic matter content (Adu, 1957). It is locally referred to as Tingoli series and Haplic lixisol (FAO-UNESCO, 1990).<br />The experiment was laid in a randomised complete block with five treatments in three replications. The treatments were: 1. Natural fallow 2. Improved fallow (two-year old pigeon pea) –<br />no pruning 3. Improved fallow (two-year old pigeon pea) –<br />pruned at 30 cm from the ground<br /><br />4. Improved fallow (two-year old pigeon pea) – pruned at 60 cm from the ground<br />5. Improved fallow (two-year old pigeon pea) – pruned at 90 cm from the ground<br />Each plot measuring 6 m × 4 m was planted to pigeon pea (cv. Kpatinga, a local variety that matures in seven months) on 26th July 1996 at a spacing of 40 cm between and within rows. The pigeon pea was pruned twice, at 13 and 56 weeks after planting (WAP), and the biomass recorded. Three 1 m × 1 m quadrats were randomly taken from each plot at 29 and 82 WAP to estimate the amount of litter (dry leaf litter production) on the surface of the soil. Pigeon pea pods were hand picked on 17th February 1997 and 1998 from the eight middle rows in each plot to estimate grain yield. In July 1998 all the pigeon pea plants were removed and the natural fallow cleared using a hoe. All the plots were then planted to an improved maize (Zea mays) cv. Okomasa (with a maturity period of 120 days) at a spacing of 75 cm between rows and 25 cm within rows. All plots were hand weeded at three weeks after planting maize and six weeks after the first weeding. Fertiliser was applied at a rate of 40 kg N ha–1, 20 kg P ha–1 and 20 kg K ha–1 after first weeding to all treatments. Maize was harvested from the six middle rows in each plot to estimate the maize grain yield. Maize cropping was repeated in 1999.<br />Composite soil samples made up of 24 subsamples were taken using a 2-cm diameter soil auger from 0–20 cm soil depth across all the plots before planting of pigeon pea in 1996 and from each plot before planting maize in 1998. The soil samples were analysed for pH, N, P, K and organic carbon using procedures described by IITA (1979).<br />Data were analysed using a General Linear Model (Statistix, 1996). Regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between pigeon pea pruning height and yield of pigeon pea fallow on biomass, litter production, pigeon pea seed yield, maize grain yield and soil nutrient status.<br /><br />Results<br />Soil fertility status before planting pigeon pea and maize<br />Mean soil pH (CaCl2), total N, available P, exchangeable K and organic carbon content at planting of maize in 1998 and composite soil data across all plots for the same soil parameters at planting of pigeon pea in 1996 are presented in Table 1. There was no significant difference between the natural and improved fallow or within the latter in 1998 in terms of N, P, K and organic carbon. In general there was an increase in soil acidic reaction (reduction in soil pH) over the twoyear period. There was an increase in soil total N, P and K over the two-year period as a result of fallowing.<br />Pruned biomass of pigeon pea<br />The biomass from the first pruning decreased linearly with increasing pruning height (y = 5.61 + 0.0458×; r = 0.99), while that of the second pruning showed a quadratic response (y = –2.85 + 0.3715× – 0.0027×2) with increasing pruning height with the highest biomass obtained by pruning at 60 cm (Figure 1). The total biomass followed the same trend as the second harvest, with optimum yield of 12.2 t ha–1 obtained at 60 cm pruning height above the ground. Significant negative correlations were established between first pruned biomass and pigeon pea seed yield (1996, r = –0.92; 1997, r = –0.96) and litter production (1997, r = –0.76; 1998, r = –0.83). The biomass from the first pruning positively correlated to maize grain yield (r = 0.80).<br /><br />199<br />Litter<br />The amount of leaf litter obtained in 1998 was higher than in 1997 (Table 2). There were no significant differences in amount of litter between no pruning, pruning at 90 cm and 60 cm in 1998 (Table 2).<br />The litter obtained from pruned pigeon pea in 1997 increased linearly with increasing height of pruning (y = –0.3033 + 0.021×; r = 0.99) while in 1998 there was a quadratic response (y = –1.15 + 0.0767× – 0.0005×2) with the most litter observed with pruning at 90 cm from the ground.<br />Pigeon pea seed yield<br />The pigeon pea seed harvested from pruned treatments in 1996 was less than that in 1997. Seed yield of the plants that were unpruned was significantly higher than pruned in both years. The yield of pruned pigeon pea increased linearly with increasing pruning height (y = –0.08 + 0.0022×; r = 0.93) with no seed being obtained by pruning at 30 cm from the ground in 1996 (Table 3). The seed yield obtained in 1997 for the pruned treatment also increased linearly with increasing pruning height (y = –0.2133 + 0.093×; r = 0.99).<br />Maize grain yield<br />Maize grain yield from the pigeon pea short fallow plots was between 64–121% and 35–127% higher than that from the natural fallow in 1998 and 1999, respectively. No pruning and pruning at 30 cm above ground resulted in significantly higher maize grain yield than the natural fallow in 1998 (Table 4). In 1999, the maize grain yield from<br /><br />Table 1.

It was observed that the changes in these soil parameters were not peculiar to the improved fallow or natural fallow treatment. The<br /><br />changes in soil N, P, and K may be due to the litter addition, nutrient capture from the sub-soil into the top soil and biological nitrogen fixation (Rao et al., 1998). The changes were however greater for the pigeon pea fallow pruned at 60 cm. The decline in soil pH was probably due to leaching of basic cations, hydrogen ions released during biological nitrogen fixation and plant uptake of cations and their storage in standing biomass (Adejuwan and Adesina, 1990).<br />Studies done by Whiteman and Norton (1981) and Karachi and Zengo (1998) have demonstrated the potential of using pigeon pea fodder to supplement livestock feeding as it increases the intake of low quality herbage subsequently resulting in increase animal live-weight. From Figure 1 and Table 3 it is evident that it is possible to obtain a high quantity of fodder by pruning pigeon pea at 60 cm at the same time as providing some seed for human consumption. A farmer can obtain an average of 6.1 t DM ha–1 of pigeon pea fodder annually – estimated from Figure 1 – by pruning at 60 cm over the two-year period. Then from a hectare of land of pigeon pea short fallow it is possible to supplement the feeding of 56 sheep over a period of one year at the rate of 300 g head–1 day–1. This average fodder yield is comparable to that of 3.5 to 6.0 t ha–1 from pruning at 25 and 50 cm heights obtain by Daniel and Ong (1990).<br />The seed yield of pigeon pea in 1996 was low as compared to the expected yield of 0.7 t ha–1 (Daniel and Ong, 1990), possibly due to the late planting and short period between time of planting and harvest for the first year. In the second year, however, the yield for no pruning was comparable to the expected yield (Table 3). The low yield of pruned pigeon pea treatments may be due to the effect of pruning as the plants were unable to regain their potential for seed yield. In general pruning had a significant effect on pigeon pea seed yield, especially in the first year of pruning (Table 3). In the second year the crop experienced the full cropping season thus resulting in a better yield. The seed yield decreases with decreasing height of pruning, as the shorter the pruning height from the ground the more difficult it is for the plant to ratoon or re-grow (Akinola et al., 1975).<br />The litter obtained from 1998 recording was higher than that of 1997, which may be the effect<br /><br />201<br />of pruning and the short lapse between planting and recording first (1997) litter. The amount of litter obtained is dependent on pigeon pea genotype, management practice and time of planting as the vegetative phase of long duration pigeon pea is photosensitive (Roy Sharma et al., 1981). Pruning reduces litter and this reduction increases with pruning at a shorter height from the ground. This is because pruning at such low heights drastically reduces the presence of aged leaves.<br />The improved maize grain yield of 3.02 t ha–1 obtained from the improved fallow treatments after two years of pigeon pea short fallow as compared to the 1.54 t ha–1 obtained under natural fallow in 1998 is an indication of the potential to use pigeon pea as a short fallow. The 96% increase in maize grain yield of improved fallow over natural fallow in 1998 is higher than the 55% and 57% after a three-year-old and one-year-old pigeon pea fallow obtained by Prinz (1986) and Kumar et al. (1983), respectively. However, the increase was less than the 150–270% obtained from maize grain yield after a two-year fallow of Sesbania sesban over natural fallow (Torquebiau and Kwesiga, 1996). The increase in maize yield could be the result of litter addition, biological nitrogen fixation from roots and nodules and enhanced mineralization (Rao et al., 1998). Pigeon pea fallow residual effect was observed in the second year after clearing of fallow, with the improved fallow giving 82% higher maize grain yield than the control. The continued residual effect could compensate for the loss of production during the fallow period. The maize grain yields obtained in 1999 were generally low. This was possibly due to the high annual rainfall of 1933 mm with 133 rainy days from February to October in 1999 as compared to 836 mm with 59 rainy days in 1998 and 30 year long term average of 1044 mm in Nyankpala (SARI, 1999; SARI, 2000). The prunings obtained by pruning the pigeon pea to about 60 cm provide sufficient fodder that may be used to supplement livestock feeding without sacrificing much in terms of its effect on the soil fertility status, pigeon pea seed yield and yield of the subsequent maize crop, making this the best option for such a short duration fallow system.<br /><br />202<br />Acknowledgements<br />The authors are thankful to the Savanna Agricultural Research Institute and the Government of Ghana for financial support on this study.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: Adejuwan, J.O., Adesina, F.A., Organic matter and nutrient status under cultivated fallows: An example of Gliricidia sepium fallows from South Western Nigeria (1990) Agroforestry Systems, 10, pp. 23-32; <br/>Adu, S.V., (1957) Report on Detail Soil Survey of Central Agricultural Station (Presently: Savanna Agricultural Research Institute), pp. 11-12. , Nyankpala, Ghana;<br/>Akinola, J.O., Whiteman, P.C., Walis, E.S., (1975) The Agronomy of Pigeon Pea (Cajanus Cajan), p. 57. , Review Series No. 1/1975.

Introduction<br />Leaf area development involves the production of new leaves, increase in the size of existing leaves and the senescence of old leaves. It is a fundamental process of crop production as leaves intercept solar radiation and produce carbohydrates through photosynthesis. The production, expansion and survival of green leaf area are important determinants of crop productivity, as are the relative durations of the vegetative and reproductive phases. There is a wide diversity in time to ¯owering and maturity of pigeonpea<br />* Corresponding author. E-mail address: michael.robertson@tag.csiro.au (M.J.

Millspaugh) and cultivars differ in growth habit and plant canopy characteristics. Growth habit mainly depends on the number of primary and secondary branches and the angle of branches on the stem on which they are borne resulting in a continuous variety of forms from upright to spreading (Remanandan, 1990). Genotypic differences have been reported for leaf size which are in turn in¯uenced by the growing environment (ICRISAT, 1975, 1976). Pigeonpea is sown at a wide range of plant densities depending on the growth duration of the cultivar, the cropping season and system. The classi®cation of maturity duration used here is based on time to ¯ower when the crop is sown soon after the summer solstice at ICRISAT (17848HN).

These same cultivars are grown at 33 plants mÀ2 in sowings approaching the winter solstice. Shorter-duration cultivars are cropped at 33 plants mÀ2 in all seasons (Chauhan, 1990).<br />Currently most of the world's pigeonpea cultivation is in the tropics where it is sown at the commencement of the rainy season, but interest in pigeonpea is expanding into new cropping environments and systems (Singh et al., 1990, 1996). Models that simulate the growth and development of a crop are a useful tool to examine environmental constraints to production. The ability to predict leaf area development is central to the objective of simulating the growth and development of pigeonpea. There are no reports in the literature of attempts to analyse canopy development in pigeonpea for the purpose of modelling. This paper examines the physiology of leaf area development in pigeonpea with a view to develop relationships that predict green leaf area. To this end the paper reanalyses published data and reports new experimental data collected at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), India (17848HN). Although genotypic differences have been reported for growth habit and leaf size, the parameters that describe leaf area dynamics here are based on<br /><br />physiological processes that are expected to apply over a wide range of cultivars. Few studies on pigeonpea have compared leaf area development across seasons, maturity groups and plant densities. The modi®cation of leaf area by these factors is examined here. Water limitations and nutrition, which also affect leaf area dynamics, are not considered in this study.<br />2. Materials and methods<br />2.1. Data<br />Functions describing rates of node and leaf production, and senescence were developed by re-analysing data collected in experiments described in detail in Narayanan et al. (1981), Sheldrake and Narayanan (1979), ICRISAT (1980) and Sanetra (1996) (Table 1). In addition, three trials were conducted in the rainy seasons of 1990±1991 and 1994±1995 to develop and test the required functions (Table 1). Relevant experimental details of these studies are given below.<br />In study 1, node appearance of three pigeonpea cultivars was recorded during the rainy season of 1990, in monthly sowings from June to December<br /><br />Table 1<br />Summary of data sets used for establishing relationships for leaf area development.

Pots of 30 cm diameter were laid out in a three-replicate split-plot design with sowing dates as main plots. Cultivars were assigned to sub-plots. Only data for the short-duration cultivar ICPL 87 are presented here. The pots were placed in the open and irrigated to ®eld capacity at regular intervals. Appearance of nodes on the main stem were measured at regular intervals for all sowings.<br />In study 2, data on leaf area development of diverse cultivars was measured at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India. In the rainy season of 1990 on 3 July, nine pigeonpea cultivars from three maturity groups were sown in a split-plot experiment with three replicates. Extra-short (100±110 days to maturity) and shortduration (120±140 days) cultivars were sown at a density of 33 plants mÀ2 while medium-duration cultivars were sown at 6.7 plants mÀ2. Main plots were water supply regimes by irrigation or rainfall. Irrigated plots were watered at regular intervals to prevent water stress. Only irrigated data are used here. Cultivars with similar growth duration formed sub-plots and measured 9 m Â 6 m. As part of the growth analysis, nodes on the main stem were counted at 7±10 day intervals in the early and post-¯owering growth stages, and at 14day intervals in the vegetative stage.<br />In study 3, conducted in the rainy season of 1994, growth by an extra-short, short- and medium-duration pigeonpea was measured under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot with four replications. Data on the rate of leaf senescence for the extra-short, short- and medium-duration cultivars was used to develop the relationships between thermal time and rate of leaf senescence after ¯owering.<br />In all three studies a basal application of di-ammonium phosphate at the recommended rate of 100 kg haÀ1 was applied. Plots were weeded manually at regular intervals in the early growth stages until canopy closure. Insecticides were used at frequent intervals, starting from the time of ¯owering, to control insect pest damage, especially that caused by Helicoverpa armigera. In all data sets listed in Table 1 a node was de®ned at that which subtended a fully expanded leaf. Once senescence of leaves began, the total number of nodes on the main stem of the plant was counted by adding the number of visible leaf scars to the number of fully expanded green leaves still attached to the main stem.<br /><br />2.2. Data analysis<br /><br />Plant leaf area was analysed in terms of the func-<br /><br />tional relationships between thermal time and main-<br /><br />stem node appearance, between main-stem nodes and<br /><br />leaves per plant, the distribution of individual leaf area<br /><br />by node, and between leaf senescence and thermal<br /><br />time.

Results and discussion<br />3.1. Leaf appearance<br />3.1.1. Main-stem nodes No published data are available on the cardinal<br />temperatures for leaf production in pigeonpea. Turnbull (1986) grew pigeonpea in temperature-controlled glasshouses at 12- and 16-h photoperiods and recorded the appearance of main-stem nodes until ¯oral initiation. The data from this experiment were re-analysed to determine the cardinal temperatures and phyllochron for node appearance. The experiment was conducted using a combination of day and night temperatures ranging from 16 to 328C as treatments. There was a constant rate of appearance of main-stem nodes in all temperature treatments (data for 16 h daylength presented in Fig. 1). The rate of appearance of main-stem nodes is a linear function of the daily mean temperature in the range from 20 to 328C. McPherson et al. (1985) also found that the rate of node appearance increased in the range of 16±328C, suggesting that the optimum temperature is close to 328C. A base temperature of 11.98C and phyllochron of 208Cd was estimated from the linear regression of Turnbull's data, with R2  0X89. The slopes of responses for plants exposed to 12 and 16 h photoperiods were not signi®cantly P ` 0X05 different. A ®tted base temperature of 11.98C is higher than a modal value derived from numerous germination<br /><br />166 R. Ranganathan et al. / Field Crops Research 69 (2001) 163±172<br /><br />Fig. 1. Rate of node appearance on the main stem (measured in a 16-h day) as a function of mean temperature. Data from Turnbull (1986).<br /><br />and emergence studies, which suggest a value for the base temperature closer to 108C (Carberry et al., 2001). When the regression is ®tted with the base temperature set to 108C the R2 value decreased slightly to 0.88 and the phyllochron increased to 248Cd per node.<br />The consistency of these derived parameters across seasons, soil types and plant densities (4 and 33 plants mÀ2) was veri®ed by re-analysing data from experiments of Sheldrake and Narayanan (1979), Sanetra (1996) and study 1. The number of nodes on the main stem was plotted against accumulated thermal time, calculated with a base temperature of 108C and optimum of 328C. There was strong linear relationship between the observed number of nodes on the main stem measured until ¯owering and the accumulated thermal time, the R2 exceeded 0.89 (Fig. 2a and b). The ®tted phyllochron for main-stem nodes, calculated as the inverse of the ®tted regression slope, varied between 32 and 458CdÀ1. While these values are greater than those of Turnbull (1986) there was no signi®cant P ` 0X05 difference between the three studies. These values derived for pigeonpea are similar to those for other warm-season legumes. For example, Craufurd et al. (1997) quote a mean value for cowpea of 428Cd per leaf above a base temperature that varied from 7 to 128C, derived from numerous ®eld sowings. Leong and Ong (1983) derived a phyllochron of 568Cd for peanut in controlled environment studies.<br />No published data or information are available on the effect of crop duration on the rate of node appear-<br /><br />Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 presents node appearance as a function of accumulated thermal time from sowing for indeterminate medium-duration, determinate and indeterminate short-duration, and determinate and indeterminate extra-short duration pigeonpea (Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979; Sanetra, 1996, study 2 data).

Main-stem node appearance as a function of thermal time for indeterminate (NDT) and determinate (DT), short-duration (SD) and extra-short duration (ESD) cultivars, and a medium-duration (MD) cultivar at a low and high plant population density (data from Sanetra, 1996 and study 2). A linear regression is ®tted to the initial portion of the plot where main-stem nodes is a linear function of accumulated thermal time.<br /><br />to produce leaves until maturity. A linear relationship is a good approximation of the rate at which nodes appear on the main stem until ¯owering. The slope of the linear function in Fig. 3 establishes a phyllochron of 31.58Cd for all cultivars, irrespective of growth duration and level of determinacy. After ¯owering, the rate at which nodes are produced tends to slow for indeterminate cultivars, whereas nodes do not develop on the main stem of determinate types after ¯owering. Also shown in Fig. 3 is node appearance for two contrasting plant population densities (4 and 33 plants mÀ2) for a single medium-duration cultivar. Node appearance rates are similar for the two densities, suggesting that in this range, plant density does not affect rate of node appearance on the main stem.<br />3.1.2. Leaves In pigeonpea, more than one leaf can be associated<br />with each main-stem node, i.e. branching can occur. Primary branches begin to appear progressively at the basal main-stem nodes after the appearance of 8±10 leaves on the main stem (Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979). Nodes develop on primary branches and subsequently, secondary and tertiary branches, resulting in leaf number increasing exponentially. The appearance of branches has been successfully analysed in terms of thermal time, suggesting that there may be some conservative relationships between the number of main-stem nodes and total number of leaves on a<br /><br />plant. For example, Leong and Ong (1983) showed for peanut that branches appeared every 1008Cd. It is important when attempting to characterise the potential rate of leaf appearance to consider only low plant densities where inter-plant competition is minimal and hence branching potential can be expressed to its maximum. In Fig. 4, leaf appearance on the plant is plotted as a function of the number of main-stem nodes for a number of medium-duration cultivars all sown at a plant population density of 4 plants mÀ2. Leaves on primary branches appear only after the development of 17±20 nodes on the main stem (Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979; study 4). Thereafter, the number of leaves per plant appear at a rate faster than the number of main-stem nodes, as indicated by the ®tted slope of 10.2 leaves per node for the second phase of the relationship.<br />The data in Fig. 4 suggest that there is little difference among a number of medium-duration cultivars for leaf number production. Data in Fig. 5 show leaf appearance plotted versus thermal time for a range of maturity types at contrasting densities. At the low density of 4.4 plants mÀ2, leaves appear at 0.4 leaves 8CdÀ1, while at high density, where inter-plant competition for assimilates for leaf growth is greater, the rate is 0.07 leaves per 8Cd. Signi®cantly, at both densities there is no consistent effect of cultivar maturity on leaf production. For example, cultivars T 21 and Pusa Ageti mature in 140 and 168 days,<br /><br />168 R. Ranganathan et al. / Field Crops Research 69 (2001) 163±172<br /><br />Fig. 4. Leaf appearance as a function of main-stem nodes for medium-duration pigeonpea (Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979; ICRISAT, 1980).<br /><br />respectively, while ST 1 and ICP 1 reach physiological maturity in 182 days (Fig. 5a). In Fig. 5b crops were sown at 33 plants mÀ2 but in different seasons. ICPL 84023 (104 days) and ICPL 87 (125 days) were grown in June at the start of the rainy season (study 4), and C 11 and ICP 7065 were sown in October in the postrainy season and matured in 110 days (ICRISAT, 1980). In summary, the data examined suggest that the rate of appearance of leaves on a plant, measured until ¯owering, is a function of plant density and is not dependent on cultivar or maturity type. Closely spaced plants have fewer leaves because primary branches do<br /><br />not attain their full size. Fewer secondary and tertiary branches are produced per plant when a crop is grown at high plant densities (Chauhan, unpublished data).<br />3.2. Leaf expansion<br />A number of authors has shown that the size of newly fully expanded leaves varies in a predictable manner with nodal position. The maximum size of newly expanded leaves increases with ontogenetic position for several weeks following emergence, thereafter the size of new leaves either changes little<br /><br />Fig. 5.

Littleton et al. showed that the ontogenetic change in leaf size was caused by corresponding changes in the thermal rate of leaf expansion (cm2 8CdÀ1).<br />In a controlled environment study Flower (1986) demonstrated that pigeonpea leaves attain a size in relation to their position on the main-stem. Leaf size in pigeonpea increases exponentially from the size of the ®rst trifoliate leaf with increase in main-stem node number until a maximum leaf size is reached after which leaf area declines. Leaf size increases in a similar fashion on secondary and tertiary branches. Rawson and Constable (1981) observed that pigeonpea leaves grew from 5 to 95% of their ®nal leaf area in 18±22 days and that average rates of expansion were from 4 to 6 cm2 per day.<br />Data sets containing measurements of the size of individual leaves on a pigeonpea plant are rare. However, the effect of changes in leaf size with ontogeny needs to be accounted for and a relationship between leaf size and main-stem node number has been estimated by an alternative approach. An average leaf size has been calculated by dividing green leaf area of the plant by the number of leaves present. In Fig. 6, from the original data of Sheldrake and Narayanan (1979) and ICRISAT (1980) average leaf size is plotted against main-stem nodes for ®ve medium-duration<br /><br />and one perennial pigeonpea cultivars (Ranganthan, unpublished data). The scatter suggests that there is little genotypic difference for leaf size in mediumduration cultivars. ICP 8094 was initially sown at 12 plants mÀ2 and thinned at regular intervals to 1.5 plants mÀ2 to simulate a crop grown with no inter-plant competition, in an attempt to maximise individual leaf size. Average leaf size in this crop was slightly greater than that of the others and forms an outer envelope to the average leaf size of the other cultivars. In agreement with Flower (1986), average leaf size increases to a maximum and declines rapidly after ¯owering. The decline in average leaf size is explained by the abscission of older leaves that have reached their maximum size. Since few leaves (relative to the number at ¯owering) are produced after ¯owering, leaves that remain on the plant (and whose leaf area is measured) are small and never achieve their potential size because carbon is partitioned to grain at that time.<br />3.3. Leaf senescence<br />Leaf senescence is an integral aspect of plant development. Prior to ¯owering, leaf senescence in irrigated crops is associated with the death of old leaves at the base of the canopy due to age and shading. Sanetra et al. (1998) divided the main stem<br /><br />Fig. 6. Change in mean leaf size with number of main-stem nodes in medium-duration and perennial pigeonpea (data from Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979; ICRISAT, 1980, study 3). The line is ®tted by eye to data for IC 8094 and represents a crop grown with no inter-plant competition (see text for details).<br /><br />170 R. Ranganathan et al. / Field Crops Research 69 (2001) 163±172<br /><br />of plants into four fractions and measured the percentage of attached lea¯ets days after full expansion of the youngest leaf in each fraction. Lea¯et abscission was most rapid in the bottom layer and about 45 days after full expansion, the percentage of attached lea¯ets dropped to less than 5%. In contrast, close to 40% lea¯ets remained attached in the next layer. At ¯owering less than 10% of all lea¯ets in the bottom layer were still attached. The low photosynthetic rate does not provide the energy costs associated with maintenance respiration. Leaves that were 30±50 days old had rapidly declining rates of photosynthesis but not of transpiration (Rawson and Constable, 1981). After ¯owering, leaf senescence is associated with the<br /><br />translocation of nitrogen from the leaves to the grain (Sinclair and de Wit, 1975; Sanetra et al., 1998). In all data sets examined, LAI reached a maximum soon after ¯owering and decreased sharply thereafter. Even in indeterminate cultivars the same pattern was observed as loss in leaves due to senescence overtakes gain.<br />An attempt was made to relate the rate of leaf area senescence after ¯owering to thermal time. While the systematic effects of temperature on senescence are still uncertain, generally, leaves remain greener at lower temperature, and sometimes the period of ``greeness'' can be related to a developmental duration (e.g. Littleton et al., 1979 for cowpea).<br /><br />Fig. 7.

Ranganathan et al. / Field Crops Research 69 (2001) 163±172<br /><br />171<br /><br />The number of main-stem nodes bearing green leaves decreased in a linear fashion with thermal time elapsed since ¯owering (Fig. 7a) (Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979; study 4). The constant rate of main-stem leaf senescence was similar for pigeonpea of different duration groups (ICPL 84023, extra short; Pusa Ageti, short; ST 1, ICP 1 and HY 3C, medium) and when grown at densities ranging from 4 to 33 plants mÀ2 (Pusa Ageti, ST 1, ICP 1 and HY 3C, 4.44 plants mÀ2; ICPL 84023, 33 plants mÀ2). After ¯owering, a thermal time of 35.78Cd was required for each main-stem leaf to senesce. As each main-stem node senesces, 0.03 of the total number of leaves on the plant also senescence (Fig. 7b).<br />4. Conclusions<br />The functions described above form the basis of a model of potential canopy leaf area expansion and senescence, incorporating effects of temperature and cultivar maturity. Node appearance until ¯owering can be predicted from thermal time, with the degree of node appearance after ¯owering being a function of the degree of determinacy and carbon availability for leaf growth. The potential rate of leaf production per node is similar for a wide range of cultivar maturities and cultivars within each maturity class. Density has a signi®cant effect on leaf appearance per main-stem node, presumably mediated through inter-plant competition for assimilate for leaf growth. Models of canopy expansion dealing should be able to accommodate such competition effects at high densities. A comparison of canopy development in different duration groups shows that rates of node production, leaf production and senescence are similar for cultivars across duration groups, and ¯owering is the key developmental event that moderates these rates. The group of functional relationships presented here can, with biomass accumulation and partitioning in pigeonpea, form the basis for a simulation model.<br />Acknowledgements<br />The authors would like to acknowledge the help provided by Anil Kumar, Gayatri Devi, J.

An experiment was carried out in a slash-and-burn production system in northern Laos to evaluate legume establishment methods and effects of legume species on fallow vegetation, weeds, yield of upland rice, and soil parameters. Cajanus cajan, Calliandra calothyrsus, Crotalaria anagyroides, Flemingia congesta, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania sesban were dibbled separately or mixed with rice. Legume and planting method had no effect on rice yield. Legume establishment was slightly improved and vigor after rice harvest was higher when planted in separate hills. Compared to control (no legume), the above ground fallow biomass observed 13 months after establishment, consisting mostly of Chromolaena odorata, was reduced by 68% with C. anagyroides and by 40% with L. leucocephala, while other species had no effect. Most of the C. cajan and S. sesban plants died. In March 1995, 22 months after planting, the biomass was 0.21, 0.25, 1.62 and 2.56 kg m–2 for F. congesta, C. calothyrsus, C. anagyroides, and L. leucocephala, respectively. Legume species had no effect on rice yield or weed biomass in the rice crop. The species tested can influence fallow vegetation but do not allow for field preparation without burning. Compared to mulching, burning of residue reduced weed biomass by 42%, soil organic C by 9% and the C/N ratio by 6% but increased extractable P by 90% and pH by 8%.<br />Introduction<br />In the hilly regions of northern Laos, upland rice is the major crop in slashand-burn systems, produced annually on about 200,000 ha (National Statistical Center, 1993). Slash-and-burn farmers consider weeds, insufficient rainfall, and rodent damage as the foremost constraints to upland rice production (Roder et al., 1997a). Shorter fallow periods resulted in high labor requirements for weeding, and farmers are under pressure to change to other landuse-systems.<br />Improved fallow systems have been recommended as a strategy to offset the effects of short fallow periods with the assumption that farmers would more readily adopt sequential improvements to existing systems rather than wholly new systems (Fujisaka, 1991). Improved fallow systems are expected to provide faster, yet similar ecological benefits as natural fallow (Robison and McKean, 1992). Properties expected of species for fallow improvement include: ease of establishment, provision of plant cover after crop harvest,<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />292<br />large biomass production, fast decomposition rate, weed suppression, and ability to mobilize plant nutrients from lower soil layers (Fujisaka, 1991; Rao et al., 1990; Robison and McKean, 1992). Under the Lao conditions improved fallow systems are also expected to increase fodder availability, accelerate nutrient cycling, suppress weeds, allow seed bed preparation without burning, and improve soil/water conservation (Roder et al., 1995).<br />Considering the limited market opportunity for annual crops and horticulture products, the comparatively low population density, and the hilly topography, timber and livestock production are generally thought to be the best alternatives for the Lao upland farmer. Livestock production is the major source of cash income for farmers in much of Laos, relying on fallow land, waste land, and forest as the major grazing resources (Roder and Maniphone, 1995). There is potential for increased livestock production by replacing the fallow vegetation with fodder crops.<br />Introduction trials with potential species for fallow improvement, green manure, and/or fodder production were conducted in Luang Prabang during 1991–1995. The most promising shrubby species following these experiments included: Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria anagyroides, Flemingia congesta, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and Gliricidia sepium (LAO-IRRI, Annual technical reports 1993, 1994 and 1995, unpublished). Farmers acceptance of introduced species will partly depend on the availability of cheap and practical establishment methods and the ease of residue management. Earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility of broadcast seeding into a standing rice crop for a wide number of species and the possibility of establishing shrubby legumes by dibbling legume seed mixed with rice seed (Roder and Maniphone, 1995).<br />There is need to further test planting methods and to evaluate the effect of the planted species on fallow vegetation, their residue management, and the effect of species and residue management on soil properties and successive rice crops. An experiment was conducted during 1993–95 to: 1) assess the possibility of establishing selected fast growing legume species simultaneously with a rice crop; 2) quantify the effect of legume species and establishment method on legume survival, legume biomass production, and weed suppression; and 3) quantify the effect of legume species and residue management on weed and pest populations, rice yield, and selected soil parameters.<br />Materials and methods<br />The experiment was conducted at the Houay Khot Research Station (19° N), under typical upland conditions. Soil at the station is classified as Eutric Cambisol (Soil Survey and Soil Classification Laboratory Dongdok, Department of Agriculture and Extension, Vientiane, unpublished). The station is located in the drier zone of northern Laos with an average annual rainfall<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />293<br />of about 1300 mm. Annual rainfall for 1993, 1994 and 1995 recorded at the station was close to the long-term average for the region, but was unusually low for the last 3 months of 1993 (Table 1). As far as possible, areas with termite mounds and tree stumps were excluded from the experiment. Nevertheless, soil conditions were highly heterogeneous, as is common in slash-and-burn fields (Andriesse and Schelhaas, 1987). The medium duration, traditional, glutinous rice variety ‘Vieng’ was used for the experiment. Spacing of rice was 0.2 × 0.25 m in 1993 and 0.25 × 0.30 m in 1995.<br />Planting and observations in 1993<br />The legume treatments 1) Control (rice only); 2) Calliandra calothyrsus; 3) Leucaena leucocephala; 4) Flemingia congesta; 5) Crotalaria anagyroides; 6) Sesbania sesban and 7) Pigeon pea (ICP 8094) were planted on 26 May at a distance of 1.5 × 0.2 m either mixed with rice (rice and legume in the same hill) or in a separate row replacing every sixth row of rice. Planting legume in separate row resulted in 17% lower rice density. The experimental design was a split-plot (legume as main plot and planting method as split plot treatment) with three replicates and a sub-plot size of 25 m2. All seeds, except pigeon pea and C. anagyroides were dipped in boiling water for 30 s immediately before planting to break dormancy. Rice and legume seeds were treated with Carbaryl (85%) immediately before planting. Approximately 10 seeds of rice and/or five seeds of the respective legume species were placed in 3–5 cm deep holes made with a dibble stick following the traditional planting method. Weed was controlled by hand weeding. Pigeon pea and C. anagyroides plants growing taller than the rice plants were cut below the rice canopy in August and September. Rice yields adjusted to 14% moisture, were measured from whole plots after removing the border rows on 8 October.<br /><br />Table 1.

Legume height was measured at rice harvest from 10 randomly selected hills.<br />Vigor of legumes and weed suppression in 1994<br />A double sampling method (Cook and Stubbendieck, 1986) was used to estimate weed biomass in June. Fresh biomass for Chromolaena odorata and other weeds was estimated from five frames of 0.5 m2 placed randomly in the plot between the legume rows. One frame was clipped from each plot to calibrate the visual estimate.<br />Legume height was measured from 10 plants per plot. The canopy cover was calculated based on the distance between canopy cover of legume rows at 10 positions [% cover = (distance measured – row distance)/row distance]. The numbers of legume hills present was counted from the whole plot to estimate legume persistence.<br />Observations in 1995 (rice yield, soil and pest parameters)<br />During 1994 most of the S. sesban and pigeon plants died. Since the vegetation cover for these two treatments was not different from the control treatment, no further measurements were taken from these plots. The plant cover for the remaining treatments was slashed in March 1995. Legume biomass was measured separately for woody parts (diameter &gt; 0.2 cm) and leaves and small branches, C. odorata, and other weed species from an area of 8 m2 per plot. Sub-samples for each fraction were air dried from the first replicate to estimate moisture content. After slashing the whole plots were split into two randomly allotted treatments of 1) burning residue and 2) mulching residue. Each residue management plot included both legume establishment treatments and all observations in 1995, except biomass at the time of slashing, were made for the residue management plots (combining the earlier establishment sub-plots). Residue were burned on 22 April. After removing weed by hoeing on all plots, rice was planted on 15 May.<br />The following observations were made during the season:<br />• Fresh weed and legume biomass was measured at the time of weeding on 16 June (from 4 frames of 0.5 m2) and 25. July (from whole plot).<br />• White grub damage was estimated by counting damaged hills on a whole plot basis.<br />• Soil samples were collected 40 days (before N application) after planting, taking four sub-samples per plot for the depths of 0–7.5 and 7.5–15 cm. Air dried soil samples were analyzed by the Analytical Service Laboratories at IRRI Los Baños, for pH (in H2O), organic C (Walkley and Black method), extractable P (Double acid extraction), total N and available ammonium-N.<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />295<br />• Chlorophyll content of the upper most, fully expended leaf was measured on 15 August with the Minolta SPAD-502 Chlorophyll meter taking three readings per leaf from 10 leaves per plot.<br />• Close to rice maturity, five rice hills per plot were uprooted and root and soil samples collected to quantify root knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) density on the crop root and in the soil, following methods described by Prot and Matias (1995).<br />• At maturity rice grain yields were measured from whole plot after removing 2 border rows.<br /><br />Results and discussion<br />Legume establishment and initial performance (1993)<br />The rice yield was moderate with 1.4 t ha–1 and not affected by the legume species or planting method (Table 2).

No effect of planting method on the height of<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />297<br />pigeon pea and C. anagyroides was apparent because these species were cut back to uniform levels (below rice canopy) in August and September. In an earlier study (Roder and Maniphone, 1995) establishment success of leucaena and pigeon pea was similar, but pigeon reduced rice yield by 55–65%.<br />Effect on weed biomass and legume performance during fallow period (1994)<br />Over the period October 1993 to June 1994 most of the S. sesban plants disappeared and pigeon pea lost about 23% of its stand (Table 2), while plant density was little changed for the other species. The remaining pigeon pea plants were very weak and largely overgrown by weeds. Crotalaria anagyroides and L. leucocephala were outstanding in growth and vigor manifested in superior plant height (Table 2) and better canopy cover (Table 3). Chromolaena odorata was the dominant weed species contributing 44–77% of the total weed biomass. Compared to the control, the total weed biomass was reduced by 68% with C. anagyroides and by 40% with L. leucocephala.<br />Establishment method had no effect on legume survival or weed biomass in 1994, but slightly affected legume vigor. Compared to planting mixed with rice, legumes seeded separately were taller and had a better canopy cover (Tables 3 and 4).<br /><br />Table 3.

The contribution by the other legumes towards the total above ground biomass present at the time of slashing was 88, 86, 45 and 44% for C. anagyroides, L. leucocephala, C. calothyrsus and F. congesta, respectively (Table 4). The highest total biomass was produced by L. leucocephala with over 80% of the biomass consisting of woody branches &gt; 0.2 cm diameter. Calliandra calothyrsus and F. congesta had no influence on the total biomass. Crotalaria anagyroides produced the highest biomass of non-woody parts. When excluding woody parts, the total biomass was 0.49, 0.45, 0.89, 0.36 and 0.98 kg m–2 for control, C. calothyrsus, L. leucocephala, F. congesta and C. anagyroides, respectively. Unless woody parts have some value for the farmers (fire wood, market) they provide little benefits to the system except that they may increase the burning temperature. Root biomass, nutrients recycled through leaf fall, and decomposition rates of root, litter, and fresh biomass will largely influence the effects of a particular species on soil fertility and succeeding crops.<br />The performance of pigeon pea is rather disappointing as it is widely recommended as a multipurpose species for fallow improvement, agroforestry, and rotation systems (Boehringer and Caldwell, 1990; Daniel and Ong, 1990; Gooding, 1962). Gooding (1962), reviewing the rotation and green manure value of pigeon pea, concluded that pigeon pea fallows are better than bush<br /><br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />299<br />fallows of equal duration. Following various additional studies with pigeon pea (Roder et al., 1997b) it was, however, concluded that under the conditions in northern Laos, pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement if fallow duration is more than one year.<br />Weed biomass during the rice crop (1995)<br />Legume species had no effect on weed biomass except for a reduction in Mimosa invisa caused by C. anagyroides (Table 5). Compared to mulching, burning reduced C. odorata, M. invisa, other broadleaf species, and grassy species by 66, 35, 48, and 47%, respectively. At the same time burning increased the biomass of woody perennials by 63%. These effects of burning are consistent with observations made in other studies (Roder et al., 1998).<br />Most of the L. leucocephala plants and about 7% of C. calothyrsus and 52% of F. congesta plants present at the time of slashing survived and started coppicing from the left over root stock with no effect by the burning treatment (Tables 2 and 5). Biomass from re-growth of legume root stocks or seedlings contributed 76, 28, 8, and 3% of the total biomass measured for L. leucocephala, C. anagyroides, F. congesta, and C. calothyrsus, respectively.<br />Effect of legume and residue management on rice yield and soil parameters<br />The incidence of white grub damage on rice plants and the density of root knot nematodes on rice roots was increased by C. calothyrsus but not affected by residue management treatment (Table 6). At this stage insufficient information is available on the reproductive biology of the white grub species prevailing in Northern Laos to explain this results. The red inflorescence or the foliage of C. calothyrsus could be a major attraction for the adult insect, but the main period of egg laying activity is likely to be after the time of slashing the vegetation.<br />Chlorophyll estimates taken shortly before rice flowering indicated higher nitrogen status with L. leucocephala and C. anagyroides. The same treatments had the highest grain yield, although legume treatment effects on yield were not significant. Yields were substantially reduced with mulching. This may be a combined effect of lower plant densities, increased rat damage, increased weed competition, and N immobilization. Mulching reduced rice yield by 43, 39, 24, 25 and 26% for the treatments control, C. calothyrsus, L. leucocephala, F. congesta, and C. anagyroides, respectively.<br />Legume treatment had no effect on any of the soil parameters measured. As expected burning compared to mulching increased soil pH and extractable P and reduced the soil organic C and the C/N ratio in the 0–7.5 cm soil layer (Table 7). This effect of burning although modest are, consistent with observations made by others (Nye and Greenland, 1964; Sanchez et al., 1983).<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />300<br />This copy belongs to 'agrawal'<br /><br />Table 5.

Advantages of this method include: no extra labor requirements; young seedlings growing in a rice hill will be protected during farmers’ weeding operations; less weed competition compared with establishment in fallow land; and reduced competition effects on the companion rice crop. Legume performance during the fallow period was not affected by establishment method.<br />Compared to the control with common fallow species, the best legume treatment increased the biomass by over 500%. In spite of this remarkable increase in biomass the effect of legume species on the subsequent rice crop, on weed occurrence during the rice cropping phase and on soil parameters was not significant. Repeated fallow-crop cycles will be necessary to evaluate the potential of these legumes for fallow improvement. The effect of legume species on pest such as white grub and root knot nematodes can be more readily quantified and may have stronger immediate impacts on crop yields.<br />When compared to mulching, burning of the biomass, had strong effects on weed biomass in the rice crop, rice yield, and most of the soil parameters measured.

Slash-and-burn farmers in the hills of Laos urgently need techniques that can sustain rice yields and reduce weed pressure under short fallow periods. For this, the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth) as a fallow crop was evaluated in variety, establishment, and cropping systems studies conducted at Houay Khot station (19° N) from 1992 to 1995. Introduced perennial varieties were not superior to local material for the parameters evaluated. Some semiperennial varieties produced grain yields up to 2.2 t ha–1 but were inferior in weed suppression and survival 12 months after planting. All varieties lost much of their weed competitiveness after the first picking of pods. In studies without weeding, &lt; 10% initially established plants were present 15 months after planting. Compared with pigeon pea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala performed better in biomass production, weed suppression, persistence, and self-regeneration after cultivation of rice. In a rotation study, rice yield was 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.2 t ha–1 (LSD 5% = 0.5 t) for continuous rice, rice–pigeon pea intercropping, rice after pigeon pea, rice after cowpea, rice after Stylosanthes hamata, rice after maize, and rice after fallow, respectively. Compared with continuous rice, intercropping or rotation with pigeon pea reduced nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infestation of rice and weed biomass in the rice crop. In spite of the beneficial effects, rotation or intercropping systems with pigeon pea will only be viable if economic benefits from harvested grain or from using plant parts as livestock feed can be obtained. Because of high mortality and weed invasion pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement if fallow duration is more than one year.<br />Introduction<br />Traditional slash-and-burn rice production systems common in the hills of northern Laos are in a transition phase. Reduced fallow and increased cropping periods have substantially increased the labor requirements for weed control, and farmers are under pressure to change to other production systems. Replacement of the fallow vegetation by fast-growing species, preferably nitrogen-fixing legumes, is a widely recommended technique to maintain crop yields and suppress weeds in slash-and-burn systems under reduced fallow periods (Fujisaka, 1991; Garrity, 1993; Raintree and Warner, 1986). Assuming that farmers would more readily adopt sequential improvements to existing systems, Fujisaka (1991) suggested that the initial research programs aimed at facilitating the transition phase should give high priority to improved fallow systems.<br />Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth) is widely recommended as a multi-<br /><br />46<br />purpose species for fallow improvement, agroforestry, and rotation systems (Boehringer and Caldwell, 1990; Daniel and Ong, 1990; Gooding, 1962; Ong and Daniel, 1990). It produces an edible seed, is well adapted to poor soil conditions and dry environments, and is competitive with many weed species. Gooding (1962), reviewing the rotation and green manure value of pigeon pea, concluded that pigeon pea fallows are better than bush fallows of equal duration. Furthermore, Ae et al. (1990) have shown that pigeon pea is more efficient in utilizing the iron-bound P in Alfisols than the other crops tested and Adu-Gyamfi et al. (1990) concluded that cultivation of pigeon pea increases total P availability in cropping systems with low available P.<br />Pigeon pea is traditionally used in Laos and it was an important feed resource for the insect Laccifer lacca in the production of sticklac (Malpuech, 1924). Upland farmers often have a few plants in their ricefield near the temporary shelter or along a path. Small bundles with young pods, which are eaten in soups, can be found in the local markets from December to February. Unlike in some other Asian countries, the use of mature seed is, however, not known in Laos. There is presently no market for pigeon pea seed and farmers have no incentive for growing this crop on a larger scale. Yet extension and development agencies working with hill farmers in Laos widely recommend pigeon pea to be used in hedgerow, alley, and other alternative cropping systems advocated as replacement for the traditional slash-and-burn methods. Adoption of these systems by the upland farmers remains, however, almost negligible.<br />The development of strategies that may help farmers adapt to shorter fallow and longer cropping cycles while reducing labor for weed control was a major component of research activities under the LAO-IRRI program (1991–95). Pigeon pea was included in various experiments with the objective to 1) evaluate the performance of traditional and improved cultivars, 2) compare pigeon pea with other potential fallow improvement species, and 3) quantify the potential and limitations of pigeon pea as a crop for fallow improvement and other cropping systems that may eventually replace the present slash-andburn methods.<br />Materials and methods<br />All fields experiments were conducted at the Houay Khot Research Station (19° N), under typical upland conditions. Soil at the station is classified at Eutric Cambisol (Soil Survey and Soil Classification Laboratory Dongdok, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, LAO PDR, Vientiane, unpublished) with a pH of 6.1, and an organic C content of 1.6%. The station is located in the drier zone of northern Laos with an average rainfall of 1340 mm recorded for 1961–90 in Luang Prabang town. Rainfall recorded at the station was below this average for 1992 and 1993, but follows the normal pattern, with<br /><br />47<br />most of the precipitation occurring from May to September and dry periods from October to April (Table 1).<br />Field preparation generally consisted of slashing the fallow vegetation one to two months before planting. As far as possible, areas with termite mounds and tree stumps were excluded from the experiments. Nevertheless, soil conditions were highly heterogeneous, as is common in slash-and-burn fields (Andriesse and Schelhaas, 1987), resulting in high variation in some of the studies. Four to eight pigeon pea seeds were dibbled at a spacing of 20 or 25 cm in 3–5 cm deep holes made with a dibble stick, following the traditional planting method for rice. Stands were thinned to two to three plants per hill at 15–30 days after emergence. The cultivar ICP 8094 was included as a check variety in all studies except for the 1992/93 nursery with local cultivars. In all experiments where rice was included, the medium-duration, glutinous, local cultivar ‘Vieng’ was used.<br /><br />Table 1.

Plot size was 9 m2 (3 rows, spaced 0.6 m in 1992/93 and 0.75 m in 1993/94). Planting dates were 9 June in 1992 and 29 June in 1993. Observations for seed yield and seed size were taken from the center row of the plot. Height was measured from 10 plants per plot approximately one year after planting.<br />The performance of perennial and semi-perennial cultivars received from ICRISAT and selected local varieties was evaluated in simple variety trials, using randomized complete block designs (Table 2).

Pruning and variety effects on weed competition and pigeon pea persistence (long life) were evaluated by:<br />• measuring weed (fresh weight) from whole plots at the time of weeding on 11 July;<br />• visually estimating weed contribution to canopy cover (in % of total canopy) and weed ground cover (in %) on 17 October;<br />• counting total hills and hills with dead plants on 17 October<br />Comparison with perennial follow species<br />An experiment was initiated in 1992 to compare the performance of potential fallow and multipurpose tree species. Tree species including pigeon pea (Entry N826) received from the Nitrogen Fixing Tree Association, Hawaii, were raised in a nursery and transplanted in June 1992, with a spacing of 1 × 1 m in randomized complete block design with two replicates and a plot size of 36 m2. Number of plants surviving were counted at intervals specified in Table 7. Fallow vegetation was slashed and burned again in 1994 and plots planted to rice.<br />Methods of pigeon pea establishment<br />Two methods of establishment were evaluated, namely 1) broadcasting seed into a rice crop at the time of weeding and 2) dibbling pigeon pea at the same time as rice either mixed with rice or in a separate hill. Methods were described earlier (Roder and Maniphone, 1995).<br /><br />49<br />Rotation effect and residue management<br />A crop rotation experiment comparing 1) continuous rice, 2) continuous rice–pigeon pea intercropped, 3) rice–pigeon pea rotation, 4) rice–cowpea rotation, 5) rice–stylo (Stylosanthes hamata) rotation, 6) rice–maize rotation, and 7) rice–fallow rotation was initiated in 1992 (all treatments, including fallow, refer to periods of one year). A randomized complete block design with 4 replicates and a plot size of 21 m2 was used for the experiment. All treatments had rice in 1992 and again in 1994. Planting densities were 20 × 25 cm for rice, 25 × 50 cm for cowpea, and pigeon pea and 50 × 50 cm for maize. Stylo was broadcast sown at the rate of 30 kg ha–1 at the last weeding of rice in August. In the intercropping treatment pigeon pea was spaced at 100 cm alternating with three rows of rice. In the intercropping treatment pigeon pea plants were pruned back twice in July and August to the level of the rice canopy. Vetiver grass was planted along the plot boundaries. Rice yield was measured from whole plot after removing a border row. Weed biomass (fresh) was measured from whole plots at all weedings in 1994. Soil samples collected at the time of planting in 1994 (eight subsamples per plot from the 0–7.5 cm depth interval) were air-dried and analyzed by the Soil Survey and Soil Classification Laboratory Dongdok, Vientiane for soil pH, total N, and extractable P (Olson). Samples of rice root and soil were collected from five hills per plot in 1994 (all treatments) and 1995 (treatments continuous rice and rice intercropping with pigeon pea) to quantify root knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infestation following methods described by Prot and Matias (1995).<br />Results and discussions<br />Characteristics/performance of local and exotic varieties<br />The local cultivars evaluated were generally vigorous, tall perennials with relatively small seed size and moderate grain yield potential (Table 3). Introduced perennial cultivars did not show any advantage over the local entries for plant height, vigor, days to maturity, or seed yield (Table 4). In an experiment comparing selected, introduced semi-perennial varieties with selected local and introduced perennial varieties, average grain yield was 1.1 t ha–1 for the perennial and 1.7 t ha–1 for the semi-perennial varieties (Table 5). The latter were, however, inferior in weed suppression and survival (Table 6). Some of these semi-perennial varieties, specially C11, could be useful for systems where grains are harvested for feed or human consumption and where pigeon pea will be replaced by other crops after grain harvest.<br /><br />50<br /><br />Table 3.

Thereafter it becomes vigorous and competitive against most weeds up to the time of maturity of the first seed flush. Seed maturity occurs toward the end of the dry season and plants are not only weakened by age but also strongly affected by moisture stress. Several of the major weed species, especially Chromolaena odorata and Mimosa invisa, are superior to pigeon pea in drought tolerance and/or in recovering after drought stress. The competitiveness of pigeon pea after the first dry season declines fast and, without weed control it generally disappears during the second year after planting.<br />Weed biomass in the 1994 variety trial, measured in July, about five months after grain harvest, was 2.3 and 4.2 t ha–1 for the perennial and semi-peren-<br /><br />53<br />nial varieties, respectively (Table 6). In observations made three months later, average weed contribution to canopy biomass, weed ground cover, and survival of pigeon pea plants were 6, 11, and 80% for perennial varieties and 21, 36, and 63% for semiperennial varieties, respectively (Table 6). Although there was a substantial difference between perennial and semi-perennial entries even the former lost much of their vigor after the first year and were unable to successfully compete with the existing weed species. Pruning not only opened the canopy cover but also further reduced the vigor of the plants, resulting in a higher number of dead plants and higher weed competition (Table 6).<br />In a study comparing different fast-growing perennial fallow species, only 9% of the pigeon pea plants were still present 15 months after transplanting (Table 7). Compared with pigeon pea, some of the perennial species, specially leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and Gliricidia sepium, are not only superior in vigor and weed suppression but also in their capacity to survive during the phase of a rice crop. They coppice from roots and/or from the stem base left at the time of field preparation and provide fast canopy cover after rice harvest (Table 7). In another study comparing pigeon pea with leucaena and Crotalaria anagyroides, pigeon pea was completely suppressed by weed one year after planting, while the other two species contributed more than 80% to total aboveground biomass at the time of slashing two years after planting (LAOIRRI, Technical Report 1995, LAO-IRRI project, Vientiane, LAO PDR, unpublished).<br />Following these results, pigeon pea has little merit for fallow improvement, especially for systems with fallow periods longer than one year. Thus the assertions by various authors (Boehringer and Caldwell, 1990; Daniel and<br /><br />Table 7.

By broadcasting seeds immediately after weeding at varying dates, establishment was 4, 5, 8, 20, 22 and 26 plants m–2 and legume cover at harvest was 1, 2, 2, 7, 17, and 14% for pigeon pea, lablab (Lablab purpureus), Crotalaria juncea, Centrosema pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides, and Pueraria phaseoloides, respectively (Roder and Maniphone, 1995, seed rates used were 60, 80 30, 30, 20 and 20 kg ha–1 for pigeon pea, lablab, Crotalaria juncea, Centrosema pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides, and Pueraria phaseoloides, respectively).<br />Good establishment of pigeon pea was achieved by dibbling it in hills separate of the rice as well as in hills mixed with rice. Vigorous growth of pigeon pea, however, suppresses rice yield unless plants are pruned back below the rice canopy. In an establishment study in 1992 without pigeon pea pruning, rice yield was reduced by 55% where pigeon pea was mixed with rice and by 66% where pigeon pea and rice were dibbled separately (Roder and Maniphone, 1995). In a similar study conducted in 1993, establishment of pigeon pea was 72% when mixed with rice and 74% when planted in separate hills. Pigeon pea was pruned back below the rice canopy and rice yield was not affected (LAO-IRRI, Technical Report 1995, LAO-IRRI project, Vientiane, LAO PDR, unpublished).<br />Rotation and intercropping effects<br />In the rotation study, highest rice yields were observed after a year of pigeon pea or fallow (Table 8). Furthermore, rice after pigeon pea had lower weed biomass than rice after rice, fallow, or cowpea. Soil N, pH, and extractable P in the 0–7.5 cm depth were highest for the pigeon pea (only significant at P = 0.1 for extractable P). The apparent higher P availability with pigeon pea supports findings by Adu-Gyamfi et al. (1990), but it is not possible to infer from this study how far it is caused by faster residue turnover, by organic acids released by pigeon pea, or by other factors. This effect of pigeon pea rotation warrants further studies and could be very important under P-limiting conditions.<br />In 1994, nematode infestation was high for the continuous rice and low for rice after fallow (Table 8). In spite of the high variation, pigeon pea as a previous crop or intercrop significantly reduced nematode infestation when compared with continuous rice treatment. Similarly nematode infestation in 1995 was 2794 and 1940 no. g–1 root (not significant) or 5.6 and 0.4 no. g–1 soil (P &gt; F = 0.1), for the treatments continuous rice and rice intercropping<br /><br />Table 8.

Nematode infestation could be the major cause for declining rice yield in continuous rice cropping systems. The results confirm the high rotation value of pigeon pea as reported by others (Gooding 1962; Daniel and Ong, 1990; Willey et al., 1981). Grain yield of pigeon pea was 0.7, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.6 t ha–1 for the intercropping treatments 1992, 1993 and 1994, and the rotation treatment 1993, respectively. Yet establishment of a pigeon pea stand will require extra labor and seed and unless there is an economic return from pigeon pea harvested or there are other long-term advantages from pigeon pea rotation, the traditional fallow rotation will be the better option for the farmer.<br />Residue management becomes a major problem when planting rice after a pigeon pea crop without tillage or burning. Much of the benefits of pigeon pea, especially N and mulching effects, are lost if the residue is removed or burned. In a study conducting in 1993, rice yields were 0.7, 1.2 and 1.5 t ha–1, with removing, burning, or chopping and mulching the pigeon pea residue, respectively (LAO-IRRI, Technical Report 1993, LAO-IRRI project, Vietiane, LAO PDR, unpublished). Farmers are, however, unlikely to accept mulching of pigeon pea residues due to difficulties during planting and weeding operations and increased risk of rat damage.<br />Pigeon pea harvested at maturity or green pods could be used as an ingredient for locally used animal feeds (Grimaud, 1988; Salunkhe et al., 1986). Further investigations addressing the economic aspects and labor requirements for pigeon pea used in rice rotation systems may be relevant. Semi-perennial varieties with good initial vigor and high seed yield would be more suitable for grain or pod production than the traditional varieties presently used by farmers.<br />Summary and conclusions<br />Pigeon pea is well adapted to the soil and climatic conditions in northern Laos. It can produce high quantities of biomass and grain with minimal input. The local varieties have excellent properties for biomass production, weed suppression, and persistence, while semi-perennial varieties have better grain yield potential. Provided that a market can be found for seed or that parts of the plant can be used as a feed, it may have some potential as a rotation crop.<br />It is, however, important to note that<br />• pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement in systems with fallow periods of more than one year;<br />• pigeon pea is inferior for biomass production, weed suppression, and persistence when compared with leucaena, Gliricidia sepium, and Crotalaria anagyroides;<br />• unlike many small-seeded, shade-tolerant species such as stylo, Pueraria sp. and Centrosema sp., pigeon pea cannot be established by broadcast seeding into the rice crop and requires extra labor for establishment;<br /><br />57<br />• unlike leucaena, Gliricidia sepium and stylo, pigeon pea is not capable of self-regenerating from roots or seeds after a rice crop;<br />• because of poor persistence, pigeon pea is not a suitable species for hedgerow or alley cropping systems;<br />• without economic returns in the form of cash for grain or livestock products, pigeon pea does not provide sufficient benefits to the upland rice farmer to pay for the extra labor and seed required to maintain a pigeon pea rotation system.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>; <p>References: Andriesse, J.P., Schelhaas, R.M., A monitoring study of nutrient cycles in soils used for shifting cultivation under various climatic conditions in Tropical Asia.

The identification of alternative practices requires field studies of crop<br />responses to provide appropriate information.<br />Approximately one third of the soils in the SAT are Alfisols (Kampen and Burford,<br />1980). These soils have low productivity, particularly under rainfed situations, but are<br />critical for food production for large numbers of the world population. Mullins et al.<br />(1990) note that the crusting and hardsetting characteristics found in some Alfisols are<br />also evident in other soil types in tropical and Mediterranean regions. Major constraints<br />of Alfisols include low water holding capacity, poor nutrition, low cation exchange<br />capacity, 10~ organic matter content particularly in cultivated soils, and poor soil<br />physical characteristics. Examples of the latter are such as a tendency to surface seal,<br />crust and hardset on drying and low soil strength under saturated soil conditions leading<br />to slumping, increased bulk density and loss of surface roughness (El-Swaify<br />et al.,<br />1985). Hence, agricultural practices which cause further losses in soil fertility, such as<br />tillage, make a difficult soil even harder to manage profitably.<br />A range of potential management systems exist for Alfisols of the SAT (El-Swaify et<br />al., 1985; Venkateswarlu,<br />1987). These options generally relate to soil management<br />between bunds (interbund management) and can be categorised as tillage and biologically based systems.<br />The advantages of tillage options may include increased crop establishment and<br />yields, weed control, improved infiltration and reduced runoff (Laryea et al., 1991;<br />Gupta and Moncreif, 1994) but the longevity of these effects may be short (Vittal et al.,<br />1983). The principles behind tillage are to increase soil porosity, to destroy surface<br />crusts, and to manipulate surface roughness to improve water intake (Hoogmoed, 1995).<br />However, continuous tillage accelerates organic matter loss resulting in the decline of<br />soil chemical, physical and biological fertility and subsequent land degradation (Lal,<br />1989). Tillage depths vary, depending on the purpose and availability of implements,<br />and range from shallow non inverting tillage to deep profile modification.<br />Biologically-based options include mulch-based and pasture-based systems (Rao et<br />al,, 1992). Mulches are used to protect the soil surface from raindrop impact and<br />subsequent crust formation and to reduce the rate of organic matter decline. In addition<br />to these mulching benefits, a pasture phase creates root channels and increases organic<br />matter throughout the profile. A legume pasture may contribute soil nitrogen. Both<br />mulch-based and pasture-based systems have been reported to change the soil biota<br />(Cogle et al., 1995b). Pasture/crop rotations, such as the tropical ley system (McCown<br />et al., 1985) are one example of biologically-based systems. Dalal et al. (1991) Jones et<br />al. (1991) and Cogle et al. (1991, 1995a) have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of pasture/crop rotations in tropical and subtropical environments.<br />The purpose of this study is to assess tillage and biological options for managing<br />Alfisols in a semi-arid tropical area. Smith et al. (1992) reported an experiment, which<br />commenced in 1988, and studied tillage and biologically options for managing Alfisols.<br />Their paper covered the establishment phase of the study project and discussed all<br />biophysical aspects. Few benefits to crop yield were found after 1 year in 1988, but it<br />was suggested that benefits would slowly develop overtime. In the study, perennials<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al. / Soil &amp; Tillage Research 44 (1997) 235-253<br /><br />231<br /><br />were removed after 4 years and thesetreatments cropped to annual cereals to assessthe<br />benefits of the perennial phase. Our paper interprets agronomic data for the study<br />between 1989 and 1993 for annual crops, and evaluates whether, and why, crop yield<br />benefitted from alternative managementpractices.<br /><br />2. Materials and methods<br />2.1. Experimental site<br />The project was establishedin July 1988 at the International Crops ResearchInstitute<br />for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru (18”N, 78”E), 26 km northwest of<br />Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Details of the experimental site and the 1988 crop<br />seasonwere given by Smith et al. (1992).<br />The soil is a Udic Rhodustalf (I have not checked the books on this but I think the s<br />is applied in the plural sensewhen talking about the family of soils), locally regarded as<br />a crusting, profile hardening soil. The surface texture is a sandy loam merging to a<br />sandy clay loam or light clay alt lo-15 cm and then to gravelly sandy loam overlying<br />mm-rum (a layer of decomposing parent material); the depth of the murmm varies<br />between 30 to 100 cm. ICRISAT has an average rainfall of 784 mm, with over 80%<br />falling between the months of June and October. Rainfall at the experimental site was<br />measuredwith a tipping bucket pluviometer. Average monthly air temperature in the<br />rainy seasonrangesfrom 25 to 29°C.<br />2.2. Experimental design<br />The experimental design was an incomplete randomised block with an embedded<br />factorial for the tillage by mulch comparisons.Each plot was 28 m long (down slope)<br />and 5-m wide with a land slope between M-2.0%. There were three replications.<br />Fifteen treatmentswere imposedin the experiment. These were madeup of: (a) a tillage<br />by mulch factorial for annual crops, comprised nine treatments, and compared three<br />different tillage depths at (0 cm (T,), 10 cm (T,,) and 20 cm (T,,)) and three mulches<br />(no mulch (N,), 15 t ha- ’ farmyard-manure (F,), and 5 t ha-’ rice straw (R, )); (b)<br />perennial crops, which were rotated to annual crops after 4 years comprised six<br />treatments: sole perennial pigeonpea (Pp) (Cajanus cajan L.), sole buffel grass (C)<br />(Cenchrus ciliaris L.), sole Verano (St) (Stylosanthes hamata L.) and mixtures of these<br />speciesviz. PpSt, PpCSt and CSt.<br />Between 1988 and 1991, the tillage and mulch treatments were cropped annually to<br />cereal crops. In 1992, perennial crops were removed and in 1992 and 1993 all<br />treatments, including those previously under perennial crops, were planted to a cereal<br />crop to compare the cumulative effects of different soil management histories. For<br />discussion of the 1992 and 1993, results the perennial treatments are referred to as<br />‘prior-perennial’ treatments when compared with the treatments that been cropped to<br />annual crops before 1992.<br /><br />238<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al. /Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage<br /><br />Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />Data were analysed using GENSTAT (GENSTAT 5 Committee, 1993) with data<br />adjusted to take account of the incomplete block design, prior to analysis. Adjusted<br />means are presented.<br />2.3. Annual crops: (tillage by mulch) factorial<br /><br />The crop sequence was millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) (1988), sorghum (Sorghum<br />bicolor L.) (CSH9) (1989, 1990) maize (Zea mays L.) (Proagro 3448) (1991, 1992) and<br />sorghum (CSHB), (1993). In this paper, we consider the sorghum and maize crops, as<br />Smith et al. (1992) discussed the millet crop.<br />Tillage for T10 and TzO treatments occurred after the first major rain in June and was<br />performed with a tractor-mounted toolbar using chisel tines. The initial tillage operation<br />was 10 cm in both treatments, while a second tillage 10 cm and 20 cm was performed<br />for T,, and T,, treatments respectively. There were a total of two passes in tilled plots.<br />In each year, planting (Table 1) was performed as soon as possible after tillage, but in<br />1989 and 1990 a delay of several weeks occurred because of unfavorable weather<br />conditions. Seeds were sown by hand in a furrow at double the desired plant population<br />and furrows were firmed to promote soil-seed contact. Approximately 20 days after<br />planting, seedlings were thinned to give the desired population (Table 1).<br />Fertiliser was placed in the seed furrow and mixed with soil prior to planting.<br />Nitrogen (N) applications were made 2-3 times during the crop season. Fertiliser<br />(diammonium phosphate and urea) at a rate of(100 kg N ha-’ and 46 kg P ha-‘) was<br />applied over most of the plot and has been designated as the normal fertiliser level (NF).<br />In addition, a high fertiliser (HF) subplot (2 X 2 m) (186 kg N ha-‘, 62 kg P ha-‘, 27<br />kg K ha-‘) was placed at the base of the plot. In 1990, an extra 60 kg N ha-’ and 140<br />kg N ha-’ were applied to the normal and high fertility plots respectively. Zinc was soil<br />applied as 40 kg ha-’ ZnSO, 1990 and as a 2 kg ha -’ foliar spray in 1991, 1992 and<br />1993. In 1992 and 1993, a low fertility (LF) subplot (0 kg N ha-‘, 46 kg P ha-‘) (10<br />rows by 3 m) was placed at the top of each plot to compare the N input from the prior<br />crop.<br />After planting, farmyard-manure (15 t ha-‘) was applied to F, plots and rice straw<br />(5 t ha-‘) was applied to R, plots. Both mulches were applied to the surface and not<br />incorporated. In 1992 and 1993, rice straw was applied to all prior-perennial plots,<br />except PpCSt. The rationale was to prevent the development of a surface seal/crust and<br />therefore allow a comparison of the effect of sub-surface structural changes. The PpCSt<br />treatment did not receive straw so as to be able to measure the effect of a pasture/crop<br />Table 1<br />Crop data for the period<br /><br />between<br /><br />1989 and 1993<br /><br />Year<br /><br />Crop<br /><br />Planting<br /><br />1989<br />1990<br />1991<br />1992<br />1993<br /><br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br />Maize (proagro 3448)<br />Maize (proagro 3448)<br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br /><br />19-7-89<br />12-7-90<br />22-6-91<br />25-6-92<br />30-6-93<br /><br />date<br /><br />Harvest<br />3-11-89<br />6-l l-90<br />18-9-91<br />28-9-92<br />18-10-93<br /><br />date<br /><br />Plant population<br />180,000<br />180,000<br />50,000<br />50,000<br />180,000<br /><br />plants ha-’<br /><br />AL.<br /><br />Cogle et d/Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />239<br /><br />rotation in a non-mulched situation. The farmyard-manure used contained 157 kg N<br />ha-‘, 81 kg P ha-’ and 127 kg K ha-‘, and the rice straw contained 35 kg N ha-‘, 7<br />kgPha-‘and86kgKhaa’.<br />During the cropping period, weeds were removed by hand or by application of the<br />herbicide, (Paraqat (24% Emulsifiable Concentrate (EC)). In 1991, 1992 and 1993,<br />Atrazine (50% EC) was applied as a residual herbicide at planting. To control shootfly<br />(Atherigonia soccatu (Randani)) in 1989, 40 kg ha-’ Carbofuran (3% EC) was mixed<br />with soil in the rows before sowing and was also dribbled in the whorls on August 25. In<br />1990, Fenvalerate (20% EC) was sprayed on July 20 and Carbofuran was dribbled in the<br />whorls on August 25 for shootfly. Endosulphan (35% EC) was sprayed on September 3<br />and Rogor (30% EC) on October 17 for stemborer (Chico partellus<br />(Swinhoe)) and<br />mirid (Calocoris angustutus) attack on sorghum heads. In later years, chemical insect<br />control was not required.<br />Agronomic data collected included total leaf number to the last fully expanded leaf,<br />(three plants from two adjacent centre rows at the top, middle and bottom of each plot),<br />plant population (total counts per replicate plot), projected cover using a camera set at<br />4.2 m above the canopy and analysis of slide photos by projection onto a 10 X 10 cm<br />grid (three sites per replicate plot), and leaf area index with a LICOR LI2000 in 1991<br />and 1992.<br />Crops were harvested at physiological maturity (Table 1) except in 1991. In 1991, the<br />crop was harvested lo-15 days before physiological maturity because a termite attack<br />appeared to potentially affect th,e F, treatment and hence affect treatment comparisons.<br />To ensure a uniform comparison, all treatments were harvested at the same time. The<br />harvest sample unit was 22 m of the central 6 rows of each plot for NF. The HF and LF<br />treatments were sampled entirely. Plants were cut at ground level and separated into<br />grain and fodder (remaining plant material). Grain and fodder yields, grain and fodder<br />nutrients (1991, 1992 and 1993) and 100 seed weights (1991, 1992 and 1993) were<br />determined.<br />2.4. Perennial<br /><br />cvop<br /><br />treatments<br /><br />The perennial species were perennial Pp (C. cajun), a deep rooting shrubby legume;<br />C (C. ciliaris), a clumping vigorous tropical grass; and St (S. hamatu), a tropical pasture<br />legume. The perennial species were sown alone or in mixtures (Pp, PpSt, PpCSt, C, CSt,<br />St).<br />Pp, variety ICPL88040, was sown at 1 m row spacing in July, 1988. Due to high<br />plant mortality (Reddy et al., 1992) variety ICPL9174 was sown in August 1990 and<br />gap filling with ICP11298 occurred in July 1991. As individual plants died in the<br />1991/1992 period, no gap filling was done as Pp was to be removed prior to the 1992<br />kharif or wet season. Fertiliser was applied annually at the rate of 7 kg Zn ha-’ (as<br />ZnSO,), 36 kg S ha-’ and 46 kg Ca ha-’ (as gypsum), 18 kg N ha- ’ (as diammonium<br />phosphate). In 1989, an extra 32 kg N ha-’ (as urea) was applied. Grain and fodder<br />sampling were done between December and April of each year by cutting at 75 cm<br />height; grain was threshed from fodder. Pruning to 75 cm was done during the kharif to<br />check excessive vegetative growth.<br /><br />240<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al./Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />C and St were sown in July and August 1988 in rows at 38 cm spacing. In the<br />mixtures, the species were sown in alternate rows. A similar fertiliser regime as for P<br />was applied. Dry matter harvests were conducted each year (C: 6 July 1989, 16-22<br />September 1989, 21 February 1990, 26-31 July 1990, 15 September 1990, lo-16<br />October 1990, 2-5 July 1991, 3-5 September 1991, 7-10 April 1992; and St: 16-22<br />September 1989, 26-31 July 1990, lo-16 October 1990, 3-5 September 1991, 7-10<br />April 1992). Total plot dry matter was sampled by removing plant material to ground<br />level; air drying and weighing.<br />In the dry season of 1992 (January-May),<br />perennials (Pp, C, St, PpSt, PpCSt and<br />CSt) were removed for sampling and regrowth was controlled by herbicide applications.<br />An outline of the annual crop management for 1992 and 1993 has been given above.<br />2.5. Interaction<br /><br />of soil management, water relations, nutrition and yield<br /><br />An assessment of the effect of increased infiltration on crop growth due to soil<br />management was made by plotting total biomass yield vs. infiltration. Infiltration,<br />calculated as rainfall minus run-off is used as a simple measure of available soil<br />moisture, but takes no account of drainage and soil evaporation. Run-off was measured<br />with tipping buckets at the base of each plot (Smith et al., 1992). In any growing season,<br />there were up to 15 run-off events. The cumulative runoff total was used in calculations<br />for this paper. Total grain and fodder weights were summed to give total biomass. Plots<br />were of treatment averages (each of three replicates). Two relationships were considered: (a) total dry matter for normal fertility vs. infiltration; and (b) total dry matter for<br />low, normal and high fertility vs. infiltration. The latter shows the effect of differing<br />additions of fertiliser, and compares yields from the LF and HF subplots with the larger<br />NF plot. An arbitrary line, which encloses almost all the highest yielding crops at<br />different levels of water use, and thereby defines a linear relation between potential yield<br />and water use, was drawn for each figure, using the technique of French and Schultz<br />(1984). A figure of 110 mm was used as the x intercept as suggested by these authors<br />for growing seasons receiving more than 150 mm. The slope of the arbitrary line is the<br />water use efficiency (Perry, 1987), or in this case, the potential water-use efficiency.<br /><br />3. Results<br />3.1. Rainfall<br />Rainfall distribution varied between cropping seasons (Fig. 1) and there was a<br />substantial difference (236 mm) between the wettest (1989) and driest (1991) cropping<br />season rainfall. In July 1989, exceptionally large rainfalls occurred early in the season<br />over short time periods (e.g., 162 mm over 4 days and 221 mm over 3 days). In 1990,<br />the lack of good planting rains limited establishment and early growth, even though rain<br />was evenly distributed later in the season. The lowest seasonal rainfall was in 1991 and<br />the post anthesis period was particularly dry. The wetter year in 1992 provides a useful<br /><br />A.L.

The notable aspect of 1993<br />was a low but relatively evenly distributed rainfall.<br />3.2. Annual crops (tillage by mulch factorial)<br /><br />1989-1993<br /><br />Mulching (F, and R,) produced significant (P &lt; 0.05) increases in grain yield in all<br />years; there were no significant responses to tillage (data not shown); and the tillage-bymulch interaction was only significant in 1993 (Table 2). Among mulch treatments, F,<br />yielded significantly higher than N, in all years and higher than R, in 1989, 1990 and<br />1993. R, outyielded N, significantly in all years except 1989 when R, produced the<br />lowest yield. There were no significant effects of tillage and mulch treatments on grain<br />yield from high fertility subplots, except in 1992 when mulching (F,, 4716 kg ha-’ and<br />R,, 4675 kg ha-‘)) significantly increased yields (P &lt; 0.05, 484 kg ha-‘) over N,<br />(3448 kg ha-‘).<br />In 1991, maize 100 seed weights were lower (P &lt; 0.05) for N, (14.9 g) compared<br />with F, (16.6 g) and R, (17.0 g) treatments (data not shown). There was no difference<br />in high fertility maize 100 seed weights (15.8 g). In 1992, maize 100 seed weights for<br />F, and R, were significantly higher than N, (P &lt; 0.05) for both fertility levels. The<br />values for normal fertility were 14.9 g (N,), 18.6 g (F,), 18.9 g (R,) and for high<br />fertility 15.7 g (N,), 19.9 g (F,), 20.9 g (R,).

Annual cereals t‘tillage by mulch factorial)<br /><br />1989-1993<br /><br />Grain yields from F, and R, treatments were between 16 and 59% higher than from<br />N, treatments (Table 2). These yield increases for mulched crops are attributed to<br />increased availability of water from improved soil management, as shown by Yule et al.<br />(1991). Although mulching may have provided improved nutrient availability, we<br />believe the dominant influence was increased water supply. Supporting evidence comes<br />from the lack of a yield response to high fertility on F, treatments which suggests that<br />yields under the equivalent normal fertility regime in F, were not limited by N, P or K.<br />Similarly, the increase in R, treatments was only marginal (Table 2) following the high<br />fertility fertiliser applications, although yields in N, did respond to higher fertility.<br />While there may have been a nutrient contribution from the rice straw, we consider that<br />the contribution from the annual application would have little effect on nutrient<br />availability in the current year, given the low N percentage of the straw (0.7% N). The<br />low grain and fodder N concentrations in R, crops support this. We therefore suggest<br />that improved infiltration in F, and R, treatments was the major reason for increased<br />yields and that further fertiliser addition to R, treatments would have consistently<br />achieved yields similar to F,.<br />Plant growth rate was greater in mulched crops as shown by greater LA1 (Fig. 2) and<br />plant height in sorghum and maize from F, and R, treatments. Lower 100 seed weights<br />for N, treatments provide further support for poorer growth under unmulched conditions. A delay in plant growth in a soil and water conservation context impacts on the<br />speed at which the crop can provide soil surface protection from raindrop impact.<br />Hence, benefits of mulching (a.s shown in F, and R,) to the soil surface as cover and<br />organic matter for aggregate stability (Cogle et al., 1995b), interact with faster crop<br />canopy development to provide improved water conservation.<br />The yield increases show the strong potential for increased production using mulches.<br />The increased fodder production provides support for the contention (Unger et al., 1991;<br />Cupta and Moncreif, 1994) that management practices using mulching can be implemented using straw derived from the increased on-farm production (i.e., applying a<br />proportion of the fodder produced in any year). In many countries, including India<br />(Kelley et al., 1993), straw has considerable financial value and increased fodder<br />production is crucial for acceptance of management practices, that promote organic<br />matter retention. Similarly, faumyard-manure has alternative uses (fuel, construction,<br />mulching) but is perceived as beneficial to soil structure by Indian farmers (Motivalli<br />and Anders, 1991) and increased grain and fodder production obtained from F,,,<br />mulching will further enhance its value as a mulch. However, farmyard manure does<br />vary in quality depending on its source and its method of collection (Probert et al., 1992;<br />Motivalli and Anders, 1991) and this may affect crop and soil response in any one year.<br />It should be noted, that to maximise the benefit of mulching, farmyard-manure should be<br />applied as a mulch and should not be incorporated into the soil.<br />While our results show no benefit of tillage, weed control was achieved using<br />herbicides and hand weeding, which is a form of interrow cultivation. Where weed<br /><br />250<br /><br />A. L. Cogle et al. /Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />control in farmers fields involves interrow cultivation, which may break surface crusts,<br />infiltration may be greater than in our experiment. Such tillage incurs short and long<br />term costs. Our results show the potential benefits of soil structural modification by<br />mulches, either from surface soil protection or the development of a favorable soil<br />structure (macropore development, surface aggregatestability) (Cogle et al., 1995b), and<br />presumably soil water environment for root proliferation, when mulches are used.<br />4.2. Annual cereals (following 4 years of perennials) 1992-1993<br />Grain yields of maize grown in prior-perennial treatments yielded between 14 and<br />81% more than the unmulched treatment (N,), with one exception. The exception was<br />maize from the low fertility C treatment which showed a yield depression,probably due<br />to severe nutrient deficiency causedby exploitation of the soil nutrient reserve by the<br />only non legume perennial, C. ciliaris; and perhaps an immobilising effect causedby<br />slowly decomposinggrassroots and remaining tops.<br />The grain yield benefit in prior-perennial treatments which were unmulched during<br />the maize crop was between 19 and 25% for normal and high fertility treatments over<br />the N, treatment. The important aspect of this result is that the treatment (unmulched<br />prior-perennial-PpCSt) which would be more likely to be adopted as an innovation in<br />farm situationsstill yielded more than the treatment most resemblingfarmer practice. As<br />shown in other papers(Littleboy et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1992; Yule et al., 1991; Cogle<br />et al., 1996) benefits would also apply to resourceprotection and hence the pasture/crop<br />rotation has potential in regions where grazing animals are part of the agricultural<br />system.<br />The N contribution of perennialsto the first subsequentcereal crop can be examined<br />by comparing maize grown in Pp, PpSt, C, CSt, and St with T,R,; and maize grown in<br />PpCSt with T,N, (and similarly for sorghum for the second subsequentcrop). There<br />was no yield improvement for maize grown after perennials, if straw was applied,<br />indeed N levels were similar for all straw mulched maize regardlessof the prior crop;<br />similarly for sorghumin 1993. Maize yields from PpCSt plots were significantly higher<br />(P &lt; 0.05) than T,N, in normal fertility treatments, however there was no difference at<br />other fertility levels or in the secondyear when sorghumwas grown. Further, the N% of<br />maize and sorghumfrom PpCSt plots was little different to F, and N, treatments. This<br />provides further evidence that increased water availability was the main contributing<br />factor in yield improvement following mulching or perennial/annual crop rotations, and<br />that N from prior-perennial crops was not a large yield contributor.<br />4.3. Interaction of soil management,water relations, N and yield<br />The potential water use efficiency (WUE) of 42.538 kg ha-’ mm-‘, defined by the<br />slope of the arbitrary line relationship between NF yield and infiltration, is in the range<br />reported by other authors (Perry, 1987). As discussedpreviously, increased yield is<br />positively related to improved crop water supply. Our arbitrary line drawn at the top of<br />the envelope of points, similar to that of French and Schultz (19X4), shows that some<br />treatments were yielding substantially below their yield potential. The straw mulched<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al./Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />251<br /><br />treatment (R,) was noticeable in this regard and perhaps produced below its potential<br />due to an N limitation, as imglied by the lower grain N percentages. The WUE<br />relationship also showed the unmulched treatments (N,) were growing almost to their<br />potential WUE, even though the N, treatments responded the most in percent yield<br />terms to the HF treatment. Difficulties with the sorghum pest, shootfly, help explain the<br />poor WUE relationships for the 1989 data.<br />Inclusion of all fertility treatments (LF, NF, HF) (Fig. 4) illustrates that an yield<br />improvements occurred to a certain degree with added nutrition in yield, although they<br />were generally not significant (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, but the same line enclosed the<br />expanded set of data, which indicates either that nutrition was adequate or that other<br />nutrients beside N were limiting. While we are more confident with the NF yield<br />compared to the LF and HF yield vs. infiltration data, due to smaller plot sizes for the<br />latter, this is an important finding in so much as it emphasises that yield increases were<br />due principally to improvements in water availability, via soil management, rather than<br />nutritional effects. Further investigations to confirm our findings should consider the<br />influence of different N rates, and other nutrients on full size plots to provide a better<br />understanding of the water and nutrient interactions that influence yield in this situation.<br /><br />5. Conclusion<br />Our aim in analysing the interactions between soil management, water relations, and<br />N was to broadly identify the driving factors for yield improvement in Alfisols in the<br />SAT environment. This analysis suggests that water availability, as influenced by mulch<br />treatment through reduced run-off, was the critical factor. The effect of three N rates (0,<br />100, and 186 kg N ha- ’ &gt; were also considered, although only the effect of 100 kg N<br />ha-’ rate could be linked to water availability due to run-off plot size. Further<br />investigations should consider the influence of different N rates, and other nutrients, on<br />the development of the crop canopy and consequent water conservation for different<br />mulches to provide a fuller understanding of the water and nutrient interactions that<br />influence yield. These investigations should consider a broad range of N levels, both<br />below and above 100 kg N ha-‘. In the Indian situation, the effects of differing levels of<br />residue retention need to be determined to place a monetary value on retention to<br />compare to the market value as fodder. Experimentation is also needed to determine<br />optimum mixtures of retention, nutrition and mulching and the timing of the mulch<br />effect viz it is possible to remove mulch for other purposes sometime during the crop<br />cycle.<br />These results provide key data for the development of simulation models so that<br />predictions can be made of the long term impact of soil management on crop yields and<br />economic returns. Initial attempts were made by Cogle and Rao (1994), but further<br />development is necessary usin g models calibrated both for soil management and N<br />nutrition. The development of these types of models requires greater emphasis for SAT<br />environments as both water and N are major limiting factors. Studies such as those by<br />Littleboy et al. (1992, 1996) and Carberry et al. (1992) provide the necessary basis for<br />these developments.<br /><br />252<br /><br />A.L.

The objective of this study was to provide appropriate physiological indicators to describe plant performance under P deficiency early in the vegetative cycle of the annual non-cultivated (Sw) D.C. and the perennial Cajanus cajan (L.) Mlllsp grown inside a highly ventilated greenhouse in 950-mL pots with sand irrigated with either 1.0 (T1) or 0.01 (T2) nM P in the Hoagland solution for a period of 35 or 45 days when growth pressure made differences between P treatments apparent. Results indicated that total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), but not relative leaf area expansion rate (RLAER), were drastically reduced in T2 plants in both species and that root length was reduced by 50% in Desmodium severely stressed T2 plants. The activity of acid phosphatase secreted by the roots in vivo increased under P deficiency in both species. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) of the seemed enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk linear plots were different for the enzyme from T1 or T2 plants in both species. The numerical value of the Km for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-P provided a means of comparing the enzyme from high- or low-P plants, and it is suggested that Km, enzyme activity (Vmax), total leaf area and RGR (during exponential growth), may be used as physiological indicators to differentiate plants grown under P deficiency or sufficiency.","1996","2015-06-03 01:43:19","2015-06-03 08:44:27","","1971-1993","","5/8","27","","Commun.

At 50% FC the critical concentrations were higher than at FC.<br /><br />Introduction<br />One of the features of sustainable agriculture is its lower dependence on chemical fertilizer and recycling of on-farm residues to maintain or improve fertility of the soils (Parr et al. 1990). Earlier studies have shown that organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in soil increased due to addition of corn stalks (Larson et al. 1972), wheat straw (Black, 1973), loppings (leaves and twigs) of Leucaena leucocephala (Narkhede et al. 1984; Subba Reddy et al. 1991).<br />However, the C/N ratio of the crop residues is important in governing the rate of N cycling that occurs. This is more relevant where crop residues are used to supplement fertilizer N either<br /><br />in part or as a whole. Crop residues with C/N ratio below 30 are expected to result in net N mineralization, whereas C/N ratio wider than 30 favour immobilization (Alexander, 1977; Harmsen and Van Schreven, 1955). If immobilization occurs, at least a portion of the immobilized N will be bound very strongly and this probably will not be readily available to plants (Scherer and Mengel, 1983). Apart from C/N ratio, moisture availability also plays an important role in the process in N mineralization (Parr and Papendick, 1978).<br />Keeping in view the importance of residue management for the N supply in sustainable agriculture in drylands, the present study was conducted to estimate N availability as related to<br /><br />210<br /><br />the duration of decomposition and chemical composition of the residues under two soil moisture availability conditions.<br />Materials and methods<br />Surface soil (0-15 cm depth) used in the investigation was collected from Hayathnagar Research Farm of Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad (78°36' E longitude and 17o18' N latitude). The soil of the research farm is red loamy sand representing Alfisol and related soil order with pH6.0 (1:2 soil:water suspension). Before incubation, the soil sample was air dried, stubble and root were removed by hand and crushed gently to pass through 2mm sieve.<br />Five locally available crop residues were collected, air dried and ground to pass through 0.25mm sieve (Table 1). Complete above ground portions of sorghum and mungbean after removing the reproductive parts were used. Loppings of Leucaena leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea were collected from 3 and 2 year old plants, respectively. Groundnut seeds were removed from the pods, and the shells were used. In addition to crop residues, farm yard manure (FYM) collected from the research station manure pit was used as one of the treatments. An unamended control soil, without any residue addition was also incubated. Total C and N contents in the residues were estimated by wet digestion method of Walkley and Black (1934) and micro-Kjeldahl method (Piper, 1966), respectively.<br />Residues and FYM were added to a 2 kg soil in an amount to supply 40 kg N ha -1. To arrive at this value, per cent N content of the residues on oven dry basis and amount (2.24 x 106 k g h a -1) of soil present in furrow slice of<br /><br />plough layer (0-15cm) were used. After thorough mixing, the soil + residue mixture was transferred to glass jars. Water was added to obtain FC (12.5% V/V) and 50% FC (8.4% V/ V). Each treatment had three replications. Incubation was carried out under aerobic conditions in an incubator at 28-+ 1°C. The mouth of the glass jars were covered by pieces of muslin cloth. To maintain soil moisture at FC and 50% FC, water was added in alternate days to compensate for what was lost by evaporation. The incubation reaction was allowed for 120 days, sub-soil samples were taken at 10 days interval. Nitrogen in soil was estimated by alkaline permanganate method where chemical N availability index was NHe-N released on distillation with alkaline KMnO 4 (Bremner, 1965; Subbiah and Asija, 1956). Net N release from residues was calculated by subtracting the values of the unamended soil from the N estimated for residue-treated soils. Models for predicting N release were fitted through SYSTAT statistical software package (SYSTAT, 1985). Mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates was determined by dry sieving method (Van Bavel, 1949) at 120 days of incubation.<br />Results and discussion<br />Nitrogen release<br />Nitrogen availability in soil increased with time of incubation. Linear regression equations between estimated N and time of incubation were fitted. Coefficients of determinations (R2) were significant at both 50% FC and FC moisture conditions with all the residues used in the study except mungbean stover at FC (Table 2a and b). Addition of sorghum stover resulted in decrease of available N over control upto about 90 days,<br /><br />Table 1.

Among the residues, mungbean released higher N. The performance of L. leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea was similar, next to mungbean. Further, the slopes of the regression equations revealed that rate of release of N was generally higher with decrease in N concentration of the residues. Concentration of available N was higher at FC than at 50% FC in all the cases studied. The significance of the best fitted linear equations is that the model can be used to estimate the amount of N expected to be available at a given time of incubation.<br />Percent N released and N concentration of the residues<br />The relationship between percent N released (of total N of the residues) at different time intervals and the square root of the N concentration of the organic residues was significant at 50% FC and<br /><br />FC conditions (Table 3). However, at FC, the values for R 2 were not significant at 30 and 120 days incubation periods. From the slope of the regression equations, it is evident that N released per unit square root of N concentration decreased with increase in period of incubation at both the moisture conditions. The critical N factors, defined as the N concentration at which neither N release nor immobilization would occur, were found to vary between 10.3 to 0 . 3 g k g -I at FC and 13.7 to 0 . 2 g k g -1 at 50% FC at 28 + 1°C. The values decreased with increase in incubation period. The critical N factor at 35°C for 28 days interval was reported to range from 16.6 to 20.0gkg -1 (Iritani and Arnold, 1959). The value for N factor as low as 8.0 g kg 1has been calculated by Vigil and Kissel (1991) for 140 days incubation period at 23°C from the data reported by Frankenberger and Abdelmagid (1985).

Though the equation was computed from the data of five crop residues, yet 63.5-87.7 and 81.4-93.0% of the variability in the measured amount of N at FC and 50% FC, respectively could be explained using these relationships.<br />Percent N released and C / N ratios<br />Percent N released from the total N of the residues at 30, 60 and 90 days of incubation intervals was negatively correlated with C/N<br /><br />ratios at both 50% FC and FC moisture conditions. The coefficients of determination (R z) of linear regression model were found significant for 30, 60 and 90 days incubation periods at both the moisture conditions. However, significant relationship was not observed at 120 days incubation at either of the moisture regimes (Table 4). Per cent N released per unit C/N ratio decreased with the incubation period at both the moisture regimes. The magnitude of the coefficients of determination (R 2) of regression equations at 1% level of significance confirmed the higher degree of fitness of the prediction models upto 90 days of incubation periods.<br /><br />Table 4.

A C/N ratio of 40 which corresponds to a N concentration of about 10gkg -t residue (assuming residue C is 400 g kg 1) has been reported as the break point between mineralization and immobilization for a crop growing season (Vigil and Kissel, 1991). The increasing trend of critical C / N ratios with incubation periods is indicative of the fact that even the residues possessing higher C/N ratios could be used, provided enough time is permitted for decomposition reaction. This model would have great implication in residue management under intensive cropping systems.<br />The influence of the addition of organic residues on MWD of soil aggregates, studied at the end of 120 days incubation period indicated the importance of organic residues in ameliorating the physical condition of the soil (Fig. 1). Maintaining moisture at FC resulted in increased MWD as compared to 50% FC. Use of loppings of perennial pigeonpea was most effective in increasing the MWD of soil aggregates at both the moisture conditions. Earlier Campbell et al. (1986) found that manure application had the effect of stabilizing soil aggregation, probably through the production of humic colloids.

Polymers produced by bacteria may be adsorbed by soil surface and microorganisms may bind soil particles by adsorbing to them (Tisdall and Oades, 1982).<br />Discussion and conclusion<br />In this investigation we had the intention to find out the pattern of release of N from residues under varying soil moisture conditions by estimating N by alkaline KMnO 4 method as a chemical index of N availability. The difference in measured N between the treated and unamended treatment gave the quantity of net N released due to crop residue incorporation in soil. Nitrogen released or immobilized eg. at 30 days of incubation at 50% FC can be determined from the equations presented in Table 2a. Nitrogen immobilization with sorghum stover application alone was thus evident. Similar derivations can be made for a given time (up to 120 days) under either of the soil moisture regimes using the equations presented in Table 2b.<br />Although the results of the incubation study conducted at near optimum conditions with finely ground residues may not reflect the pattern under field conditions, nevertheless, it will provide some understanding about the residue decomposition and N release. It is evident that incorporation of non-leguminous residue with wide C / N ratio, viz. sorghum will lead to N unavailability due to immobilization during a greater part of crop growth. Eventually, this residue N might not be available to crop but may depress the yield due to immobilization of soil N. Addition of adequate fertilizer N along with sorghum residue may thus be called for to offset the immobilization effect. Higher release of N, as was seen from the slopes of the regression equations in Table 2b, with organic residues containing lower N concentration might have been due to higher availability of substrates for microbial proliferation. In this study organic residues were added to supply 4 0 k g N h a -1. Consequently, the amount of organic C that was added was more with lower N concentration materials.<br /><br />214<br />Leguminous residues, viz. mungbean stover, loppings of perennial pigeonpea and L. leucocephala, and groundnut shell affected net N release from the beginning and can be used for raising crops. Similar findings were also reported by Smith and Sharpley (1990). It has to be seen experimentally whether these sources alone can meet the N demand of the crops or supplementation with fertilizer N would be required. N availability pattern, as observed under 50% FC, provided information regarding the possibility of use of these residues under dryland conditions where crops often experience sub-optimal water supply. The observation on release of N from materials having C / N ratio less than 30 is in agreement with the suggestion of Alexander (1977).<br />The relationship of estimated N with N concentration or C/N ratio as a function of time and moisture availability has helped to predict the expected N flux replenishing the N availability pool based on N concentration and C/N ratio of the residues. We have worked out the expected NH]-N mineralized plus that oxidizable labile pool of N ( N H e - N ) which is anticipated during the crop growth period at different times, viz. 30, 60, 90 and at 120 days of incubation under two moisture situations. The available N content will increase with time, N concentration of residues and at higher moisture availability (FC). Stanford and Epstein (1974) related soil water content to the amounts of N mineralized under various soils and cropping systems. With water contents between 60 and 100% of field capacity, the rates of decomposition of residues and transformation of nutrients were greatest (Power and Legg, 1978). In this investigation we have observed that the critical C/N ratios, below which release of N and above which immobilization would occur were 46 and 39 at FC and 50% FC, respectively. Two points are interesting to note i) critical C / N ratio is higher than the generally believed ratio of about 30, and ii) release of N can occur in residue containing wider C/N ratio at FC than at 50%FC moisture. It was also observed that N release would occur even with the wider C/N ratios, provided adequate time for decomposition is allowed, as microbial immobilization would be greater at initial stages after organic addition. This was true both under FC and 50% FC conditions.<br /><br />Acknowledgements<br />This research was supported by the USIF Grant<br />(No. FG-IN-717, IN-ARS-677) under the Indo-<br />US collaborative research on dryland agriculture<br />sponsored by USDA/OICD/FERRO.

Despite their importance in food production for the growing populations of this region, productivity of these soils has remained low and unstable owing to climate- and soil-related contraints (Swindale, 1982 ). The climate-related constraints include short rainy seasons, variability in the timing and amount of rainfall, high intensity rains resulting in high runoff, high temperatures, and high rates of evaporation (Kampen, 1980; Virmani et al., 1980; Sivakumar et al., 1987 ). Many Alfisols have soil physical characteristics that increase the impact of poor seasonal conditions. For example, the low strength of saturated soil leads to surface sealing under raindrop impact, slumping of surface roughness, and high soil erodibility by water; high sand or gravel content reduces plant available water capacity; an argillic horizon in the shallow subsoil acts as a throttle to water movement; weathered parent material (murrum) restricts root proliferation; and soil strength often increases markedly as the soil dries (hardsetting; Mullins et al., 1987, 1990) which restricts tillage effects, seedling emergence and root system development (Arndt, 1965; El-Swaify et al., 1984, 1985, 1987). The high strength of dry soil makes preparation of a seedbed very difficult until rain softens the soil. The combination of climate and soil factors means there is usually a very narrow 'window of opportunity' when crops can be successfully established. Furthermore, farmers in the SAT usually have very limited resources at their disposal.<br />Although there has been research on land management practices to resolve these problems there is as yet no technology for optimising the productivity of Alfisols under rainfed conditions. EI-Swaify et al. (1984) concluded that an improved land use system will be technically feasible if it satisfies some of the following interrelated objectives: ( 1) improved water use efficiency and access to available resources; (2) maintained or enhanced soil fertility; (3) improved soil aggregation and reduced surface sealing and crusting; (4) decreased runoff and soil erosion; (5) increased structural stability of the soil;<br /><br />RUNOFF AND EROSION REDUCTION ON A HARDSETTING ALFISOL<br /><br />197<br /><br />(6) reduced pest and disease incidence. They also conclude that component research is essential for an understanding of the general principles, and for indicating how location-specific land use systems may be tailored to suit contrasting Alfisol regions. E1-Swaify et al. (1984) advocated priority for research on runoff and soil loss, the role of tillage, soil structure, methods of enhancing and maintaining soil organic matter, and alternative land use systems including agroforestry and grass/legume ley farming.<br />Soil management in rainfed cropping systems for Alfisols should aim to ensure that soil physical properties at the start of the wet season favour effective water entry and storage, easy seedbed preparation, and low-risk crop establishment. In essence, infiltration is the key process. If infiltration rate is adequate, water storage is maximised and runoff, with concomitant soil erosion, is minimised. While soil erosion threatens sustainability of Alfisol production systems (Sanchez, 1976), this threat is posed by the cumulative effect of many runoff events. Management practices that change soil structure to maximise infiltration will, by increasing wet soil strength, also reduce the erodibility of the soil when runoff does occur. Such practices are likely to be acceptable to farmers because they help them meet their short-term production goals and promote the long-term stability of the system.<br /><br />Optionsfor improvedland management<br /><br />Tillage<br />Primary and secondary tillage requirements depend on the properties of the particular soil and seasonal conditions. In the main, the benefits of tillage are due to better seedbeds, better root growth, improved water storage and weed control (E1-Swaify et al., 1984, 1985, 1987). Deep tillage can reduce soil bulk density and strength in the argillic subsoil and promote root system development, but the yield response depends on soil features, seasonal conditions, crop type, time of sowing and soil fertility (Charreau and Fauck, 1970; Charreau and Nicou, 1971; Charreay, 1972; Nicou and Chopart, 1979; Vittal et al., 1983; Vijayalakshmi, 1987; Chopart, 1989). Dry-season tillage has been shown to increase yield, probably because it presents an open, porous surface that traps and absorbs the early rains (Hadimani and Perur, 1971; Hadimani et al., 1982; Hoogmoed, 1987; Sinclair, 1987). It may also control weeds (Hegde et al., 1987; Sinclair, 1987) and mineralize nitrogen. Cogle et al. ( 1991 ) compared zero tillage and reduced tillage on an Alfisol in northern Australia, and found that weed control by tillage was more reliable than by herbicides.<br />Despite its benefits, tillage is often physically difficult for SAT farmers and it takes time and energy. Also, the beneficial effects on soil structure may be shortlived. Awadhwal and Smith (1990) found that bulk density and strength of the tilled layer of an Alfisol at Patancheru reverted to pre-tillage values<br /><br />198 G.D. SMITH ETAL.<br />within three or four wetting and drying cycles. Sinclair (1987) found that tillage improved early growth but did not increase grain yield in the season studied because the crop exhausted the additional soil water before grain-filling. He also found that tillage, if followed by wetting, increased crust strength. This may have resulted from closer particle packing and enhanced interparticle bonding if clay content in the soil surface was increased due to soil inversion. It may also have been due to soil shearing during tillage increasing susceptibility of clay particles to dispersion (Emerson, 1983). As clay content increases in sandy soils, size and density of aggregates also increase (Smith et al., 1978 ). Farmers in the SAT sometimes spread sand on the surface to improve soil physical properties (Sachan and Smith, 1989). On the other hand, Pathak et al. ( 1987 ) used shallow, non-inverting tillage to increase illuviation of fine particles and thus raise the coarse sand content of the surface layer, thereby improving physical characteristics. Also, Hamblin (1984), Burch et al. ( 1986 ), and Chan and Mead ( 1988 ) concluded from direct drilling studies on structurally unstable, light textured, soils in southern Australia, that soil structural stability and infiltration were generally improved if soil was not disturbed.<br />Although tillage increases the porosity of the tilled layer, soil shearing may destroy continuity of macropores extending below the tilled layer (Ehlers, 1975). Whereas Vertisols have structure rebuilding capabilities due to the activity of clay minerals (Coughlan, 1984; Smith, 1984), Alfisols are essentially rigid and damage to soil structure may be permanent. Macrofauna may play a vital role in creating continuous macropores in such soils (Blackwell and Blackwell, 1989 ). However, tillage discourages soil macrofauna (Abbott et al., 1979 ). Organic carbon levels are relatively low in Alfisols of the SAT (Jones, 1973; E1-Swaify et al., 1987). This suggests that fertility and structural stability will also be low in these soils. Dalai and Mayer ( 1986 ) found that soil organic matter declined in tilled Vertisols in the subtropics of Queensland. Therefore, there is little prospect that organic matter levels can be increased in Alfisols under tillage-based systems. Thus, tillage is a shortterm remedy for physical problems, but it may aggravate these problems in the long term. In essence it creates a cycle of decline in which tillage increases the need for tillage to maintain infiltration capacity.<br />Surface configurations<br />Surface configurations, such as tied ridges, can be used to trap water on the soil surface when rainfall rate exceeds infiltration rate (Lawes, 1961, 1963, 1966; Pereira et al., 1967; Dagg and Macartney, 1968). Because surface roughness soon disappears on structurally unstable soils, it is usually necessary to reform the configurations at the start of each rainy season, an operation that normally is most effective after the soil has been loosened by both primary and secondary tillage operations. Surface configurations are there-<br /><br />RUNOFF AND EROSION REDUCTION ON A HARDSETTING ALFISOL<br /><br />199<br /><br />fore unlikely to be useful to promote effectiveness of early wet season rains. Their main use will be to improve water storage during the crop-growing season. However, if infiltration rate is so low (or rain so frequent) that water ponding on the surface induces waterlogging, surface configurations can have a detrimental effect on crop growth (Lawes, 1963; Dagg and Macartney, 1968; Kowal, 1970; Perrier, 1987 ).<br /><br />Biological agents<br />Plants or plant remains influence soil biological activity by providing protection and a food source. Several authors have reported benefits from surface mulching (Lal, 1975; Gupta and Gupta, 1986; E1-Swaify et al., 1987; Perrier, 1987 ). It is often assumed that mulches or surface litter take the place of crop or natural vegetation canopy in protecting the soil from raindrop impact (Lal et al., 1980; Bridge et al., 1983a). In hardsetting soils, permeability may be intrinsically low. Hence, protecting the soil against raindrop impact might have little effect. Bridge et al. (1983b) considered that surface litter and its effect on soil macrofauna was a key factor in regeneration of soil structure under pastures in Alfisols in northern Australia. Not only does the litter protect the surface against raindrop impact and reduce the rate of runoff, but it also modifies soil temperature and drying (Bristow, 1988; Bristow and Abrecht, 1989 ), and provides a food source for soil fauna.<br />Incorporation of organic amendments such as farmyard manure (FYM) and green manure crops has also been shown to improve yield and soil physical properties (Biswas et al., 1964; Charreau and Fauck, 1970; Bairathi et al., 1974; Venkateswarlu, 1987 ). This raises the question of whether it is better to leave organic materials on the surface or to incorporate them in the soil. Incorporation mixes the material within the soil and protects it from foraging animals. By stimulating microbial activity it should maximise the formation of structure-stabilising organic bonds. However, the amounts of organic materials available for return to the soil in the SAT are usually small, and the evidence suggests that trends in soil organic carbon in tillage-based systems are downwards (Dalai and Mayer, 1986). Because tillage also discourages soil macrofauna, incorporation is unlikely to maximise the overall benefits that might be available from biological agencies. For maximum benefits from a limited amount of organic material, it should be placed where it influences water entry processes in the immediate surface. It should protect the surface from raindrop impact, slow runoff, enrich the organic content and structural stability of the immediate surface, and encourage soil fauna. Because continuous macropores are important for water entry, the aim should be to provide a suitable habitat so that macrofauna will create a macropore network extending through the zone of poor physical properties. If this network is not disturbed by tillage, and humic materials are preferentially distributed around<br /><br />200 G.D. SMITH ET AL.<br />the pores and relict root channels, soil structural problems may be circumvented. Mulch or leaf litter on the soil surface may provide such a habitat. In addition, surface mulches, by reducing sediment movement, can also prevent clogging of macropores by sediment (Loch et al., 1987 ).<br />This approach has been successfully used in the humid tropics (Lal, 1975, 1977a, 1977b), but biological agents may be less effective in the drier climate of the SAT (EI-Swaify et al., 1984, 1987 ). However, during the rainy season the moisture regime is favourable, and biological agencies may be able to be exploited at the time when it is most important to influence physical and crop growth processes. The role of plant roots (particularly in a pasture ley) in defining pore structure and aggregates in soils is well known (Clarke et al., 1967; Stephens, 1967; Wilkinson and Aina, 1976 ). A legume ley (for examples see Akobundu, 1982; McCown, 1987 ) might improve soil structure due to the effect of roots, soil fauna and microbes, fix nitrogen and increase soil fertility. Also, the root systems of perennial species used for agroforestry may be able to pioneer openings for the roots of later crops to penetrate restrictive subsoil layers (HulugaUe and Lal, 1986; Smith et al., 1991 ).<br />Clearly there is a need for farming systems that rely less on tillage and are low-cost and risk-averse. Several options are available as components of an improved technology, but in many cases it is difficult to select an option because its effects on important processes are unknown. Several authors (for example, E1-Swaify et al., 1984, 1985, 1987; McCown, 1987; Patil, 1987; Singh and Das, 1987 ) allude to the need for research on systems that are biologically-based and ecologically sustainable. In 1988 an experiment to compare biologically-based systems with tillage-based systems and to measure longterm effects on important physical processes was started on a hardsetting A1fisol at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) at Hyderabad, India. This paper describes the experiment and summarises results for the establishment phase in the 1988 season. Some results from 1989 and 1990 are presented by Yule et al. (1990) and Yule et al. (1992).<br />MATERIALSAND METHODS<br />The experimental site<br />The experiment was established in July 1988 in the field designated RM 19B on the research farm at the ICRISAT Centre at Patancheru ( 18 °N, 78 °E) 26 km northwest of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. The cropping history before 1976 is not known. From 1976 to 1981 the rainy season cropping se-<br />quence was pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum )/pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan ) intercrop, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sesbania (Sesbania spp.), sorghum,<br />pigeonpea, sorghum/pigeonpea intercrop. During this time nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers were applied; in total 208 kg ha- ~of N and 206 kg ha<br /><br />RUNOFF AND EROSION REDUCTION ON A HARDSETTINGALFISOL<br /><br />201<br /><br />of P205 were applied. From 1982 to 1986 the field was under weedy grass fallow in the rainy season followed by dry season tillage; in the 1987 rainy season it was cropped to maize; 20 kg ha- 1of N and 20 kg ha- 1of P20~ were applied (D.S. Bisht, personal communication, 1987). Maize residues were incorporated by disc tillage in December 1987. The slope on the land surface is in the range 1.5-2.0%.<br /><br />Soil type<br /><br />The soil belongs to the Patancheru series which is a member of the clayeyskeletal, mixed, isohyperthermic family of Udic Rhodustalfs (Murthy et al., 1982 ). Analytical data on this soil type are tabulated by E1-Swaify et al. ( 1985, 1987 ). The soil at the trial site is locally regarded as a crusting, profile-hardening soil. The textural profile consists of a sandy loam merging to sandy clay loam or light clay at 10-15 cm and then to gravelly sandy loam overlying murrum (parent material) rich in quartz gravel at depths ranging from 30 to 70 cm. It is formed on weathered granite-gneiss.<br /><br />Climate<br /><br />Mean annual rainfall at the ICRISAT Centre is 784 mm. Over 80% of rain (on average) falls between June and October, with a slightly bimodal distribution. Average monthly air temperature in the rainy season ranges from 25 to 29°C (Sivakumar et al., 1987).<br /><br />Trial design<br /><br />The design is an incomplete randomised block with an embedded factorial (Murari Singh, personal communication, 1987 ). There are three tillage treatments and three mulch treatments (cropped annually) in the factorial plus an additional six perennial species treatments (with no annual tillage or mulching). There are three replicates of each of the 15 treatments (listed in Table 4, see further on). Analysis of variance can be carried out within the factorial to show the effects of tillage depth and mulch or within the randomised block to compare all treatments. Plots are 5 m wide by 28.5 m long and 1.5 m apart. They are enclosed by a sheet metal strip embedded 10 cm into, and projecting l0 cm above the soil to define the catchment area.<br /><br />Tillage treatments<br /><br />Tillage depths were 0, 10 and 20 cm (referred to as To, Tlo and T2o respectively). The tillage implement used for tillage to 10 cm consisted of duckfeet tines spaced to give complete soil disturbance. Tines were chosen for tillage<br /><br />202 G.D. SMITH El"" AL.<br />because they cause soil disturbance similar to that of the wooden country plough used by Indian farmers. Tines were mounted on a tractor-drawn toolbar and Tlo and T2o plots were subjected t o o n e pass with the depth set at 10 cm. Chisel tines, 4 cm wide and spaced 60 cm apart, were passed once through T20 plots after the shallow tillage operation. These chisel tines had been used earlier at ICRISAT in tillage studies with bullock-drawn equipment. Hence, although a tractor was used, the soil disturbance during deep tillage was consistent with that resulting from using animal traction power. Tillage operations were carded out in mid-July after the soil had been softened by rain. The tillage was carded out as late as possible before sowing and there was no secondary tillage apart from the disturbance associated with sowing.<br />Mulch treatments<br />Mulch treatments were either no mulch (Nm), rice (Oryza sativa) straw<br />(cut at ground level and carried from a nearby field) at 5 t ha -1 (Rm), or FYM (from ICRISAT bullock shed, applied air dry) at 15 t ha -1 (Fm). Rice straw was used because it provides a high surface area per unit weight and, by comparison with sorghum straw, it is not as much in demand for other uses. Lal et al. (1980) found that rice straw increased soil fauna activities in an Alfisol in Nigeria when applied as a mulch at 6 and 10 t ha -1. Farmyard manure was applied at the relatively high rate of 15 t h a - l because 5 t h a applied over 8 years had no visible effect on soil structure on a similar soil (K.L. Sahrawat, personal communication, 1987 ). No mulch materials were applied to the perennial species ley treatments. The mulch treatments were applied within 10 days after sowing, as surface cover between the rows of emerging seedlings in the tillage treatments. The materials were not mechanically incorporated into the soil. This was to ensure that the soil surface was protected from temperature extremes, from raindrop impact and to provide a suitable habitat for soil fauna. Because the immediate soil surface controls many physical processes, concentrating the materials on the surface should maximise their effect in the critical early stages of the rainy season.<br />Perennial species ley treatments<br />Species selected for use, alone or in combinations as shown in Table 4, were<br />buffel grass ( Cenchrus ciliaris), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata) and per-<br />ennial pigeonpea. Perennial pigeonpea was selected because of the beneficial effect of pigeonpea on the subsequent crop (Kumar Rao et al., 1983), the promise shown by the perennial cultivars for use in agroforestry systems, and its ability to develop roots into the murrum (R.P. Singh and C.K. Ong, personal communication, 1987). Buffel grass and verano were selected on the basis of their earlier good performance in observation trials at ICRISAT<br /><br />RUNOFF AND EROSION REDUCTION ON A HARDSETTING ALFISOL<br /><br />203<br /><br />(M.M. Sharma, personal communication, 1987) and on Alfisols in India (R.P. Singh, and Y.P. Singh, personal communication, 1987 ). The effects of these species on soil structure were not known, but it was considered preferable to use species that might be acceptable to farmers on the basis of productivity of high-quality fodder rather than those renowned for their effects on soil structure. Verano fixes appreciable amounts of nitrogen and was the basis of ley pasture systems used on Alfisols in northern Australia by McCown (1987) and Cogle et al. ( 1991 ). Bridge et al. (1983b) found that verano and buffel grass had some potential to improve soil structure in Alfisols in northern Australia. Apart from the formation of sowing furrows, soil in these treatments was not tilled.<br /><br />Sowing<br /><br />Pearl millet (cultivar 'BK 560' ) was sown in the tillage depth X mulch type factorial on 26 July 1988. Seeds were sown by hand in rows 60 cm apart. Small sowing furrows were formed by drawing the chisel tines at a depth of 5 cm in all tillage treatments. In T2o plots, the millet rows were located over the path of the deep tillage tines. Buffel grass and verano were sown in rows 38 cm apart. In mixed swards the species were sown in alternate rows. Perennial pigeonpea (cultivar 'ICPL 88040') was sown in rows 1 m apart, and plants within rows were 1.2 m apart. The seeds were covered with soil by hand-raking. Grass weeds were controlled by spraying with paraquat 1 week before the treatments were applied. Post-emergence weed control was by hand-sickle. A uniform millet stand was ensured by hand-thinning and transplanting 4 weeks after sowing. D i a m m o n i u m phosphate fertiliser ( 18% N, 20% P) was broadcast by hand at a rate of 120 kg ha- ~on all plots before sowing. Urea (46% N ) was broadcast on millet plots at the rate of 100 kg ha- 1on 5 September.<br /><br />Measurements<br /><br />Rainfall rate was measured at 1 min intervals with a Monitor Sensors tipping bucket (0.2 mm per tip) pluviometer connected to a Campbell CR10 logger. Plot runoff was channelled through a sediment collection trough and the flow rate was measured by a tipping bucket fitted with a magnet-operated reed switch monitored by the CR 10 logger. During rainfall the logger checked the reed switch circuits to each tipping bucket once per s. When the bucket was at rest the magnet was either against or away from the reed switch, i.e. the circuit was either open or closed. A change in state of a circuit was recorded as a bucket tip. One bucket tip was equivalent to approximately 0.05 mm of runoff from the plots. Each bucket was calibrated over a range of flow rates in the laboratory and again after installation in the field. Tipping bucket design and calibration was described by Smith and Thomas ( 1988 ).<br /><br />204 G.D. SMITHET AL.<br />Runoffbedload was collected in a trough 25 cm deep and 22 cm wide. Runoff flowed into the trough in a 50 cm section at either end and had to flow approximately 2 m to the outlet to the tipping bucket. After runoff events, most of the surplus water was drained from the trough. All of the deposited bed load was then collected through a drain plug and dried. Suspended load was sampled during the runoff event by a flow-splitting slot which sampled approximately 0.001 of the flow to the tipping bucket. Suspended load was subsampled, settled, dried and weighed and the concentration used to calculate the weight of suspended sediment. Soil water content and bulk density were measured at 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm depth in all plots in the week beginning 12 September. Soil samples for nutrient analysis were also taken. Millet yield was measured by cutting and threshing a strip 20 m by 2<br />m. Cenchrus and Stylosanthes plants were trimmed early in the growing sea-<br />son and were then allowed to go to seed to thicken the stand. Pigeonpea yield was measured by picking pods and trimming plants 80 cm above the ground.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Soil properties<br />There were no significant differences between treatments in pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium or sodium. However, rice straw mulch significantly increased potassium levels compared with no mulch (32 vs. 47 mg kg- ~), but only in the 0-15 cm layer. We have no explanation for this result; presumably it is associated with the breakdown of the rice straw. There was no significant difference between treatments in soil water content or bulk density at any depth. This lack of persistence of any tillage effect on bulk density agrees with the findings of Awadhwal and Smith (1990).<br />Pigeonpea yieM<br />Yields of pigeonpea cuttings and grain yield are presented in Table 1. Pigeonpea as a sole crop had significantly higher yield than either pigeonpea<br />with Stylosanthes or pigeonpea with Cenchrus and Stylosanthes. The lower<br />yield of pigeonpea when in combination with pasture species is attributed to competition for water and nutrients. The pigeonpea canopy was always above the understorey, hence competition for light was not a factor.<br />MilletyieM<br />Yields of millet straw and grain are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

Interactions between tillage depth and mulch were not significant. Millet straw and grain yields were significantly reduced by tillage to 20 cm compared with To and Tlo. This result is unexpected because previous work at the ICRISAT Centre had found that deeper tillage improved root penetration into the argillic ho-<br /><br />206 G.D. SMITH ET AL.<br />rizon. There is no obvious reason why deeper tillage should have reduced yield under the conditions of the 1988 season. A possible explanation is that deep tillage, because it was necessarily done after rain had softened the soil, may have caused smearing and compaction adjacent to the tine marks. However, runoff data (Table 4) show no evidence of a reduction in infiltration due to compaction. The lack of any effect on infiltration also suggests that leaching of nutrients beyond the root zone is unlikely to be a cause of the reduced yield. Deep tillage increased surface roughness, and a combination of increased surface ponding and slower internal drainage might have caused denitrification and hence reduced yield but, as stated above, analyses showed no differences in soil nitrogen. Perhaps the lack of a positive effect of tillage<br /><br />TABLE4<br /><br />Effects of tillage depth and mulch under millet, and of perennial species combinations on total runoff (mm and percent of rainfall (395.6 mm) )<br /><br />Treatment t<br />ToRmM2 TIoRmM T2oRmM T2oFmM T2oNmM ToFmM P TtoFmM P+S S TIoNmM ToNmM P+S+C C C+S<br /><br />Mean runoff (mm)<br />62.5 ~ 7 6 . 0 ~b 79.6 ~bc 101.6boa 111.9 ede 112.3 ode 120.3 de 121.2 def 122.1 def 125.5 dCf 131.7def 132.9 d*f 134.0 der 143.3 ¢f 154.8f<br /><br />% rainfall<br />15.8 19.2 20.1 25.7 28.3 28.4 30.4 30.6 30.9 31.7 33.3 33.6 33.9 36.2 39.1<br /><br />LSDo.o5<br /><br />33.92<br /><br />Main effects, factorially analysed as a sub-set (all interactions NS) To 102.6 Tto 109.6 T2o 96.5 Nm 124.2b Fm 111.7b Rm 72.7a<br /><br />LSDo.o5<br /><br />19.44<br /><br />~Treatments with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P-&lt; 0.05 ). 2Abbreviations: To, no tillage; T~o, tillage to 10 cm; T2o, tillage to 20 cm; Nm, no mulch; Rm, rice straw at 5 t ha-~; Fm, farmyard manure at 15 t ha-1; M, millet; P, pigeonpea; S, Stylosanthes hamata; C, Cenchrus ciliaris.<br /><br />RUNOFF AND EROSION REDUCTION ON A HARDSETTINGALFISOL<br /><br />207<br /><br />is because it was not carried out as several dry season operations but rather as one operation after the initial rains. Mulches had no effect on straw yield but FYM increased (P= 0.017) grain yield compared with Nm and Rm. This is attributed to improved nutrient availability rather than to any effect on soil physical properties.<br /><br />Runoff<br /><br />Rainfall between sowing and harvest of the pearl millet totalled 395.6 mm and EI3o (calculated as per Rosenthal and White, 1980) totalled 163 t m ha -~ h -~. Runoff occurred (at least in some plots) in nine rainfall events: Event A, 5 August 1988, rainfall 12 mm; Event B, 12 August 1988, 21.4 mm; Event C, 15 August 1988, 46 mm; Event D, 18 August 1988, 41.4 ram; Event E, 28 August 1988, 40.8 mm; Event F, 31 August 1988, 30.8 mm; Event G, 1 September 1988, 39.8 mm; Event H, 2 September 1988, 11.8 mm; and Event I, 20 September 1988, 8.8 mm. Mean total runoff (Table 4 ) ranged from 62.5 to 154.8 mm (15.8-39.1% of rainfall). From the ranking in Table 4, treatments with millet tended to have lower runoff. Possible explanations are that water use by the millet caused a higher soil water deficit when rain fell and that the canopy protected the soil surface from raindrop impact. Two treatments under millet (To Nm M and Tto Nm M) had relatively high runoffpossibly due to surface sealing before the canopy developed. Treatments with<br />rice straw mulch had relatively low runoff, whereas those with Cenchrushad<br />relatively high runoff. The relativelyhigh runoff from treatments that include<br />Cenchrus, is attributed to the tussock growth habit of this grass and to slow<br />developmentof ground cover and surface litter between the tussocks. Analysis of variance for the factorial sub-set (Table 4) shows that effects<br />of tillage depth were not significant, but for mulch, rice straw significantly (P&lt; 0.001 ) reduced runoff compared with FYM and no mulch. The lack of a significant tillage effect on runoff suggests that either the argillic horizon throttle was not altered by tillage operations, or that tillage has only a shortlived effect and a throttle re-forms at, or close to, the surface in this soil. The strong effect of rice straw in reducing runoff (compare To Rm M and T~o Rm M with To Nm M and Tlo Nm M in Table 4) is unlikely to be solely due to protection of the surface from raindrop impact. This is because the soil in all tillage treatments is at least partially protected from raindrop impact by the millet canopy. Rice straw could reduce runoffby: (i) reducing the rate of soil wetting and raindrop impact and hence reducing aggregate breakdown; (ii) slowingrunoffand increasing the time available for infiltration; (iii) increasing the proportion of the plot surface that is ponded, thereby exposing more permeable areas for infiltration; (iv) increasing the infiltrability of the soil by increasing the activity of soil burrowing fauna. Farmyard manure did not<br /><br />208 G.D. SMITH ET AL.<br />reduce runoff. This suggests that the effect of straw was not solely because it provided a food source for soil organisms.<br />These results suggest that treatments similar to traditional tillage-based farming practices do not maximise infiltration and minimise runoff. Shallow tillage might improve sowing conditions and control weeds, but cover in contact with the soil surface seems essential for maximum in situ water conservation.<br />Soil loss<br />Bed load was measured as the weight of sediment in the trough; suspended load was the weight of sediment in the water sampled by the flow splitter. The suspended load dataset for some events was incomplete because samples were lost due to insects, spiders or debris blocking the flow-splitting device, or due to leakage or accident. Consequently, total soil loss for the season was estimated by summing across events the product of runoff volume and average sediment concentration within each treatment. These estimates range from 0.7 to 3.8 t ha-1; they give an indication of the order of total soil loss for the season but, being based on average concentrations, they were not statistically analysed. A full dataset was available for Events C and F and the analysis of variance is summarised (Table 5 ) to show treatment effects on soil loss processes twice in the season. Event C was the first, and Event F the fourth event that caused runoff from all plots. The concentration of suspended load (Table 5) decreased considerably (about six-fold) between Events C and F, probably because of soil consolidation and an increase in the amount of protective plant cover. Bed load decreased about two-fold between Event C and Event F. The concentration of suspended load was higher than that of bed load in these events (often by an order of magnitude), indicating that erosion was mainly by raindrop detachment and suggesting that nutrient enrichment in sediments could be high.<br />For Event C (Table 5 ), there was no consistent pattern in the effect of the perennial species or the tillage and mulch treatments. This was the first major runoff event of the season and sediment detachment and delivery processes might not have stabilised. Also, treatments with relatively low runoff could have had relatively high sediment concentrations because the material available for erosion was not diluted by large flow volumes. The analysis of variance within the factorial sub-set (Table 5 ) shows that tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration, but had no effect on bed load. The effect on suspended load suggests that tillage reduced soil strength and made soil more easily entrained; the lack of effect on bed load suggests that surface roughness aided deposition.<br />For Event F (Table 5 ), the only consistent trend was for rice straw mulch treatments to have the lowest bed and suspended load concentrations.

This suggests that some FYM was washed off the plots but, considering the rate of application, relatively little was lost. Suspended load concentration was significantly reduced by rice straw mulch by comparison with Nm and Fm which suggests that raindrop impact was the main detachment mechanism and that the FYM did not protect the soil. The lack of significant tillage effects on suspended load concentration (in contrast to Event C) suggests that the tilled soil had consolidated.<br />The results for these events show that soil loss was mainly in the form of<br /><br />210 G.D. SMITHET AL.<br />suspended load. The small proportion of bed load may have been because active rills had not formed and soil was eroded mainly by rainfall detachment. Treatments appeared to reduce erosion by protecting the soil surface rather than by increasing soil strength. Neither the millet canopy nor the cover provided by the perennial species fully protected the soil from erosion. The treatment approximating traditional farmer practice (tillage to 10 cm with no mulch) had relatively high levels of soil loss. The results indicate a possible role of straw mulch in improving sustainability of cropping on these soils; it reduces the volume of runoff and the concentration of sediment in runoff. The lack of positive tillage effects suggests a limited role for tillage.<br />CONCLUSION<br />Practices that reduce runoffmake more water available for crop production and tend to reduce erosion. Cover in contact with the soil surface reduced runoff and sediment concentration even under a millet canopy. We think that the beneficial effects of contact cover arise from several mechanisms. These include protecting the soil surface from raindrop impact, delayingwater flow on the soil surface so that the depth of temporary pondage increases and opportunity for infiltration increases, and improving the habitat for macrofauna which create continuous, water conductingmacropores. Changes in soil structure due to biological processes are expected to be slow and some years might pass before treatment effects are fully expressed in this experiment. Conclusions drawn from the results during the establishment phase reported here are only tentative. We cannot yet properly evaluate the effect of the perennial species or of zero tillage treatments. Nevertheless, the comparison of traditional and alternative practices shows what can be expected in the initial phase if systems are changed. The results suggest that there may be advantages for soil and water conservation on hardsetting soils in the SAT from mulch-based, rather than tillage-based systems. There appear to be possibilities for developingmore productive and more sustainable systems. The challenge will be to develop systems that are economically viable and socially acceptable in the SAT.<br />ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br />This experiment was established as part of a collaborative project on soil and water conservation between ICRISAT and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries.

Perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.) was grown as a multipurpose tree species in strips or blocks with annual crops (sorghum, sunflower and chickpea) on a shallow Vertisol from 1987 to 1989. The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N).<br />Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better access to water. On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the shading by the taller pigeonpea. Measurements of root profile of pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved. The results are compared with other TCI studies especially with Leucaena leucocephala in the semi-arid crops and the possible mechanisms for moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed.<br />Introduction<br />Long duration genotypes of pigeonpea (Cajanus cafan (L) Millsp.) are tradi-<br />tionally grown in home gardens and field bunds to provide food, fodder and firewood but the use of pigeonpea as a perennial component in agroforestry systems is under-exploited. Susceptibility of pigeonpea to fusarium wilt, rhizoctonia stem rot and sterility mosaic diseases were often cited as the major constraints to developing perennial systems on a wide scale. The recent availability of genotypes with resistance to these diseases has stimulated research in developing agroforestry systems using the 'perennial' pigeonpea [21.<br />Several workers have postulated that the key to the development of compatible tree-crop combinations on agroforestry depends on an understanding of the interaction at the tree-crop interface [1, 41. If the net effect at<br />* Submitted as ICRISAT Journal Article No. 1176 for Agroforestry Systems.<br /><br />178<br />the tree-crop interface is advantageous or positive, planting arrangements which maximize the amount of interface would provide the greatest benefit. There is no particular advantage in modifying planting arrangements when the net effect of the tree-crop interface (TCI) is neutral. Finally, the interaction at the TCI may be negative as in the alley-cropping described for Leucaena leucocephala Lam and crop in semi-arid India [9] where it would be preferable to manage the tree and crops as separate stands.<br />Previous studies at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, India have demonstrated that the interaction at the TCI of perennial pigeonpea and crops like sorghum and chickpea is neutral with perennial pigeonpea as the dominant species [2]. A comparison of 1:2 proportion of pigeonpea: crop as block planting (one interface) or as strip-planting (7 interfaces) produced the same dry matter and grain yield at the end of the two-year study. However block planting favoured the yield of the crop while strip planting promoted the yield of the pigeonpea.<br />In this paper the growth, morphology, and utilization of water and light of pigeonpea at the TCI are compared with the plants in the middle of the block planting.<br />Materials and methods<br />Site<br />The experimental site was a shallow Vertisol (Typic pellustert) at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India (18°N 780E, 545 m above sea level). Top soil has a depth of 40-45 cm with a variable murum layer below. Long term average rainfall is 610 mm during the rainy season with 148 mm occurring during the postrainy season. In 1987, the total rainfall for the rainy season was 582 mm and 254 mm during the post-rainy season. In contrast 1988 was usually wet with 900 mm rainfall in the rainy-season but the post-rainy season was almost dry (7 mm in total).<br />Design and treatments<br />The experiment was designed to evaluate two planting arrangements: block and strip planting. In block planting, pigeonpea cv. ICP 8094 and annual crops were spatially separated with a single interacting surface (interface) between them. Strip planting consisted of four pigeonpea strips of 4.0 m alternated with annual crop strips of 8.0 m providing seven interfaces (Fig. 1). Spacing was common in both planting arrangements with pigeonpea at 1.0 m X 1.0 m and annual crops in 45 X 15 cm.

Furthermore, in strips, the maximum distance of a pigeonpea plant from the interface row was 1.0 m whereas it was 8.0 m in sole blocks. Therefore, growth observations were made at the interface, 3rd, 6th and 9th rows in the block, and at the interface and inner rows in the strip.<br />The whole area was fertilized with 100 kg ha -~ of diammonium phosphate, broadcast and incorporated at the beginning of each season. Sorghum and sunflower were top-dressed with 42 kg ha-1 three weeks after sowing.<br />Measurements<br />Plant height, stem diameter at 20 cm from ground level and number of branches were measured at fortnightly intervals from 22 weeks after sowing (WAS) onwards with ten plants per treatment in each replication.<br />Growth analysis of annual crops began in the post-rainy season in November 1987 with chickpea. Plants were harvested for growth analysis from 24 days after sowing (DAS) at fornightly intervals until maturity. At each harvest all above-ground materials were collected from two one-meter row lengths of each treatment at 0.5, 2.5 and 4.5 m distance from the interface. In 1988, an additional harvest was made at 1.5 m in both treatments. At maturity, four 8.0 m row lengths were harvested to estimate final grain and dry matter yield.<br />Pigeonpea was harvested at grain maturity in March 1988 and January 1989 by cutting the branches at 1.0 m above ground and the materials were separated into grain, stems and leaves for dry matter determination at 80 °C.<br />Light interception was measured between interface -- 1st row and 8th9th row in block planting of pigeonpea and in the middle of sole annual crop<br /><br />181<br />at positions illustrated in Fig. 1. Light interception was estimated with tube solarimeters (Delta-T, U.K) placed at ground level across three rows of annual crop and between two rows of pigeonpea in an east-west direction in all replications. One neutron probe access tube was installed at the interface B2, B3 and $1, $2 in each plot between rows to a depth of 1.2 m. Water content in the upper 30 cm of the profile was determined gravimetrically and below 30 cm, at 15 cm increments, with a neutron probe. The probe was calibrated against gravimetric measurements from a sample soil core adjacent to the access tubes installed in the border rows of the crop.<br />Root distribution and density were measured in five interface plants in strip planting towards pod maturity (January 1989) in the second year. Trenches were dug with a power digger to expose a soil profile of 2.0 m deep and 2.0 m long from the base of the pigeonpea plant. This surface was smoothened and washed with a hose fitted to a hydrant. An approximate pattern of root distribution was obtained by placing a grid of 10 cm squares against the exposed soil face and counting the number of root ends in each square [3]. Soil cores for root extraction were taken with a soil auger of 10 cm diameter at 10, 30, 50, 75, 125 and 175 cm from the base of the plant in the horizontal axis and at 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 50, 80, 120, 160 and 200 cm in the vertical axis. Thus, there were 42 soil cores for each plant. Roots were extracted by washing the core samples in a Gillison's hydropneumatic root washer, blotting off excess moisture and separating manually any remaining debris. Root length was estimated with a modified Delta-T area meter, and the root density was expressed as cm root cm-3 of soil.<br />Results<br />Shoot growthofpigeonpea<br />The effect of distance from interface on growth of pigeonpea is presented in Table 2. Because the growth of pigeonpea was similar at the interface rows (I) of blocks and strips, the values were combined. Similarly the values for the middle of the strip and third row of the block treatment were combined. The ninth row (N) in the block treatment was the least productive in the first year but by the second year there was no significant difference between the third, sixth and ninth rows in terms of grain yield. In the first year, the N plants were taller than the I plants because the chickpea plants were short (30 cm) and did not compete strongly against the I pigeonpea whereas there was considerable mutual shading in the N row. At the end of the second year, differences between the I and N plants had widened in grain yield from 1.48 to 3.46 times and in stem diameter from 1.16 to 1.43 times.<br />Differences in the height and stem diameter between I and N plants were evident but not statistically significant from 22 to 52 WAS (Fig. 2a and 2b).

Increase in height and diameter of I plants continued from 75 to 80 WAS whereas N plants showed a decline in growth from 65 WAS onwards.<br />The number of primary branches reached a maximum at about 26 WAS and remained unchanged in the I plants (Fig. 3). There was dieback of branches in the N plants resulting in a decrease in primary branch number and consequently a significant difference between treatments was evident at 29 and 33 WAS. Number of flowering branches in both treatments increased curvi-linearly and after 31 WAS, the I plants had significantly more flowering branches than N plants.

N u m b e r of total and flowering branches in the interface and middle of the stand<br />during the first cycle of growth.<br /><br />184<br />was only influenced after 80 DAS (Fig. 4a). At maturity chickpea growth at 0.5 m was reduced to 21% compared to the chickpea at 4.5 m. In the following rainy season sunflower growth at 0.5 m was also greatly reduced (to 48%) but there was no difference in growth at 1.5 m and 2.5 m distance away from the interface (Fig. 4b). Shading by the dense canopy of the I pigeonpea may account for the reduction in sunflower growth and the effect was observed as early as 40 DAS. The most drastic reduction in annual crop was evident in the post-rainy season when chickpea growth was reduced to 8% of sole crop at 0.5 m and extending to 2.5 m away from the interface. (Fig. 4b).<br />Root growth and moisture utilization<br />Lateral roots of pigeonpea had extended into the annual crop area in the strip planting treatment and into the fallow area of the block treatment. Since there was no difference in root distribution of pigeonpea between cropped and fallow areas, it was assumed that the roots of chickpea, harvested about a month earlier, did not have a significant influence on the root counts.<br />Root ends were seen in the entire 2.0 X 2.0 m soil profile (Fig. 5). However, the major concentration of roots, denoted by more than 10 root ends 100 cm-2, was to a depth of 1.3 m and a distance of 1.0 m away from the base of the plant. Roots of more than 2.0 mm diameter were mostly confined to the upper 0.5 m and to a distance of 1.2 m laterally. Nevertheless, occasionally roots of more than 5.0 mm diameter penetrated deeper than 1.5 m (data not presented).<br />Root density was highest in the upper 15 cm soil layer and decreased with increasing depth (Fig. 6). The surface soil layer contained more than 1.0 cm of root -3 of soil up to a horizontal distance of 1.25 m, beyond which there was a sharp decline in root density. Similarly, the decline in root density with increasing depth from 7.5 cm to 22.5 cm was very marked. Almost 36% of total root density in the 2.0 x 2.0 m area investigated was in the upper most 15 cm of soil.<br />Moisture depletion by perennial pigeonpea in the interface was studied in the post-rainy seasons of 1987 and 1988. Although the drying cycle commenced in late-November in the first year (1987) and in early-October in the second year (1988), the plants were almost at the same phenological stage of onset of flowering in both years. Moisture depletion was monitored over a period of six weeks in both years. This period extended from the onset of flowering to early pod filling stage.<br />Moisture depletion in the first year was highest at a depth of 30 cm and 45 cm of the interface plant and was relatively less in the deeper layers (Fig. 7a and 7b). In the second year however, depletion was generally high in all the layers and it was obvious that the access tubes were not sufficiently deep for an accurate measurement of the total water uptake by pigeonpea.

Throughout the season there was no apparent difference in the shading at the TCI between the block and strip treatments i.e. in positions B&gt; $2 or $4 in Fig. 1. From September to October, when the sunflower crop was removed, and before the emergence of the post-rainy chickpea, shading at the TCI ranged from 50 to 53 + 4% (Fig. 8). Therefore perennial pigeonpea shading at the TCI was largely confined to 1.0 m distance from the last row being consistent with the growth data during the season.<br />The seasonal trend in the fractional light interception (f) of sole perennial pigeonpea (B4), annual crops (B1) and strip stands are illustrated in Fig. 9.<br /><br />0 Distance from base of the plant (m) 0<br />e~3<br /><br />187<br />2.0<br />• &gt;30<br />• 20-30 ]10-20 [ ] 5-10<br /><br />2.0<br />Fig,. 6. Root density of perennial pigeonpea in the interface towards the end of second cycle.<br />The total interception of the strip treatment is the average f measured at positions S~ to S~. In early July, interception by sole perennial pigeonpea already reached 45% whereas interception by sole sunflower was only 10% and that of strip treatment was 35%. By early August all crops had intercepted 90% of the radiation but heavy rains later in the month resulted in complete mortality of the sunflower crop which was removed in September. Growth of perennial pigeonpea was not adversely affected by the heavy rain and light interception was maintained at about 80% until leaf senescence in December, falling to 50% by mid January. In contrast, growth of chickpea was slow and f was consistently lower than that of perennial pigeonpea. Interception by strip treatment was intermediate between f of sole perennial pigeonpea and annual crops from August to January. During the dry season regrowth of pigeonpea was slow and reached only a maximum f of 30% in May.<br />Light interception by the annual crop in the middle of the perennial pigeonpea strips ($3) was similar to that of sole crop (BI) in the rainy season but in the post-rainy season f at S3 was 13% greater than in sole chickpea at maturity. These results are not consistent with the growth data which showed that the dry matter was less at S3 than at B 1. During the post-rainy season the reduction in chickpea yield at the TCI extended well beyond (2.5 m) the shade (&lt; 1 m) of the perennial pigeonpea, suggesting that the yield reduction<br /><br />188<br /><br />a) Volumetric water content (cnl3 cn~3) 0 O.OS 0.1 0.1S 0.2 0,25 0.3<br />0 ii) ii<br /><br />b) Volumetric water content (cm3 c ~ 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3<br />r ~i i i i<br /><br />30<br />E<br />(,)<br />60 aG)<br />90<br /><br />120<br />Fig. 7.

Therefore, perennial pigeonpea plants at the TCI had significantly more branches and bigger stems than plants in the middle of the stands at the onset of the following rainy season i.e. at 52 WAS. However, significant differences in the number of flowering branches at the I and N plants occurred earlier at 26 WAS. Measurements of solar radiation indicated that intense shading (8090%) had occurred at floral initiation of perennial pigeonpea and lower branches of N plants did not produce any flowers. Artificial shading of annual pigeonpea has shown that abortion of flowers occurs at low irradiance<br /><br />189<br />100<br /><br />80<br />v<br />60<br />PoJ<br />~ 4o<br /><br />Interface<br /><br />20<br /><br />IIII Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov<br />1988<br /><br />rIfII]<br /><br />Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun<br /><br />Date<br /><br />1989<br /><br />Fig. 8. Light interception of perennial pigeonpea, sole crops and at interface from July 1988 to January 1989.

In contrast, pigeonpea plants at the TCI were exposed to full light on one side when the rainy season annual crops were harvested at 13 WAS in the first year and at 65 WAS in the second year.<br />The benefit of the interface effect on the perennial pigeonpea growth appeared to be confined to the first row only, probably because the plants were already fairly widely spaced at 1 m apart, and partly because of the intense shading by the outermost perennial pigeonpea row. Although it was not possible to separate the benefit at the interface due to below ground interactions, the extensive lateral root distribution suggests that access to water and nutrients was significantly greater at the TCI. The neutron moisture techniques used in this study was unsatisfactory for quantifying the water uptake at the TCI because access tubes could not be installed to adequate depth and there was insufficient number of tubes across the TCI. Thus it is not possible to make firm conclusions about the water uptake by the pigeonpea plants. A more appropriate approach is the sap-flow technique described by Ong et al. [7] which is relatively simple to use and furthermore is non-destructive.<br /><br />190<br />100<br />g<br />t-<br />o 60<br />¢1.<br />CPO<br />C<br />40<br />.J<br />20<br /><br />Block Strip<br />4<br /><br />0I<br /><br />III III[II<br /><br />Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun<br /><br />1988<br /><br />Date<br /><br />1989<br /><br />Fig. 9. Comparison of light interception of block and strip plantings.<br /><br />The negative effect of the TCI on the growth and yield of annual crops was greatest during the post-rainy season. For example, during the rainy season the reduction in growth of sunflower extended to 1.5 m compared to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season. In both seasons the negative effect on crops became apparent at 30-40 days after the sowing of the annual crops. During the rainy season the negative effect was probably caused by shading by the taller pigeonpea since rainfall was close to the evaporative demand but shading extended to 1 m into the sunflower stand. In both post-rainy seasons the reduction in the chickpea growth extended beyond the distance of the lateral roots of the perennial pigeonpea (1.75 m). However it is possible that some roots of perennial pigeonpea might have decomposed when root sampling was made. Since shading by pigeonpea extended to 2.5 m of chickpea stand, competition for moisture most probably was a major cause for the negative effect on chickpea growth. Results from an unrelated experiment in an adjacent field strongly indicate that other factors might also be involved. The unpublished evidence showed that annual pigeonpea has a strongly negative residual effect on a post-rainy chickpea and this 'allelopathic' effect cannot be removed by application of carbofuron. Firm evidence of the competition for moisture between trees and annual crops have been<br /><br />191<br />reported in alley cropping systems based on Leucaena leucocephala using<br />root barriers [9]. Such techniques would be useful to examine this kind of below ground interactions.<br />In the study of Singh et al. [9[ the growth and yield of annual crops (sorghum, cowpea and castor bean) during the rainy season in an Alfisol<br />were reduced to a distance of 3 m from a single row of L. leucocephala. In another L. leucocephala study of the TCI on Alfisols Rao et al. [8] reported<br />that the yield of sunflower was reduced to a distance of 3.6 m from a paired-<br />row of L. leucocephala. In comparison, in the present study the negative<br />effect of perennial pigeonpea on the growth of sunflower was confined to a distance of 1.5 m. Although these observations suggest that perennial<br />pigeonpea is less competitive than L. leucocephala, the influence of rainfall,<br />soil types and density of trees cannot be distinguished in the above reports. Recently attempts have been made at ICRISAT Center to compare the inter-<br />face effects of both tree species on maize but serious psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) on L. leucocephala var. K 8 has confounded interpretation of the<br />results obtained. Nevertheless, the unpublished data confirmed that maize<br />yield was less reduced (6%) by perennial pigeonpea than by L. leucocephala<br />(28%). The present study shows that the TCI is the basic unit for tree-crop<br />interaction as proposed by Huxley [4]. While the interface effect was extended well into the annual crops in the present study the benefit to the tree was restricted to the outermost row consistent with other observations [5]. In their detailed study of TCI in a semi-arid site in Kenya with a bimodal rainfall regime, Huxley et al. [5] also reported changes in soil moisture at various distances from the trees and they suggested that the drier soil profile near the trees were due to a combination of uptake by roots of trees and the interception of rain by the tree canopy. In an analysis of the microclimatic interactions in agroforestry systems, Monteith et al. [6] suggested that interception of water by the tree component in an alley cropping system may divert enough water (20% of incident rainfall) from the annual component to<br />reduce its production. Thus, trees like Faidherbia albida (formerly Acacia albida), which sheds its leaves during the onset of the rainy season and is<br />used in traditional agroforestry systems in the semi-arid tropics, avoid the negative interactions for water both at the canopy level (by less rainfall interception) and at the subterranean level (by roots). Similarly, the slow initial growth rate of perennial pigeonpea is an important trait for intercropping with annual crop [2]. Therefore, Ong et al. [71 argued that the use of a tree species or management regime which encourages slow regrowth is desirable for a positive response at the tree-crop interface. In the present study perennial pigeonpea was cut once (in March) during the dry season for fodder but a further cut is possible before the sowing of the rainy season annual crops [2]. Recently, studies showed that perennial pigeonpea is less competitive to annual crops when cutting is done just before sowing of the annual crop.<br /><br /><br /></p>","/Users/kanedan29/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ukmuidcw.default/zotero/storage/USX7HH3K/Daniel et al_1991_Growth and resource utilization of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.pdf","","ALL((""long duration"" OR ""long-duration"" OR perennial) W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon pea"" OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Cajanus cajan; Chickpea; full text added; Perennial pigeonpea; Pigeonpea; relevant; resource utilization; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; Semi-arid tropics; SPV; Sunflower; tree-crop interface; TS=((""long duration"" OR perennial) NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perennial pigeonpea is receiving considerable attention in India as a multi-purpose species for agroforestry systems. Its multiple uses include food, fodder, manure and firewood. Data on perennial pigeonpea, together with relevant information on shorter-duration genotypes, are reviewed in this paper.<br />Growth of perennial pigeonpea, like that of medium-duration grain types (150 to 190 days) in intercropping systems with cereals, is slow during the first 3 to 4 months. Therefore, it requires minimum sacrifice in terms of yield of annual crops in the system during the first year and offers many of the benefits of tree species in subsequent years.

Susceptibility of pigeonpea to diseases and negative effects on growth of annual crops are the potential constraints in the semi-arid tropics. Some pertinent areas for further research are proposed.<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />A major constraint to the adoption of agroforestry systems in the semi-arid tropics is the severe competition between trees and crops for environmental resources. Mean grain yield reductions of more than 60% in annual crops have been reported in leucaena-based alley cropping systems [29]. In addition, tree species including leucaena are notoriously slow in giving economic returns because of poor growth rate during the year of planting. In contrast, in-<br />tercropping studies have consistently shown that pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan<br />(L.) Millsp.) tolerates severe shading and offers minimal competition to fastgrowing crops, but is able to recover from and compensate for the slow early growth [35]. Pigeonpea was a promising crop during the early part of this century in Hawaii and was sometimes managed as a perennial crop for grain and<br /><br />* Submitted as ICRISAT Journal Article No. 917 for 'Agroforestry Systems'.<br /><br />114<br />forage [16]. Though intrinsically perennial [5], pigeonpea is grown as a perennial crop (that is, more than 12 months) only in backyards, around annual crops, on field bunds, or as boundary plants [3, 15, 27]. Despite the potential to produce food, fodder and firewood, the use ofpigeonpea as the perennial component in agroforestry systems is under-exploited.<br />Perennial pigeonpea is similar to the medium-duration types (5 to 7 months) except for the longer duration to flowering and maturity, lower harvest index, greater ratoonability and deeper rooting habit. The perennial nature enables it to withstand harsh environmental conditions and recover after the removal of stresses. It is an attractive choice for smallholders because an edible grain yield is not commonly obtained from agroforestry species.<br />The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Hyderabad, India has the global germplasm collection for pigeonpea and suitable perennial genotypes have been identified for agroforestry uses. This paper reports on the results of preliminary trials started in 1985 with these materials and reviews the relevant information with the objective to stimulate interest in research on perennial pigeonpea as an agroforestry species. Due to the limited information available on perennial pigeonpea in agroforestry systems, data from genotypes grown mainly for grain, irrespective of growth duration, are often cited in this review.<br />2. Species characteristics<br />2.1 Environmental requirements<br />Pigeonpea is adapted to tropical and sub-tropical environments extending between 30 °N and 30 °S latitudes [28]. India, eastern Africa, central and south America and the Caribbean are major pigeonpea-producing regions. Bulk of the grain pigeonpea is grown in annual cropping systems of about seven months duration, most frequently as an intercrop with cereals. Pigeonpea has the hardiness to produce at least some grain yield under adverse conditions and make use of the residual moisture very efficiently [35]. Moreover, it grows satisfactorily even under the combined stress of drought and poor soil fertility [13].<br />Pigeonpea is grown in a wide range of agro-ecological situations and the cropping season for annual grain types normally avoids long drought and frost incidence. Since this is not possible in a perennial system, pigeonpeabased agroforestry systems cannot be adopted under certain environments. Areas prone to frost incidence and water logging are not suitable for<br /><br />115<br />t)~'. I. Six-month old perennial pigeonpea (right) and leucaena on Alfisol, ICRISAT Center.<br />pigeonpea [16, 33]. The soil must have high water holding capacity to enable perennial pigeonpea to withstand the dry season. Timeliness of major events - especially planting, fodder harvests and pod harvests - is essential to match the environmental requirement of pigeonpea with seasonal changes in relation to temperature and photoperiod. 2.2 Growth and yield potential Information on dry matter production and distribution vary widely probably due to the differences in genotype, environment and management. Initial growth and canopy development of perennial pigeonpea is so slow that light interception at 30 days after sowing was less than 10%, and was only about 50% at 60 days [C.K. Ong, unpublished]. This is similar to the values reported for medium-duration genotypes where the lag phase of pigeonpea is taken advantage of in many cropping systems to include faster growing crops like sorghum [35]. In spite of the slow canopy establishment, growth of pigeonpea was greater than leucaena in the first year in studies at ICRISAT (Fig. 1) and at IITA [11].<br />Total above-ground dry matter production was more than 15 t ha l in several early-maturing pigeonpea genotypes at Hisar in northern India [10]. The yield of rainfed perennial pigeonpea exceeds that of the most productive sorghum/pigeonpea intercropping system which varied from 8.0 to 10 t ha--<br /><br />116<br />at ICRISAT center (Piara Singh, unpublished). Harvest index of traditional grain pigeonpea varieties is below 20% and consequently the grain yield is only about 0.7 t ha -~. Allocation of assimilate towards grain is lower in perennial genotypes compared to annual types [21]. Nevertheless, several perennial pigeonpea genotypes with grain yield potentials of more than 2.0 t ha-1 have been identified at ICRISAT [9].<br />2.3 Genetic variation<br />The genotype range of pigeonpea extends from long duration to extra-short duration types that mature within 90 days [9]. Long-duration genotypes require about seven months for their first grain harvest, and repeat the growth cycle annually for several years. Thus, pigeonpea is a versatile plant that can be utilized, depending upon genotype and management, as a short-season annual in monocropping systems, as a residual-moisture utilizer in intercropping systems with cereals, or as a perennial in agroforestry systems.<br />Availability of genotypes of appropriate phenology and morphology for the perennial system is a basic requirement. Perennial pigeonpea in an agroforestry system would be subjected to one or more dry periods. Therefore, it should be able to withstand high temperature, low moisture availability, and incidence of pests and diseases, especially fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease. Several genotypes showing resistance to these stresses are being evaluated presently at ICRISAT center. Plant mortality in genotype ICP 8094 was 12% and 44%, respectively, at the end of first and second year. If the plant population is reduced during the second year, either due to plant mortality or as a management strategy, the branches of surviving plants should spread out to compensate for the lower population. A comparison of six perennial pigeonpea genotypes at ICRISAT [9] showed that the genotype ICP 8094 yielded more grain than others because of its bushy, spreading habit. However, preliminary observations from alley cropping trials at the same location showed that erect types are considerably less competitive than ICP 8094, probably due to their deep-rooting habit. Studies in Hawaii showed that erect-branching genotypes of pigeonpea produced deep-penetrating roots whereas roots of spreading types were dense and shallow [16]. An erect or semi-spreading type may be preferred for systems where light is a limiting factor for the annual crop.<br />2.4 Diseases and pests<br />Susceptibility to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease limited the utilization of pigeonpea as a perennial species. Plant mortality of about 75% due<br /><br />117<br />to fusarium wilt was observed after the second year in Malawi (S.A. Materechera, unpublished). Prospects for pigeonpea-based agroforestry systems have recently brightened with the advent of genotypes that combine resistances to these diseases. Diseases of minor importance can become more serious when the plant becomes less vigorous because of ageing. New diseases such as macrophomina blight can also become more important. Older wood and decaying roots may attract disease and pest problems as well.<br />The major pest in pigeonpea is the pod borer Helicoverpaarmigera. This pest can cause substantial reduction in grain yield as the affected pods can at times exceed 80% [8]. The height and the dense canopy of perennial pigeonpea poses a problem in pesticide spraying. In addition, the presence of another host in the system, such as chickpea, can further complicate the pest management strategy, although this has not yet been a problem at ICRISAT.<br />3. Uses in agroforestry systems<br />3.1 General<br />Uses for almost all the parts of pigeonpea are cited in literature. Hence, any economic evaluation of perennial pigeonpea-based systems must consider the total yield by way of grain, leaf and stem. In addition, yield improvement in the subsequent crop resulting from enhanced soil fertility can not be ignored. Uses of different products obtained from pigeonpea are reviewed in detail by Wallis et al. [33]. Some of the essential aspects are given below.<br />3.2 Seed and pod<br />Perennial pigeonpea seeds have essentially the same seed quality as grain types. The dry split pea is the principal use of pigeonpea. Protein content of dry seeds is in the 20 to 30% range [10, 34] which makes it an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet in India. Pigeonpea flour can be a substitute for mung bean flour in bean noodle in Thailand [3]. Immature green seeds of pigeonpea can have the same uses as green peas (Pisum sativum) in east Africa, the Caribbean and some parts of India. For this purpose, pigeonpea varieties with large, sweet seeds are preferred [8]. Pods of vegetable pigeonpeas have to be long, sweet, green and contain about six seeds.<br />Although pigeonpea is mainly grown as a human food, seeds can also be<br /><br />118<br />used as animal feed [33]. Harvest trash, consisting of pod walls, leaf and stem residue, was of higher feeding value than pod alone [34].<br />3.3 Leaf and stem<br />Pigeonpea leaves can be used as fodder for farm animals [33]. Fodder yields in the range 3.5 to 6.0tha -~ have been obtained with 3 to 4 cuts at 25 and 50cm heights. The in vitro digestibility of the foliage was between 41 and 69% and crude protein content was between 17 to 32% [2]. Preliminary studies on some promising perennial pigeonpea lines show that with irrigation they can produce 10 to 15 t ha- 1year 1of green fodder in three harvests [9, 33]. Pigeonpea fodder is usually available during the rainy season when fodder from other sources is plentiful. However, pigeonpea fodder, which has about 3.5% nitrogen [12], can be mixed with low quality fodder to improve the feeding value. Leaves can also be used as a mulch or green manure [6].<br />Stems of pigeonpea are an important by-product at the time of harvesting. The air-dried stem yield from long-duration genotypes was about 7.5 t ha 1season ~at Gwalior, India [9]. The air-dry stem weight, excluding the main stem up to a height of 1.0 m, obtained from perennial pigeonpea at ICRISAT center in the second year was 7.0 t ha- ~; the weight of the main stem was 2.0 t ha -~ . Total stem weights of 10 to 12 t ha -~ have been recorded in Malawi (S.A. Materechera, unpublished). In some areas of Northern India, wages for harvesting, threshing and bagging of pigeonpea is paid in the form of dried, threshed stems [14]. The main stem of pigeonpea is used as firewood and thin straight branches for thatching and basket making.<br />3.4 Soil fertility improvement<br />Perennial legume species are known for their potential to improve soil fertility through more efficient nutrient cycling and nitrogen fixation [19]. Being a deep-rooted plant, perennial pigeonpea can be expected to extract nutrients from deeper layers of soil and return to the surface layer through litter fall (Fig. 2). The nitrogen content of the pigeonpea leaf litter is about 1.3 to 1.5% [17] and a ton of fallen litter can contribute at least 10kg of nitrogen. In perennial systems, litter will be available yearly and, if left in situ, only a fraction of the nutrients released through decomposition is likely to get into the soil. Therefore, full benefits are realized only if the litter is incorporated into the soil and sufficient time is allowed for the release of nutrients through decomposition. Litter can also be collected from pigeonpea area and added to other crop fields either as a mulch or incorporated as a crop residue.<br /><br />119<br />Fig. 2. Litter-fall in recentlypruned (to 1.0m) perennial pigeonpeafieldat ICRISAT center. The amount of litter added by pigeonpea will depend on the genotype and<br />management practices. Litter from short and medium-duration pigeopea genotypes was less than 1.0 t ha- 1[8]. Litter yield can be substantially higher in long-duration pigeonpea. A four-year pigeonpea fallow at IITA yielded 12.8tha -I of air-dry matter excluding woody parts [12]. The quantity of litter will also depend on time of planting as it determines the vegetative phase of long-duration pigeonpea, a photosensitive genotype. A long-duration pigeonpea sown in June had a litter fall of 6.4 kg ha- ~whereas the same genotype sown in September had only 2.4 kg ha ~in north India [25]. Litter yield from perennial pigeonpea in the second year was about 3.0 t ha-~ at ICRISAT center.<br />Biological nitrogen fixation is another benefit from pigeonpea. An<br /><br />120<br />increase in nitrogen fixation with crop duration has been reported [17]. A pigeonpea genotype maturing in 115 days fixed only 4.4 kg nitrogen ha-l whereas a genotype reaching maturity in 215 days fixed almost 70 kg ha -~ . A large fraction of the fixed nitrogen is returned to the soil through litter, roots and nodules.<br />Fertility of soils where pigeonpea was grown is usually improved and this is reflected in the higher yields obtained from succeeding crops. The estimated residual nitrogen equivalent of a medium-duration pigeonpea ranged from 38 to 49 kg ha- 1which resulted in 57 and 32% increases in grain and dry matter yields respectively in the succeeding maize crop [18]. Residual effects are likely to be greater in soils cropped to perennial pigeonpea for a longer period.<br />Grown as a green manure crop in root-knot infested areas, pigeonpea reduced the level of nematodes in the succeeding susceptible crops. However, there was no reduction in the level of sting nematodes [24]. Though evidence is not available, perennial pigeonpea would be expected to improve many soil physical and chemical fertility parameters as well.<br />4. Management aspects<br />4.1 Spatial arrangement and plant density<br />The interaction between the perennial species and the annual crops in agroforestry systems would reach a maximum in mixed plantings and would be minimum when they are separated spatially by planting in sole blocks. Plant arrangements that reduce competition between the two components, by reducing the area of interaction, often increase competition for resources among plants of the perennial species. As a result, growth and biomass accumulation of the perennial in block-planting is likely to be lower compared to that in mixed planting. Systems such as alley cropping with single or double-row hedges and strip-cropping are between the extremes of mixed and block plantings. Such arrangements would favour grain production in pigeonpea as flowers and pods are borne on branches exposed to sunlight.<br />A study at ICRISAT center on a shallow Vertisol with perennial pigeonpea genotype ICP 8094 showed that the number of flowering branches and number of pods in a plant in the middle of the stand were only 42% and 30% respectively of that of a hedgerow plant in the second year (Table 1). As a result, grain yield was substantially higher for the hedgerow plant compared to the one in the middle of the stand. Seeds per pod and seed weight vary relatively little within a genotype, so number of branches and pods per unit<br /><br />121<br /><br />Table 1.

Plants in the middle of the stand tended to be taller than those in the hedgerow probably due to competition for light, but the stems of the hedgerow plants were significantly thicker in the second year (Table 1). As a result, the hedgerow plants yielded more stems than those in middle rows.<br />Alley cropping, though a promising system for the humid tropics, has limitations in the semi-arid tropics where moisture deficit is a major constraint [29]. Modifications in alley arrangement, such as increasing the alley width, may reduce the annual crop area facing competition from the hedgerow and increase the benefits from the system. However, this may result in the reduction in number, and thereby yield, of perennials per unit area. Studies at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) indicated that leaf and nitrogen yields of pigeonpea, leucaena and tephrosia decreased by about 65% when alley widths were increased from 2.25 to 6.75m [11]. Combining the perennial hedgerows to form strips, that is, increasing hedge width, will increase the alley width without a corresponding reduction in the number of perennial plants per unit area.<br />A comparison of block-planting of perennial pigeonpea with strip-planting - strips of 4.0 m width alternating with 8.0 m wide strips for annual crops<br />is being investigated at ICRISAT presently on a shallow Vertisol with<br />-<br />genotype 1CP 8094 (Fig. 3). Density in both planting arrangements is 10,000 plants ha -1. Results of this study show that dry matter production from the area under perennial pigeonpea (0.33ha as per the 1:2 perennial:annual arrangement) was 5.10 t in block-planting which is equivalent to 15.3tha -~ (Table 2). The equivalent grain yield from block-planting was<br /><br />122<br /><br />Fig. 3.

Dry matter and grain production of pigeonpea were significantly higher in strips than in blocks.<br />Annual crop yields in the study, however, were lower in strip-planting compared to block-planting because of growth retardation adjacent to pigeonpea rows. Growth retardation was negligible beyond 1.5 m from the base of the pigeonpea plants in the first year and the following rainy season, but was considerably greater in the second postrainy season (Fig. 4). Total production was not significantly different between the planting arrangements as the reduction in dry matter and grain yield in annual crops in strip-planting was compensated for by increased yield of pigeonpea. Although separation of the annual and the perennial species may not be important in terms of yield, it may be beneficial in plant management such as spraying or protection from off-season grazing. Competition in the strips can be reduced by removal of the lower branches of pigeonpea or harvesting for fodder at critical growth stages of the annual crop to reduce competition for light and moisture. If pruning is not possible, it would not be advisable to grow a post-rainy season crop. This should not be a problem where only a single crop is possible as in the case of a shallow or light soil.<br />Studies at ICRISAT on both Vertisol and Alfisol indicated that perennial pigeonpea behaves like medium duration types in the first year (Table 3), and was probably less competitive to the annual in the system than leucaena.<br /><br />124<br /><br />Table 3.

A population of 27,000 plants ha-l of medium-duration pigeonpea was considered optimum for intercropping with sorghum in order to minimize reduction in sorghum yield [30]. Subsequent studies showed that the pigeonpea population of the medium-duration genotype ICP 1 can be increased up to 60,000 plants ha-~ without a corresponding decrease in sorghum yields [23]. The optimum population of perennial pigeonpea for agroforestry systems is probably lower than for medium-duration types in intercropping systems. If the survival rate after the first year is good, some thinning can be effected as most perennials increase in size during the second year. Thinning by removal of alternate rows or two out of every three rows in medium-duration genotype ICP 1-6 planted at 300,000 plants ha -~ did not result in significant reductions in grain yield or litter fall [5].<br />As discussed already, pod-bearing in pigeonpea occurs mostly in terminal branches exposed to direct sunlight. The number of barren branches is likely to be greater at higher plant densities. However, the decline in productive branches can be more than compensated for by the increase in plant population. In a comparative study at ICRISAT, most of the perennial genotypes produced more grain and fodder when planted at 330,000 plants ha-' than<br /><br />125<br />at 28,000 plants ha-i [9]. Grain yield was unaffected by density in the range of 15,000 to 95,000 plants ha-1 in another study comparing four perennial genotypes at ICRISAT, but surprisingly firewood production decreased with increasing plant population because of the reduction in stem diameter [9].<br />4.2 Production systems<br />Traditionally pigeonpea is sown in June-July in grain-production systems in India [4]. This enables the crop to utilize the monsoonal rains for vegetative growth and the short days that follow for flower induction. After the harvest of the main crop, one or two ratoon crops are taken provided winter is mild and moisture is not limiting. In another system, pigeonpea is sown about two months after the longest day, that is, September-October in the northern hemisphere and March-April in southern hemisphere. Such a system is practised in some parts of peninsular India where cropping is done in Vertisols only during the post-rainy season [20]. In this system, pigeonpea is planted in late-September or early-October, grain is harvested in March, and the crop is ratooned. The profuse vegetative growth resulting from the June rains may be harvested as fodder, and a grain yield obtained from the fresh growth in November. A second ratoon is possible if conditions are favourable. A similar system has been studied with a medium-duration genotype ICP 1-6 [5]. Grain yield in this system was low in the first harvest because of late planting and the third harvest was also small. Therefore, more than 65% of the total grain yield was obtained from the second harvest.<br />Perennial pigeonpea-based agroforestry systems can be similar to the above situations. In a study at ICRISAT, perennial pigeonpea was sown in August, a grain yield was obtained in January of the following year, and subsequently three fodder harvests were taken in April, May and July [9]. This cycle can be repeated in the following year. Grain and dry matter production may probably be lower during the first year if planted late, especially at higher latitudes. Sowing after mid-September caused sharp decline in grain yields of long-duration pigeonpea genotypes in north India [25]. Byth et al. [1981] described a grain-production system where photoperiod-insensitive genotypes are sown as soon as soil temperatures are favourable for germination after winter [4]. This system is practised in north India with pigeonpea grown as a sole crop or intercropped with mungbean. The favourable time for planting in this system is during March-April in the northern hemisphere and September-October in southern hemisphere. Perennial pigeonpea can fit into such early plantings as well, provided<br /><br />126<br />moisture is not a limiting factor. However, flowering may not occur for several months because perennial genotypes are unlikely to be photo-insensitive. A management strategy for this system would be to harvest for fodder until the onset of short days.<br />4.3 Harvesting<br />Timing and method of fodder and grain harvests should be such that future yields are not affected. Fodder harvests should be done when there is a dry spell during the rainy season. If the field is excessively wet at the time of fodder harvest, the plants can be killed by waterlogging. Multiple fodder cuts are possible when a grain yield is not the objective. Fodder harvest towards shorter days can result in either low or no grain yield because of insufficient vegetative growth when daylength is favourable for flower induction. Different cutting intervals [26] and cutting heights [2] have been investigated and generally 3-4 cuts and cutting heights of 25-50 cm have been most productive.<br />Pods can be hand picked or removed with stems, and the plants pruned back to a suitable height after harvest. Hand picking resulted in earlier flowering and greater number of pods in the second flush than harvesting by cutting branches in a short-duration (4 months) pigeonpea [22]. The lower the pruning height, the smaller were the second harvest yields of a mediumduration pigeonpea [32]. Tayo [1985], however, reported that ratooning at 30 cm in a dwarf pigeonpea resulted in higher yields than hand picking or ratooning at 60cm [31]. Information on appropriate cutting heights for fodder and grain harvest in perennial pigeonpea is lacking.<br />5. Research needs<br />Information presently available, though limited, establish perennial pigeonpea as a promising species for agroforestry systems. More research is needed on several agronomic aspects and some pertinent areas are listed below. 1. Appropriate canopy management practices and optimum population to<br />minimize competition for moisture, nutrients and light encountered by the annual crops in the system. 2. Productive life of perennial pigeonpea, ratoonability, pruning strategies, pest and disease management. 3. Effectiveness of pigeonpea foliage as a green manure during the rainy season when the demand for fodder is low. 4. Use of perennial pigeonpea as wind breaks and as vegetative barriers in<br /><br />127<br />soil and water conservation. 5. Residual effects of perennial pigeonpea on the growth of subsequent<br />crops and on soil properties. 6. Use of perennial pigeonpea in the restoration of fertility in degraded<br />soils. 7. Nitrogen fixation under different climates and canopy management<br />practices. 8. Evaluation of different agroforestry systems under different climatic<br />conditions.<br />6. Concluding remarks<br />This paper has detailed the considerable merits and some of the problems of using perennial pigeonpea in agroforestry systems and has generally ignored the social constraints to adoption by farmers. Unlike the introduction of Leucaena leucocephala or Gliricidia sepium, perennial pigeonpea is already widely grown in south Asia and eastern Africa as a multi-purpose legume crop and its fodder is readily accepted by livestock. However, the introduction of perennial pigeonpea to new regions may suffer from the same adoption problems encountered by grain pigeonpea because the preference for pigeonpea grain is lower than for other grain legumes. The potential of perennial pigeonpea as an agroforestry species was not widely appreciated until recently, even in India. Pigeonpea is easy to establish by direct seeding and can be useful in short rotations as an improved fallow. There is a need to develop appropriate management practices, since the requirement during the second year is different from the annual grain types, and to re-introduce perennial pigeonpea as a multi-purpose species on a wider and more organised scale than hitherto practised in farmers' fields.<br /><br /></p>","/Users/kanedan29/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ukmuidcw.default/zotero/storage/DK69JP6U/Daniel_Ong_1990_Perennial pigeonpea.pdf","","Agroforestry; ALL((""long duration"" OR ""long-duration"" OR perennial) W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon pea"" OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE(ar); ALL(perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE(ar); Cajanus cajan; Fodder; full text added; Genotype; Grain yield; India; Perennial pigeonpea; Pigeonpea; relevant; Scopus; search.grain; search.pigeonpea; Soil fertility; SPV; TS=((""long duration"" OR perennial) NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); Web of Science; yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers in the Eastern Province of Zambia are faced with problems common to other parts of the tropics: increased pressure to expand food production leading to accelerated forest clearing, decrease in traditional fallow periods, increased soil erosion, and reductions in soil fertility. Of special concern are shortages of labor during their growing season, a shortage of staple foods during January through March, pest (termite) problems, and seasonal fires. Alleycropping appears able to solve some of the farmers' problems. Both on-farm and experiment station trials were initiated to screen potential agroforestry species. Perennial pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., a species indigenous to the Province, showed particular promise. Cultivars grew over 3m tall and produced up to 4.8 tons/ha dry matter (in 7 months after pruning) for green manure. Farmers reacted favorably to their experience with the on-farm trials. Ease of establishment and production of food (green pod and grain) make perennial pigeonpea a special agroforestry option in the Province, deserving additional research.<br />I. Introduction<br />In the Eastern Province of Zambia today, permanent cultivation systems have replaced the traditional shifting cultivation due to land pressure. Fallow periods of 20 years or longer, sustaining modest yields with low financial inputs, have been abandoned. Presently crops are often planted every year. Shortened fallow periods have caused declines in soil fertility and crop yields, increased clearing of steep hillsides unsuitable for crop production, and additional labor requirements to obtain fuelwood.<br />The development of sustainable and productive agricultural systems, based largely on locally available resources, is of critical importance. The integration of trees or shrubs into the current farming system is one way to sustain permanent crop production while providing food, fodder, fuelwood, and green manure.<br /><br />128<br />Given a lack of information on performance of agroforestry species in the region, research was initiated to screen tree and shrub species. Both on-farm and experiment station trials were conducted with a special focus on the particular farming systems constraints of the region. One species, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), was of special interest. Pigeonpea is commonly grown as an annual in India, and so is not often considered as a possible 'tree' species. But long-lived pigeonpea is a common sight in the Eastern Province of Zambia. Some specimens found were estimated to be older than 10 years, with stem diameters of approximately 15cm. Pigeonpea also is indigenous to East Africa [8, 10, 11], suggesting possible advantages over exotic tree species.<br />Pigeonpea gave promising results in dry matter (DM) production, nitrogen contribution through green manure, grain yields, forage production, and erosion control. Its performance suggests that pigeonpea could be successfully and easily integrated into the current farming systems of the region. This paper reports the results of that research. General background is also provided for pigeonpea and the constraints on existing farming systems in the Province.<br />2. General description of the area<br />2.1 Climate<br />The year is divided into a wet season from Nov. to April, a dry-cold season from May to Aug. and a dry-hot season from Sept. to Oct. The growing season starts in Nov. and lasts between 135 and 155 days. Total rainfall varies between 870 and 1,100 mm per annum. The mean temperature in the cold season is 17°C and 24°C in the hot season [1].<br />2.2 Soils<br />The soils, although highly variable, may be roughly classified into two major types. To the north and around Chipata, loamy sands are interspersed with red and red-brown clays (Ferric Luvisols). In hilly areas these often are replaced by Lithosols. Towards the south of the province, along the border with Mozambique, the soils are predominantly yellowish-red to light yellowish-brown loamy sands or sands (Acrisols). All soils are moderately leached and their pH ranges between 4.5 and 5.5 in average [1].<br /><br />2.3 Farming systems<br /><br />129<br /><br />Cropping systems throughout the province are centered around maize production, the staple food of the people. Farmers dedicate most attention and inputs to this crop. Local maize occupied an average 1.2 ha per farm [Harvey RH, unpublished]. Additional cash crops, in order of importance, are peanuts (0.3 ha), and hybrid maize and/or sunflower (0.2 ha). The majority of the farmers are hoe-cultivators. In the southern districts of the province a remarkable shift towards cultivation with oxen is taking place. The relative importance of crops for ox-cultivaros is similar to hoecultivators, though their cropping area is bigger (2.5 ha). The current average yields of maize are estimated to be 0.8-1.2t/ha [Eastern Province Agric. Dev. Project, unpublished].<br />Both cultivation systems share the same constraints: a shortage of labor during planting and weeding (November through January), a staple food shortage at the end of January through April, declining soil fertilities, non-available inorganic fertilizers, and increasing soil erosion. The increased use of land for food production and shortening of fallow periods has in some cases made fuel wood more difficult to obtain. During the cropping period, the herding of animals puts additional strains on the labor supply of the farming family. Free-range grazing only occurs after the crop harvest (June/July) and may be short due to devastating bush fires occurring then. Goats and fire cause great damage to trees during that time of the year.<br /><br />3. The role of agroforestry<br />The specific and ultimate criteria for an agroforestry species selection for the Eastern Province may be formulated as: 1. Tolerance to prolonged drought, termites, and bushfires, suggesting the<br />need for fast, vigorous, deep rooted species with good regrowth capability. 2. Minimum labor demand: preferably direct seeded with no seed scarification, a minimum of weeding required, and good establishment during one rainy season. 3. Supplies moderate amounts of food, recognized as such by the people, especially during the 'hungry period' from January to March. 4. Supplies nitrogen-rich mulch material for use as fertilizer. 5. Stabilizes ridges and hillsides, especially during the first heavy downpours of rain after the dry season (when there is no groundcover!). 6. Can be managed for secondary products such as fuelwood and animal feed.<br /><br />130<br />4. Pigeonpea as an agroforestry component<br />4.1 Origin, distribution and production<br />While there is some disagreement, pigeonpea may i~ave its center of origin in East Africa [6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Today pigeonpea is pantropical, reflecting its wide adaptation. The most important centers of cultivation are on the Indian-subcontinent, East Africa and the Caribbean [15]<br />The time of introduction into the south-central parts of Africa and to the Eastern Province of Zambia, either from within the continent or from outside, is unclear. Most likely it had been introduced at large by Arab traders around 900 to 1400 A.D. [7]. This would explain their more common distribution in the lower Luangwa river valley, where at the confluence of the Zambezi, a very important Arab trade post was established and maintained for a long time [7]. With the arrival of ethnic Indians during the British colonial erea, the crop gained importance through the establishment of a limited market.<br />Actual production figures for pigeonpea are scarce since the bulk of the crop is grown on homeconsumption-scale. The biggest producers in East Africa are Kenya (world's 2nd largest), Uganda, Malawi and Tanzania [15].<br />It is unclear how much of the crop is produced today in the Eastern Province. The neighboring country of Malawi is the third biggest producer on the continent [15]. In the Eastern Province pigeonpea is common around homesteads and along field-edges. Often only a few individual plants are managed as part of the farming system. It is impossible therefore to accurately estimate production. A constant supply (primarily for the ethnic Indian population) can be found on the markets in the province throughout the year.<br />4.2 Characteristics of pigeonpea<br />Pigeonpea is a member of the tribe Phaseolae Benth. subfamily Papilionideae of Leguminosae [9]. All cultivars have trifoliate leaves, bear papilionaceous flowers of 2.5cm length and multi-colored pods with constrictions between seeds. The pods are non-shattering and the 100 g weight of the seed ranges between 4 and 25 g [6, 9, 11, 15]. The agronomic distinction into three maturity classes, early (120 to 150 days), medium (150 to 180 days) and late (180 days and more) is still widely in use [6]. Most of the indigenous Zambian genotypes belong to the latter class. The plant reaches a height up to 4 m and its growth is either erect-compact or spreading [8, 10, 11]. Individuals have been found to survive for decades [8, 10, 11]. Determinate<br /><br />131<br />and indeterminate fruiting types exist [6, 8, 10]. The plant has a deep tap-root with short lateral roots. Spreading types often have longer laterals and denser spreading roots [8].<br />4.3 Uses<br />In India, pigeonpea has always been a very important source of protein for the people, largely consumed as dhal [6, 10, 11]. The use by Africans seems to be more restricted and variable. They are commonly eaten as whole, fresh pods, much like in the Caribbean [8, 10] and cooked as 'ndiwo' (a kind of relish). To a somewhat lesser extent the dry beans are also cooked [17]. Today they are widely referred to as a 'famine food'. All parts of the plant are known to be used for various medicinal purposes [10, 17]. In Malawi the bark, roots or leaves are used in a liquid for treatment of ear ailments [17]. A number of medicinal uses (i.e. sedative, analgesic) are reported from India, Java, Argentina, the Caribbean, and China [10].<br />In the Eastern Province, pigeonpea is an important source for animal feed. Pigeonpea has a high crude protein content: 29.8% for leaves and twigs [16]. As a livestock-feed it is highly esteemed in the semi-arid and wet tropics. All non-woody parts are edible, palatable, and non-toxic to ruminants and fowl [8, 10, 16, 18]. The plant has the capability of persisting under heavy browsing for many years [8]. Other reported uses of regional importance are bee-forage [8], silk-worm feed, host for lac-insects, thatching and fencing material, and fuel wood [8, 10, 11].<br />5. Experimental results<br />5.1 Genotype evaluations<br />In November 1985 an unreplicated trial with 33 pigeonpea lines as entries was planted at the Msekera Research Station near Chipata. A blanket basal dress of 40-20-20 kg/ha was broadcast and incorporated prior to planting. The seeds were hand-drilled at a row spacing of 1.5 m and at a within-row spacing of 12.5cm. Each plot had three rows of 5 m each. The lines originated in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. During the first season, mainly phenological growth observations were taken. Throughout the trial the alleys between the pigeonpea rows were kept moderately free of weeds by hand. All plants were cut back at 1m height in May 1986 and DM-yields were taken. After the first pruning in May 1986 the plants were left untouched until the following cropping season. Again growth performance was<br /><br />132<br />observed and the plants were cut back a second time at 1m height in early January 1987. Table 1 gives the results for selected lines for both seasons. Three were selected for further on-farm evaluation. This selection was largely based on DM-yield, grain yield, mortality rate and growth habit. Erect-compact indeterminate types were selected to minimize above- and below-ground competition [6, 12, 14].<br />There were dramatic differences among entries in terms of survival and persistence. The short to medium maturity types with determinate growth seemed to suffer from pruning and drought. Some of these lines did not recover during the following wet season and were sensitive to termite attackes. Lower grain yields of entries ICP 11298, 11295 and 8869 were associated<br />with heavy damage by Mylabris spp. during flowering. Pod bearing con-<br />tinued among indeterminate types after the May 86 harvest. The nitrogen yields were calculated as 2.15% of dry matter [2, 13]. During the growing season, competition from weeds appeared lower than in other crops, despite the wide row-spacing. This was attributed to the good amount of leaf litter covering the soil. Pigeonpea is reported to shed leaves throughout the year [3, 4, 5, 10]. Leaf litter quantities have been observed between 2000 [3] and 3330 kg ha-~ yr- ~[8]. The former amount was calculated to add 36 kg/ha N to the system [3]. Results at ICRISAT indicate lower values of 10 to 11 kg/ha for short and medium maturing genotypes [6].<br />Along with the nitrogen contribution to the alleycrop, additional food from pods and grains is provided for a long period of time during the year. Grain yields in Table 1 are from unpruned trees in the first season; some drop in yield is anticipated under a pruning regime. Plants whose flowers<br />were heavily attacked by Mylabrisspp. (Dec.-Feb.) showed a sharp decline<br />in reproductive yields, as in line 11295. This was associated with a stimulation of additional vegetative growth.<br />5.2 On-farm experience<br />In 1986 on-farm evaluations were established in parallel to the on-station research. Pigeonpea and other species were planted on three different sites in the districts of Chipata-North and South in November 1986.<br />At Chipata-South, a group of farmers asked for help with soil improvement, wind breaks, food, animal feed, and firewood. In 1985, ICP 11289, K423/11, and ICP 7035 were planted along the edges of the farmers' fields. On return visits, the plants were found never pruned back by the farmers and had grown up to heights of 3 m. During the second season adjacent maize rows clearly suffered from competition. When asked about this, the farmers commented about the labor demand for pruning and incorporating<br /><br />Table 1.

At a later time (after Feb.) they feared the hedges would not tolerate the pruning to survive through the dry season. They appreciated however their value as a food and windbreak and, most importantly, as a source of feed. (An additional observation of farmer practice in that area involved use of pigeonpea as a 'nurse crop'. Farmers had started planting Khaya nyasica seedlings along field edges for timber production. Seedlings received occasional hand watering in the first season. They found pigeonpea planted in a diameter of about 40 cm around their seedlings reduced damage from fires and goats [Rauch J, personal communication]. This could be attributed to suppression of weeds (that can promote fire) and pigeonpea's maintenance of green foliage throughout the year. Pigeonpea may thus act as a fire barrier while distracting goats from the seedlings inside).<br />At two other sites, in Chipata-North, farmers asked mainly for advice on how the flooding of their homesteads could be prevented. The locations were on slopes measuring 10% and 30%. The farmers' fields were on the upper parts of their land, channeling runoff water into low lying homesteads. An alleycrop was selected with three rows of combined maize (cv. MMV 600) plus climbing beans (cv. VRA 81027) at a row spacing of 0.75 m. The rows were bounded by hedges 2.25 cm apart. At both locations the land was first surveyed and contour-ridges were formed (with major ridges spaced at every 1m drop of slop). Pigeonpea lines ICP 11298 and 7035, Sesbania grandiflora, and Sesbania sesban were used as the hedge species in four plots at the first location. Lines ICP 11289 and K423/11, S. grandiflora, and S. sesban were used in four plots at the second location. All crops and trees were directly seeded at the beginning of December. No fertilizers were applied to either pigeonpea or Sesbania. Field management was performed by the farmers.<br />Pigeonpea emerged uniformly within 10 days and established well to 0.4 m height within 30 to 40 days. Weed control was inadequate and weeds became well established along with the pigeonpea. At 50 to 60 days after sowing, the growth of the pigeonpea accelerated. It gained increasing dominance within the cropping system, and plants reached an average height of 1.7 m at the time of maize flowering. From then on, weeds in the whole plot were effectively suppressed. Weeds within maize rows never established well due to the good canopy cover provided by the climbing beans. At both sites, rats and termites were a problem for maize (exacerbated by an unusually dry December and January). Survival rates of the pigeonpea after the season were around 82%. At both locations, farmers believed the hedges were effective in reducing erosion. Field observations revealed that uniform, close spacings within the row (approximately 12.5 cm) were necessary for effective erosion control.<br /><br />Table 2. Agroforestry species evaluated at Chipata/Zambia<br /><br />Acacia albiba Acacia magium Acach7 tortil&amp; Azadirachta indica Balanites aegyptica Cassia spectabilis Casuarina equisetifolia Cordia abyssinica Eucalyptus grandis Eucalyptus lesnifera<br /><br />Flemingia congesta Gmelina arborea Khaya nyasica Leucaena leucocephala Maesopsis eminii Parkinsonia aculeata Sesbania grandiflora Sesbania sesban Vitex keniensis<br /><br />135<br /><br />The farmers decided the use of the hedges. In all cases some pods and grain were collected for food and the trees were left for free-range browsing of cattle and goats over the dry season. At one site the farmer reported that overbrowsing by goats had killed many of the plants. He thought it not much of a problem since seeds were in ample supply for replanting next season.<br />None of the participating farmers regretted the trees on their land and all found them in one way or another useful. At the same time they expressed concerns about their labor shortage during the growing season and felt they would be unable to spend time managing their trees during that time.<br />5.3 Other agroforestry species<br />Other agroforestry species were planted in an observation nursery for comparison with pigeonpea at Msekera in 1986 (Table 2).<br />The following species were killed by termites during the first two months of study and were eliminated from further evaluation: Acacia mangium, Casuarina equisetifolia, Ecualyptis spp. All other species established reasonably well, but only Cassia spectabilis, Flemingia congesta, Parkinsonia aculeata, S. grandiflora and S. sesban showed fast and vigorous initial growth and compared favorably with pigeonpea. They were found suitable for direct seeding on-farm. Maesopsis eminii had a very fast initial growth and dense canopy establishment, but did not germinate when directly seeded. Gmelina arborea behaved similar to Maesopsis, though initial growth was somewhat slower. Promising, especially in terms of drought resistance and termite resistance, were all other Acacia spp., Balanites aegyptica, K. nyasica and Vitex keniensis, although their growth rates were extremely slow and they required intensive weeding in the nursery. These species are timber species and therefore fill a niche distinct from pigeonpea. Leucaena leucocephala most likely suffered under acidic soil conditions (pH 5.0) [Holden S, personal communication].<br /><br />136<br />Unlike pigeonpea, Sesbania, Flemingia, and P. aculeata emerged over a 2 to 3 month period (seeds were not pretreated). This led to a large variation in plant growth stages. Very small seedlings were found below the heavy weed canopy. At maturity of the weeds, the seedlings seemed to have no problem 'pushing' through and overgrowing the weeds. Survival of the latest emerged seedlings (Feb.; 5 to 10cm height) through the following dry season was low. In all cases S. grandiflora was found to emerge faster, more uniformly, and with higher initial growth rates than S. sesban. However, the former one reportedly does not tolerate coppicing and would thus not be very valuable in an alleycroping system [Evans D, personal communication]). The latest emerging species were F. congesta and P. aculeata - some of them as late as March. P. aculeata, despite its short period of establishment, was able to persist throughout the following dry season and had good survival rates (Schermer M, personal communication). The survival rate was also good, though somewhat lower, for F. congesta (Phirri S, personal communication).<br />Damage from free-ranging goats was observed in the species trial. No differences among the species were observed: all would be defoliated if left unprotected in the presence of high goat populations. Considerable mortality is anticipated for all species under these conditions.<br />6. Future research needs for pigeonpea in agroforestry<br />Additional data on the amount of pigeonpea leaf litter and fuel wood production need to be collected. At the same time, different management practices in alleycropping systems with maize should be tested. Although the cutting height used in this study (1 m) seems a reasonable practice, other heights would produce different results (influencing DM production and stand longevity) without adding significantly to the labor requirement. The optimum time of pruning - to minimize light competition and supply N for maize production - is unknown.<br />Considerable controversy exists about the importance of belowground interactions. It is unclear if and how much pigeonpea competes for nutrients and water and if there are any genotypic differences.<br />All future research should strictly address farming system constraints that have been identified locally. Labor demand should, in this sense, be given priority. We do not know the change in labor demand in aUeycroping systems versus existing systems. There are indications that the labor demand might be increased. If so, how much do the pigeonpea hedges reduce weed pressure in the field? How much labor is then made available for pruning<br /><br />137<br />Fig. 1. A mixed hedgerow of pigeonpea (right) and S. grandiflora in an alleycropping system with maize. Pigeonpea (directly seeded) and Sesbania (transplanted) are both approximately three months old in the field. Note heavy weed-pressure; weeds on ridge were removed for picture.<br /><br />138<br />and incorporation of green manure? This should be a focus in attempts to optimize the management of alleycropping systems. Also a fair economic comparison between costs for these organic manures and inorganic fertilizers has to be established to estimate the returns to land and to labor for each system.<br />The potential benefits of species mixtures in the hedge rows needs to be addressed. Pigeonpea may complement other species such as S. sesban, F. congesta, and P. aculeata (see Fig. 1). This would help to diversify the system and may stabilize production and survival rates of the hedge.<br />7. Conclusion<br />In the Eastern Province of Zambia, any kind of agroforestry concept will only be adopted by farmers if immediate and noticeable returns are provided by the trees, such as food and feed, with little additional strain on the labor supply of the farming families.<br />In on-farm and experiment station observations, pigeonpea showed high potential to alleviate some of these constraints. Pigeonpea was easy to plant, exhibited vigorous growth, and required little attention in the field. Its labor requirements were thus low compared to other possible agroforestry species. A number of those species were found to be unsuited to the Province, having high mortality rates. Pigeonpea - an indigenous species - may prove to have a number of adaptive advantages.<br />Anticipating two cuttings per growing season at a height of 1m, it was demonstrated that the N-contribution within an alleycropping system, such as with maize, can be between 40 to 50kgN/(hayr) from DM and 10kg/ (ha yr) from leaf litter using a very conservative calculation. At current recommended fertilizer levels for maize in the province, farmers could save their whole top-dressing by using pigeonpea as a source of organic nitrogen. However, the optimum management of such a system is still subject to further investigations.<br />Substantial amounts of food, recognized as such by the local people, from pods and grain, can be supplied by the plant from Jan./Feb. throughout the dry season. Simultaneously, animals were able to browse the pigeonpea. Pigeonpea's production of human food and its ease of establishment, coupled with its characteristics as a nitrogen fixing tree, make perennial pigeonpea a special choice for farmers in the Eastern Province of Zambia. The species deserves additional research to expands its use in agroforestry systems over a wider range of environments.<br /><br />Acknowledgements<br /><br />139<br /><br />Support for this project in Zambia was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Development/Zambia and the German Development Service/Zambia.

The presence of such<br />0378-4290/86/$03.50 © 1986 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.<br /><br />34<br />a gravel layer affects many of the physical properties of these soils. Babalola and Lal (1977a) reported that increasing subsoil gravel concentrations affected the pore size distribution and total porosity, increased overall bulk density and decreased water holding capacity. In addition, growth and elongation of root systems of most annual crops into the deeper regions of the profile were also impeded (Lal et al., 1975; Babalola and Lal, 1977b). The mechanism of root growth inhibition is through confinement of the soil between gravel particles, thereby hindering expansion of the soil pores, which is essential for root elongation (Vine et al., 1981). The eventual outcome is a decrease in the effective rooting depth, which renders crops more prone to drought during rain-free periods of the growing season and to nutrient stress. Drought avoidance is therefore partly dependent upon the root systems penetrating the subsoil gravel layer. Increasing the proportion of root-sized pores in the gravel layer by biological {through old root and earthworm channels) or mechanical {subsoiling) methods may alleviate water and nutrient stresses created by the gravelly horizon (Elkins et al., 1977; Vine et al., 1981; Williams and Elkins, 1982; Williams et al., 1982).<br />Although root growth of most annual crops is inhibited by the gravel layer, this is not so with some perennials. Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Acioa barterii and Alchornea cordifolia are some examples o f these perennials (Rachie and Roberts, 1974; Hurd and Spratt, 1975; IITA, 1984). It has been postulated, therefore, that if a crop of high root penetrating ability was to be followed by a crop with low root penetrating ability, the root channels created by the earlier crop might result in a deep rooting habit by the later crop. This has been demonstrated in the southern United States, where porosity of compacted layers in the subsoil was found to be increased by various cultivars of bahia grass (Paspalum notatum Fl~igg) and tall fescue (Festuca atundinaceae Shreb.). The following cotton was able to utilize the increased porosity, as was evidenced by a deeper root penetration and consequently more yield (Elkins et al., 1977; Williams and Elkins, 1982; Williams et al., 1982).<br />Increased porosity in the subsoil can also be brought about by the biotic activity stimulated by zero tillage. Continuity of pores created by deep rooting crops are conversely lost by the ""smearing"" action of conventional tillage systems (Lal, 1983). However, quantitative data on this aspect of notillage is scarce.<br />The objective of this study, therefore, was to quantify the interactive effects of a deep-rooted crop and zero tillage on soil properties and root growth of the following maize crops in a gravelly Alfisol.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />The experiment was conducted at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria. IITA is located approximately 30 km south of the northern limit of the lowland rainforest. The annual rainfall<br /><br />35<br />ranges between 1000--1500 mm. There are two growing seasons, due to the bimodal character of rainfall distribution: the first from late March to late July, ending in a short dry spell of approximately 1 month; and a shorter second season from late August to early November. The dry season lasts from November to March.<br />The soil at the experimental site is gleyic Udic Haplustalf. A layer of angular and sub-angular quartz {""gravel layer"") is located at a depth of approximately 0.35 m. The gravel content (w/w%) at depths of 0.30--0.40 m and 0.40--0.50 m is 52.2% and 54.9%, respectively. The pH {water) is 6.5, and CEC is 41.2 mmol (+) kg-'. Soil texture is such that sand, silt and clay content are 72.6%, 15.6% and 11.8%, respectively.<br />Three tillage treatments and two cropping sequences were used in this study. The tillage systems were: (a) zero tillage, the sowing of seeds into the residue of the previous crop, with weeds being controlled by the application of 1.0 kg ha -1 a.i. of paraquat (1-1'-dimethyl-4-4'-bipyridinium ion) as a split application 1 week prior to and at sowing; (b) reduced tillage, chisel ploughing to approximately 0.35 m in the first season (March--July), followed by zero tillage in the second season (August--November); and (c) conventional tillage, disc-plowing to approximately 0.20 m. The cropping sequences<br />were: pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan)--maize (Zea rnays L. cv. TZESR-W) and<br />continuous maize. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot design with three replications. Tillage system was main plot treatment, and cropping sequence was the sub-plot treatment. All main plots were arranged as randomized blocks. Each subplot was 4 × 10 m in area. Pigeon pea was sown in April 1983, and maize in April and August, 1983. All plots were sown to maize in March and August, 1984. Plant spacings used were 0.75 m and 0.25 m between and within rows respectively, for maize, and 0.75 m and 0.30 m between and within rows, respectively, for pigeon pea. Fertilizer was applied at planting as a single application o f 300 kg ha-1 o f 15 : 15 : 15 NPK.<br />Root growth was measured with the core-break method {Drew and Saker, 1980). Cores (70 mm in diameter and 85 mm high) were taken at 100-mm depth increments in the soil profile within and between plant rows. The cores were then broken horizontally and the roots exposed at the broken<br />face counted. R o o t number was converted to root length density, Lv, follow-<br />ing the procedure of Drew and Saker {1980). Root length beneath unit ground area, LA, was calculated for each ciay of measurement as<br />fz Lv"" dz<br />where z is depth o f rooting. Soil bulk density was measured on undisturbed cores (70 mm in diameter<br />and 85 mm high). Bent-stem mercury-in-glass soil thermometers were installed at a depth of 50 mm in all plots and read daily at 1400 h. In situ soil water retention curves were determined for the 500--600 mm depth in all plots. Soil water potential was monitored using dial-type tensiometers. Soil water content was measured gravimetrically. Soil samples obtained from the<br /><br />36<br /><br />0--200 mm depth were analyzed for organic carbon (dichromate oxidation), total N (Kjeldahl digestion), Bray-l-P and 1 N NH4OAC extractable Ca, Mg, Na, K and Mn, and 1 N KC1 extractable total acidity (A1 + H). The pH was determined in a 1 : 1 soil:water suspension. The activity of the earthworm Hyperiodrilus africanus was monitored indirectly by counting and weighing the aboveground casts produced by earthworms over an area of 5 m X 2 m per unit time in each plot.<br /><br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br /><br />Maize root growth, 1984<br /><br />Root growth was measured at 30 and 63 days after sowing (DAS) during the first season {Fig. 1) and 57 DAS during the second season (Fig. 2).<br /><br />ROOTLENGTH DENSITY(rn m-3)<br /><br />o.oO 2~o .4ooo ,so~o<br />I.LSO(IO.05)<br /><br />2,ooo ~ ~ ~_so(opI<br /><br />O.2 f<br />0.4 O0<br /><br />I-4 Zero Till oQe<br />.LSO(0.9""~)<br /><br />P---t H<br />LS~D(005)<br /><br />JO.2<br />Z I0,.<br />Wo 0.4<br /><br />-<br />ConmntionolTillage<br /><br />14<br />Co~entionol Tillage<br /><br />0.0 LSD(0.05) P-.--I<br /><br />0.2 f<br /><br />I--I I--I<br /><br />1""-4<br />0.4<br /><br />Reduced Tilloge<br /><br />Reduced Tliloge<br /><br />0.0<br /><br />30 OAp<br /><br />63 OAp<br /><br />Fig. 1.

Effect of tillage system and cropping sequence on root growth of maize, August-November, 1984. (x), Pigeon pea--maize; (~), continuous maize.<br />Thirty DAS zero- and reduced-tilled plots sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence had 82.7% and 67.3%, respectively, more roots in the 0.20--0.30 m depth, than plots continuously cropped to maize. Among tillage systems, depth of the deepest root was 0.25 m in both zero- and reduced-tillage plots, and 0.15 m in conventionally-tilled plots. Overall root growth was also greater in the former treatments: root length per unit area, LA, was 880, 781<br /><br />38<br />and 442 m m -2 (LSD, 0.05 = 280) in zero-, reduced- and conventionallytilled plots, respectively. Sixty-three DAS all treatments had extended their root systems down to the gravel layer, i.e. the 0.35 m depth. Among cropping sequences root growth differed only in the 0.20--0.30 m depth of zerotilled plots. Root length density at this depth in zero-tilled plots planted to a pigeon pea--maize sequence was 139.1% greater than the corresponding plots continuously cropped to maize. Among tillage systems overall root growth was in the order of zero tillage ~ reduced tillage ~ conventional tillage. LA was 1071, 719 and 496 m m -2 (LSD, 0.05 = 174) in zero-, reduced- and conventionally-tilled plots. Root proliferation at depth was also greater in the two former treatments, with root length density in the 0.300.40 m depth interval being five times as much as that in conventionallytilled plots.<br />Fifty-seven DAS during the second season, root growth of maize in zerotilled plots sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence was greater at all depths than the control treatment, such that LA of the former was 1640 m m -2 and that of the latter 1110 m m -2 (LSD, 0.05 = 190). Roots in both treatments had, however, penetrated to a depth of 0.45 m. Among other treatments it was only in reduced-tilled plots which had been sown to pigeon pea-maize where roots were found to be at a depth of 0.45 m. In other treatments, roots were confined to a depth of 0.35 m. Among tillage systems zero-tilled plots were found to have the greatest root growth. L A of zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots were 1340, 910 and 690 m m -2, respectively (LSD, 0.05 = 280).<br />The general pattern of root growth observed among tillage systems was in the order of zero tillage ~ reduced tillage ~ conventional tillage. Among zero-tilled plots, those sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence had a greater level of root growth than plots cropped continuously to maize. Depth of the deepest root was, however, the same (i.e. 0.45 m) in both cropping sequences. Cropping sequence did not affect root growth in other tillage systems.<br />Grain yield<br />Grain yield of maize (Table 1) in the pigeon pea--maize sequence outyielded that of the continuous maize sequence by 40.0% and 22.7% in the first and second seasons, respectively. Among tillage systems, grain yield in zero-tilled and reduced-tilled plots exceeded that of conventionally-tilled plots by 35.0% and 30.0%, respectively, during the first season, and 66.7% and 44.4%, respectively, during the second season.<br />So il physical properties<br />Bulk density Bulk density in the 0--100 mm depth was measured at 2, 29 and 90 DAS<br /><br />39<br /><br />TABLE 1<br /><br />Grain yield of maize, 1984 (t ha-1)<br /><br />First season<br /><br />Second season<br /><br />A.

Among cropping sequences bulk density of plots sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence was in all instances lower than in plots continuously cropped to maize. At 2, 29, and 90 DAS these differences were of the order of 2.2%, 3.7% and 4.5%, respectively, and can be attributed to increased worm activity and the fact that tap-rooted legumes such as pigeon pea improve soil porosity more than plant species with fibrous root systems such as maize (Wilson et al., 1982). Worm activity was such that 90 DAS in the first season there were 244 and 45 kg of worm casts per ha in the plots planted to pigeon pea--maize and continuous maize sequences, respectively.<br />Two DAS bulk density of zero-tilled plots was greater than that of conventionally4illed plots by 4.4%, apparently due to the loosening of the soil by tillage operations. Twenty-nine DAS, however, bulk density of reducedtilled plots was lower than that of conventionally-tilled plots by 7.4%. At<br /><br />40<br /><br />harvest, 90 DAS, bulk density of conventionally-tilled plots was greater than those of zero-tilled and reduced-tilled plots by 6.7% and 10.8%, respectively. Bulk density in conventionally-tilled plots was found to increase over time, whereas with the other tillage treatments there was a decrease. The decrease in soil bulk density in no-till and reduced-tilled plots may be attributed to the combined effects of increased earthworm activity and protection of the soil surface by residue mulch. At 90 DAS in the first season there were 389, 51 and 0.0 kg of worm casts per ha in zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots. Neither earthworms nor residue mulch are a feature of conventionally-tilled softs (Lal, 1983).<br /><br />Soil temperature During the first growing season of 1984 significant differences in soil temperature at 1400 h (Fig. 3) due to cropping sequence were found only with zero tillage, where plots sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence had lower temperatures than those continuously cropped with maize; the seasonal mean temperature in the former sequence was 32.8°C, in comparison to 34.7°C in the latter (LSD, 0.05 = 1.1).

Seasonal mean temperature at 1400 h was 33.8, 35.5 and 39.7°C (LSD, 0.05 = 1.2) in zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots, respectively.<br />Soil temperatures at 1400 h in the second growing season (August-November) of 1984 were lower than in the first growing season. Similar to the first growing season, soil temperature in zero-tilled plots sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence was lower than in the corresponding plots cropped continuously with maize. Seasonal mean temperatures were 31.6 and 33.1°C (LSD, 0.05 = 0.7) for pigeon pea--maize and continuous maize, respectively. Among tillage systems seasonal mean temperature was 32.4, 32.4 and 35.5°C (LSD, 0.05 = 1.2) in zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventional-tilled plots, respectively.<br />Soil water retention in the 500--600 mm depth Cropping sequence did not affect soil water retention at any one potential. Mean water content at soil water potentials of 0, -10, -33, -50 and -70kPa were 15.22, 7.88, 7.83, 7.81 and 7.79m3m-3%, respectively. Among tillage systems, however, more water was retained at 0 kPa by zerotilled plots in comparison with reduced and conventional tillage systems. This was in the order of 18.85, 11.78, and 13.88% by volume (LSD, 0.05 = 3.53) for zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots, respectively. Water retention at other potentials did not differ significantly. Mean soil water content at soil water potentials of -10, -33, -50 and -70 kPa were 7.76, 7.71, 7.69 and 7.68 m 3 m-3%, respectively. Increases in total porosity of the gravel layer have therefore occurred following zero tillage. Similar increases have not occurred following sowing with pigeon pea, although pigeon pea roots were found at a depth of 1.15 m, 163 DAS during 1983. Deep-rooted legumes, such as pigeon pea, are known primarily to increase the proportion of macropores (radius &gt; 5 #m) (Wilson et al., 1982). It may be, therefore, that the effect of pigeon pea roots on total porosity of the gravel layer was to increase the proportion of macropores rather than micropores. Increased porosity in the gravel layer of zerotilled plots may be due to higher levels of earthworm activity.<br />Soil chemical properties Samples obtained from the 0--200 mm depth at 70 DAS during the first season of 1984 indicated that in relation to continuous maize, planting of pigeon pea prior to maize significantly increased levels of organic carbon, exchangeable Ca, Mg and K, and cation exchange capacity by 28.0%, 23.5%, 47.4%, 16.3% and 21.6%, respectively (Table 3). However, pH, total nitrogen, available Bray-l-P, exchangeable Mn, Na and total acidity, were not affected, showing mean values of 5.7, 0.13%, 7.0 ppm, 0.3, 2.0 and 0.5 mmol (+) kg-', respectively. Among tillage systems significant differences in soil chemical properties occurred only with respect to total N. This was in the order of 0.16%, 0.16% and 0.11% (LSD, 0.05 = 0.04) for zero-tilled, reduced-tilled and conventionally-tilled plots.<br /><br />42<br /><br />TABLE 3<br /><br />Soil chemical properties in the 0--200 mm depth which were affected by cropping sequence, 70 DAS, first season, 1984<br /><br />Cropping<br />sequence<br /><br />Organic NH4OACextractable cations Total CEC<br /><br />carbon (%) (mmol (+) kg-~)<br /><br />(retool(+) kg-~)<br /><br />Ca Mg K<br /><br />Pigeon pea--maize 1.28a Continuous maize 1.00b<br /><br />26.3a 5.6a 5.7a 21.3b 3.8b 4.9b<br /><br />40.0a 32.9b<br /><br />Means within the same column which are followed by the same letterdo not differsignificantlyat the 5% levelof probability(Duncan's Multiple Range Test).<br /><br />Effect of soil properties on root growth and grain yield<br />Regression of root length per unit area (m m-2) (Y) with bulk density (Mg m -3) in the 0--100 mm depth (X1), mean weekly soil temperature (°C) at time of root sampling (X2), soil water content (m 3 m -3) in the 5 0 0 - 6 0 0 mm depth at 0 kPa (X3), organic carbon (%) (X4), total N (%) (Xs), exchangeable Ca (X6), Mg (XT) and K (Xs) (mmol (+) kg-~), total cation exchange capacity (mmol (+) kg-~) (Xg) and earthworm activity (kg casts per ha) (X~o) indicated that factors XI, X2, X3, Xs and X~0 were significantly correlated with root growth.

In addition to the widespread occurrence of natural subsoil barriers, tropical soils are also susceptible to compaction, particularly when motorized farm operations are used. In view of the present findings, a useful appraisal is needed of the relative merits and economics of mechanical versus biological measures for alleviating soil compaction. Although subsoiling in the row zone by chiseling or paraplough may be affordable and useful for some soils, periodic fallowing with deep-rooted woody legumes and shrubs is an ecologically compatible and durable alternative.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br /><br />(1) Root growth of maize was greatest in zero-tilled plots. Among zerotilled plots, those that were planted to pigeon pea in the previous year had more roots than those that were planted to maize.<br />(2) Porosity in the gravel layer at a depth of 500--600 mm was increased by zero tillage. Although pigeon pea roots were observed in this layer during the previous year, significant differences in porosity were not found among cropping sequences. It was thought that the effect of pigeon pea roots on the gravel layer was to increase the proportion of macropores, rather than total porosity.<br />(3) Among tillage systems, improvement in soil physical properties was in the order of zero tillage &gt; reduced tillage &gt; conventional tillage. A strong interaction between zero tillage and cropping sequence resulted in a greater improvement in soil physical properties, particularly the hydrothermal regime, in plots which were sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence.<br />(4) Plots which were sown to a pigeon pea--maize sequence had higher levels of organic carbon, exchangeable Ca, Mg and K, and total cation exchange capacity than plots planted to a continuous maize sequence.<br />{5) Earthworm activity was stimulated both by zero tillage and pigeon pea--maize cropping sequence.<br />(6) Whereas soil physical parameters are a major determinant of root growth in Alfisols, yield was correlated with combination of soil physical, chemical and biological factors.<br /><br /></p>","/Users/kanedan29/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ukmuidcw.default/zotero/storage/ZGHR3SNS/Hulugalle_Lal_1986_Root growth of maize in a compacted gravelly tropical alfisol as affected by.pdf","","full text added; (""long duration"" or perennial) W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon-pea"" OR ""pigeonpea"" OR ""pigeon pea""); relevant; ScienceDirect; search.pigeonpea; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field Crops Res., 10: 323--332.<br />In Peninsular India medium duration pigeonpeas (Cajanus cajan) are normally sown soon after the onset of the monsoon, in June or July; they mature around December, when they are usually cut down and removed from the field. However, if they are harvested by ratooning or by picking the pods, the plants go on to produce a second flush of pods, which matures around March. In experiments conducted in four growing seasons at ICRISAT Center, second harvest yields were usually greater for non-ratooned than ratooned plants, and in experiments conducted on Vertisols they were greater for the plants ratooned high up in the plant than for those cut closer to the ground.

On Alfisols second harvest yields were approximately doubled by a single irrigation, but there was less response to irrigation on Vertisols.

The most commonly used cultivars are of medium duration (5--6 months), and mature after the end of the monsoon. At that time they are usually cut down and threshed (Pathak, 1970; Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979a). However, owing to their perennial nature (Sheldrake, 1979; Sheldrake and Narayanan, 1979b), plants left in the field produce a new flush of pods which mature by March or April, when a second<br />0378-4290/85/$03.30 © 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.<br /><br />324<br /><br />TABLE 1<br /><br />Details of experiments on second harvest yields of m e d i u m duration pigeonpeas carried out at I C R I S A T Center<br /><br />Year<br /><br />Soil Fertilizer<br /><br />Treatments<br /><br />Design<br /><br />Subplot size (m)<br /><br />Date (a) sowing (b) ratooning (c) irrigation<br /><br />1976--77 Alfisol 50 kg P~O~ Nonratooned, and Split plot<br /><br />8×9 (a) Jul 6<br /><br />per ha; 22 kg ratooned at<br /><br />(cvs. in<br /><br />(b) Nov 18<br /><br />ZnSO 4<br /><br />60 cm<br /><br />main plots)<br /><br />(c) -<br /><br />per ha<br /><br />3 reps.<br /><br />1976--77 Vertisol 50 kg P2Oj Nonratooned, and Split plot<br /><br />8×9 (a) Jun 29<br /><br />(a) per ha; 22 kg ratooned at 90, (evs. in<br /><br />(b) Dec 28<br /><br />ZnSO4 per ha 60, 30 or 10 cm main plots)<br /><br />(c) -<br /><br />3 reps.<br /><br />1976--77 Vertisol 50 kg P205 Nonratooned, and Split plot<br /><br />8×9 (a) Jun 30<br /><br />(b)<br /><br />per ha; 22 kg ratooned at<br /><br />(cvs. in<br /><br />(b) Dec 6<br /><br />ZnSO4 per ha 60 cm<br /><br />main plots)<br /><br />(c) -<br /><br />3 reps.<br /><br />1977--78 Alfisol<br /><br />20 kg P2Os per ha; 25 kg ZnSO4 per ha.<br /><br />Nonratooned, and Split plot<br /><br />8.5×4<br /><br />ratooned 60 em (irrigations<br /><br />in main plots)<br /><br />5 reps.<br /><br />(a) Jul 5 (b) Dec 21 (c) Dec 30<br /><br />1977--78 Vertisol 20 kg P205 (a) per ha; 25 kg<br />ZnSO4perha<br /><br />Nonratooned, and ratooned at 90, 45 orl0cm<br /><br />Split plot<br /><br />8.5×4<br /><br />(irrigation<br /><br />in main plots)<br /><br />3 reps.<br /><br />(a) Jul 7 (b) Jan 16 (c) Jan 6<br /><br />1977--78 Vertisol 20 kg P20 s Nonratooned, and Split plot<br /><br />8.5×4<br /><br />(b) per ha; 25 kg ratooned at 60 cm (irrigation<br /><br />ZnSO4 per ha.<br /><br />in main plots)<br /><br />3 reps.<br /><br />(a) Jul 7 (b) Jan 16 (c) Jan 6<br /><br />1978--79 Alfisol<br /><br />125 kg P205 N o n r a t o o n e d ; a n d Split plot<br /><br />10X5.3 (a) Jul 3<br /><br />per ha; 25 kg ratooned at 60 cm (irrigation<br /><br />(b) Dec 6<br /><br />ZnSO, per ha. or single harvest in main plots)<br /><br />(c) Dec 12<br /><br />in February<br /><br />6 reps.<br /><br />1978--79 Vertisol 100 kg<br /><br />Nonratooned; and Split plot<br /><br />11×4.5(a) Jul 1<br /><br />diammonium ratooned at 90 (irrigation<br /><br />(b) Dec 12<br /><br />phosphate or 45 cm, or<br /><br />in main plots)<br /><br />(c) Dec 19<br /><br />per ha;<br /><br />single harvest<br /><br />4 reps.<br /><br />160 kg P206 in March<br /><br />per ha; 80 kg<br /><br />ZnSO4 per ha.<br /><br />1980--81 Alfisol nil<br /><br />Nonratooned, and Randomized 9X4.5 (a) Jul 4<br /><br />ratooned at 45 cm block<br /><br />(b) Dec 2<br /><br />4 reps.<br /><br />(c) -<br /><br />325<br /><br />harvest can be taken. The additional yield obtained in this way can be quite high, sometimes equalling the first harvest yield (Sharma et al., 1978; Wallis<br />et al., 1981). In view of the potential of this system for increasing the productivity of<br />pigeonpea, we have investigated the second harvest yields which can be obtained after harvesting the first crop of pods either by ratooning or by picking the pods from the plants. We carried out experiments both on Alfisols and Vertisols, which differ considerably in their water-holding capacity.<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Experiments were carried out from 1976 to 1981 at ICRISAT Center, Patancheru (17'N, 78'E; 500 m elevation) 25 km north-west of Hyderabad, India. The trials were carried out on both Alfisol and Vertisol, in different fields each year. The Alfisols in these fields hold less than 100 mm of available water and the Vertisols about 250 mm.<br />In all cases, medium duration cultivars were sown by hand soon after the beginning of the monsoon season in rows of 75 cm apart, along the tops of ridges, with a plant-to-plant spacing of 30 cm. In 1976--77 cvs. No. 148 and AS-71-37 were used, and in the other years cv. BDN-1.<br />Nine experiments were carried out, the details of which are given in Table 1. Except in the Vertisol trial in 1978--79, no nitrogenous fertilizer was used. The roots of the plants nodulated naturally with native Rhizobia. The crops were protected against pest attack by sprays of endosulfan as and when necessary, and kept free of weeds by hand weeding.<br />The ratooning treatments were carried out by hand using either shears or small sickles. Irrigations (5 cm) were given through the furrows between the ridges.<br /><br />TABLE 2<br /><br />Meteorological data for the four planting seasons at ICRISAT Center<br /><br />Year<br /><br />Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr<br /><br />Total monthly rainfall (mm)<br /><br />1976--77 86 219 299<br /><br />74<br /><br />1 30<br /><br />1977--78 67 184 194 40 59 28<br /><br />1978--79 181 228 516 82 71 10<br /><br />1980--81 141 127 306 153 6 1<br /><br />00008<br /><br />2 17 26<br /><br />4 56<br /><br />1 0 41 0 3<br /><br />2 16<br /><br />0 77<br /><br />3<br /><br />Open pan evaporation (mm)<br /><br />1976--77 302 165 123 140 193 124 148 176 202 301 307 1977--78 278 177 131 166 153 136 144 149 170 321 321 1978--79 256 140 108 127 161 129 146 165 170 291 345 1980--81 255 181 124 134 186 167 162 155 226 288 336<br /><br />326<br /><br />The second harvests were taken in March--April, excluding the borders of the plots.<br />Data on monthly rainfall and evaporation for the growing seasons 1976-1981 are given in Table 2.<br /><br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br /><br />Second harvest yields on Alfisols<br /><br />On Alfisol, unirrigated plants from which the first harvest had been taken<br /><br />TABLE 3<br /><br />First harvest grain yields of pigeonpeas grown on Alfisols or Vertisol in different years and second harvest yields of non-ratooned and ratooned plants, with or without a single irrigation soon after the first harvest.

The mean first yield was 1210 kg/ha.<br />In 1977--78 and 1978--79, a single irrigation given soon after the first harvest in December approximately doubled the yields of the non-ratooned plants, from 704 to 1538 kg/ha and from 531 to 1093 kg/ha, respectively (Table 3). This large response to irrigation is not surprising in view of the low water-holding capacity of the Alfisol and the very low rainfall from November onwards (Table 2).<br />The mean second harvest yield of unirrigated ratooned plants was 421 kg/ ha, compared with 802 kg/ha on non-ratooned plants from which the pods had been picked by hand at the time of first harvest. In each experiment a similar pattern was apparent, both with and without irrigation (Table 3).<br />The non-ratooned plants produced a new flush of flowers soon after the first harvest, but in the ratooned plants flowering mostly occurred on new shoots which took time to develop; hence the second flush of pods was delayed. In unirrigated plants in the 1977--78 experiments, for example, the second flush on the non-ratooned plants matured by 2 March but on the ratooned plants only by 4 April. With irrigation, the pattern was similar, although the dates of maturity were slightly later, on 7 March and 8 April, respectively.<br />Thus one probable reason for the lower yields of the ratooned plants is that the delay in the development of the second flush of pods exposed the plants to greater water stress. In this period there was almost no rainfall, and the plants were relying on extracting residual moisture from the soil while the temperatures and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere were rising (Table 2).<br />A second reason for the lower yield of ratooned than non-ratooned plants is that more of them died after the first harvest (Table 4). The main cause of death was fusarium wilt disease. Susceptibility of plants to this disease is increased by ratooning and defoliation, probably because the reduced supply<br /><br />TABLE 4<br /><br />Percentage mortality of non-ratooned and ratooned pigeonpeas grown on Alfisols<br /><br />Year<br /><br />C u l t i v a r Irrigated (I)<br /><br />Non-<br /><br />Ratooning height (cm) SE<br /><br />or ratooned<br /><br />nonirrigated (NI)<br /><br />60 45<br /><br />1976--77 1977--78 1978--79 1980--81<br /><br />No. 148 AS-71-37 BDN-1 BDN-1 BDN-1<br />BDN-1<br /><br />NI NI NI<br />I NI<br />I NI<br /><br />10<br /><br />39<br /><br />ND a<br /><br />± 8.9<br /><br />7 33 ND ± 10.4<br /><br />2 34 ND ± 8.2<br /><br />1 17 N D _+ 4 . 3<br /><br />1 1 2 N D -+ 2.1<br /><br />1 1 ND ± 0.8<br /><br />3 ND 16 ± 3.0<br /><br />a ND = not determined.<br /><br />328<br />of assimilates to the roots reduces their ability to resist the entry and/or development of the fungal pathogen (Sheldrake et al., 1978). Cultivars differ in their susceptibility to this disease, and this is a major reason for differences among cultivars in the ability of plants to survive ratooning (Sharma et al., 1978).<br />Second harvest yields of non-ratooned plants on Vertisols<br />The second harvest yield of non-ratooned plants grown without irrigation on Vertisols ranged from 135--660 kg/ha and on Alfisols from 531-1167 kg/ha (Table 3). With irrigation the second harvest yields of nonratooned plants on Vertisols did not exceed 551 kg/ha, and in the two experiments in 1977/78 irrigation even led to a slight reduction in yield compared with non-irrigated controls (Table 3). By contrast, on Alfisols irrigation led to an approximate doubling of the yield of non-ratooned plants, giving a yield as high as 1538 kg/ha (Table 3).<br />This striking difference between the second harvest yields on Vertisol and Alfisol was observed repeatedly (Table 3). On both soils different fields were used each year. Moreover, except in 1976--77, when growth was poor in the trial on a Vertisol (one reason for which seemed to be boron toxicity), the first harvest yields were higher on Vertisols than on Alfisols (Table 3); it was only in respect of second harvest yields that plants performed better on Alfisols.<br />This was the opposite of what we had expected. During the season in which the second flush is produced, the plants depend almost entirely on residual moisture within the soil. The water storage capacity of Vertisols is high (around 250 mm in our fields) while that of Alfisols, which are shallow and contain less clay, are relatively low, usually less than 100 mm (Reddy and Virmani, 1981).<br />We investigated whether the lower second harvest yields on Vertisols were due to nutrient or micronutrient deficiencies. In several separate experiments, we failed to obtain any significant response to spraying the plants with phosphate (in the form of potassium polyphosphate), micronutrient mixtures or zinc sulphate. The analysis of leaf tissue did not suggest that the plants on Vertisols were suffering from nutrient deficiencies; nor were the nutrient or micronutrient levels in the surface or the deeper regions of the soil sufficiently low to make it likely that the plants would be deficient.<br />One possile explanation is that pigeonpeas growing on Vertisols are adversely affected by the large cracks which develop as the soil dries out after the end of the monsoon (Sheldrake and Venkataratnam, 1982). Such cracks do not appear in Alfisols. The cracks could damage the plants directly by stretching and rupturing roots, and indirectly through providing a larger surface area for evaporation from the soil.<br />The poor, and even negative, response to irrigation on Vertisol may also be related to soil cracking. By the time the irrigation was given, in December<br /><br />329<br />or January (Table 1), deep cracks had already developed. After irrigation the soil swelled again, and the cracks closed up. It is possible that the swelling of the soil caused further damage by stretching the roots. This negative effect would no doubt have been offset to some extent by the beneficial effect of a greater availability of water in the soft, but it may well explain why the large increases due to irrigation obtained on Alfisols, were not obtained on Vertisols.<br />Effects of ratooning on Vertisols<br />By contrast with the results on Alfisols, where ratooned plants gave considerably lower yields than non-ratooned plants, on Vertisols there was no such clear-cut pattern. In some experiments ratooned plants yielded less than non-ratooned plants, and in others more (Table 3). The variation in results from year to year may reflect both the different climatic conditions (Table 2) and the fact that different fields were used. In 1976--77, growth was generally poor in the particular field used for this experiment, and the plants showed toxicity symptoms, probably due to boron. In 1977--78, when second harvest yields were high, the plants were grown in a field next to a lake, with a high water table.<br />Plants ratooned at 45 or 30 cm yielded only between half and two-thirds as much as ones ratooned at 90 cm, and those cut back to 10 cm gave extremely low second harvest yields (Fig. 1).<br /><br />700.<br />60O %~ 500<br />=~ C°o 300<br /><br />1976-77 . . . . . . . . 48 an~ AS-71-37 (means}<br /><br />1977-78<br />cv.

Effect of height of ratooning on second harvest grain yield (kg/ha) o f medium duration pigeonpeas grown on Vertisol.<br /><br />330<br /><br />The yield reductions due to ratooning closer to the ground were due in part to the greater mortality of the plants and in part to the greater delay in the development of the second flush of pods. The nearer to the ground the plants were cut, the more vegetative regrowth took place before flowering began on the new shoots, and the later the second flush of pods matured. As on Alfisols, such delays exposed the plants to increasing water stress.<br />An additional reason why the plants yielded the less the more severely they were ratooned may be that greater amounts of stem were removed, and the plants were therefore deprived of any reserves of nutrients and assimilates which may have been stored within the stems.<br />Whatever the relative importance of the different reasons for yield reductions, it is clear that the higher second harvest yields were obtained either from plants that were not ratooned at all, or from those ratooned furthest away from the ground. Similar results have been described by Suarez and Herreara (1971).<br /><br />The harvest of both flushes of pods at the same time<br /><br />The first flush of pods can simply be left on the plants at the time the first harvest is normally taken. The second flush then develops on the same plants, and both can then be harvested at the same time, around March. We compared the yield harvested in this way with the total yield obtained by taking first and second harvests separately from non-ratooned plants. In 1977--78, the yield with a single harvest was lower by 27% in the nonirrigated plants, and by 22% in the irrigated plants (Table 5). A major reason for this lower yield was the shattering of the pods from the first flush.<br />In 1978--79, the yield obtained from a single harvest was similar to that obtained by harvesting the first and second flushes separately (Table 5), and<br /><br />TABLE 5<br /><br />Total grain yield obtained from the first and second harvests from non-ratooned pigeonpeas (cv.

One reason for the difference between this and the previous year may have been that there were showers in both January and February in 1978, but only in February in 1979 (Table 2) and the more repeated wetting and drying of the mature pods in 1978 may have caused more of them to shatter. In situations in which there is a low probability of rainfall between the times of maturity of the first and second flushes of pods, or where cultivars selected for relatively shatter-resistant pods are used, the yield losses by taking a single harvest might be small, and more than offset by the savings in time and expenditure by eliminating the first harvest.<br />CONCLUSIONS<br />The most surprising aspect of our results is that second harvest yields of medium duration pigeonpeas were generally better on Alfisols than Vertisols. Although experiments were carried out only at one location, they suggest that the agronomic potential for obtaining additional yields by taking a second harvest on Vertisols is limited, but on Alfisols may be considerable, especially if there is a posiibility of giving an irrigation to the crop after the first harvest.<br />Higher yields are obtained on Alfisols if the first harvest is taken by podpicking, rather than ratooning; but pod-picking is more time-consuming and expensive. If the plants are ratooned, then the results of the experiments on Vertisol (Fig. 1) suggest that it would be best to ratoon them as high as possible. In circumstances where the mature first flush of pods is not likely to be eaten by animals or stolen, and where the probability of rainfall is low, it may be economically advantageous to eliminate the first harvest altogether and harvest both first and second flushes of pods together.<br />Most medium duration pigeonpeas in peninsular India are intercropped with other crop species (Willey et al., 1981), and if the pigeonpea population is low it may not be economically worthwhile to take a second harvest from the plants. However, in developing and improving cropping systems involving pigeonpea, it may well be possible to devise systems which enable the second harvest potential to be exploited at little extra cost.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>; <p>References: Pathak, Red gram (1970) Pulse Crops of India, , Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi; <br/>Reddy, Virmani, Pigeonpea and its climatic environment (1981) ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics), Proceedings of the International Workshop on Pigeonpeas, 15–19 December 1980, Patancheru, India, 1, pp. 259-290;<br/>Sharma, Saxena, Green, Potential of ratooning in pigeonpea (1978) Field Crops Res., 1, pp. 165-172;<br/>Sheldrake, A hydrodynamical model of pod-set in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (1979) Indian J.

However, the plants ratooned at 30 cm performed best followed by those ratooned at 60 om. The total seed yield from the planting was 3-6 times higher than if the crop had been harvested once.<br />It would seem that ratooning at 30 cm would give the highest returns from a single planting under the prevailing lowland tropical conditions.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />Under the traditional mixed cropping systems of the lowland tropics, pigeon pea, a perennial crop, is adapted to growing for two or more seasons. The development of early-maturing, dwarf varieties suited to sole cropping has shifted the emphasis from perennial to annual growth. Exploiting the perennial nature of pigeon pea to reap two or more harvests from the same crop would lead to a more efficient utilization of available land space.<br />It has been demonstrated that considerable vegetative regrowth occurs when pigeon pea is ratooned (cutting the plant off above the branching level) at first pod maturity and when the subsequent seed crop is harvested (Killinger, 1968; Sharma, Saxena &amp; Green, 1978). In fact, a three-harvest orop has been reported for certain cultivars of pigeon pea (Anon. 1984).<br />The object of the study reported here was to evaluate the extent to which ratooning could lead to more than one harvest of seeds from a single crop, in a mono-culture, under the prevailing lowland tropical conditions.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Seeds of a dwarf variety of pigeon pea (variety Cita-1) were sown on ridges 0-75 m apart with an<br /><br />interplant spacing of 0-2 m to give a seed rate of 66 000/ha in two trials on the University of Ibadan Farm in 1983 on a sandy loam soil derived from metamorphic and igneous rocks. Ridging at a height of 0-25 m was done 2 weeks before sowing on 27 April (early planting) and 7 July 1983 (late planting) in a randomized complete block design.<br />Two to three weeks after the plants had reached maturity and the pods harvested, by hand-picking, the plants were either ratooned by cutting off the tops at a height of 30 and 60 cm or left intact. The plot size for each treatment was 12 x 8 m in both plantings. The plants were left to regenerate and develop new pods. At the second maturity, the plants were evaluated for growth and yield characteristics after which the pods on them were removed by hand and the plants (without any cutting back) left to develop another set of pods. When the third set of pods matured, the plants were again sampled for evaluation of dry-matter distribution and yield characteristics in the various treatments.<br />The plots were kept weed-free regularly; no supplemental irrigation was carried out but the plants were sprayed twice (at an interval of one week) at the beginning of eachfloweringcycle using Nuvaoron 40EC at a rate of 4-0 ml/1 of water to control the insects prevalent on the crop at that time.<br /><br />590 T. 0.

Following an unusual amount of precipitation in December 1983 (about 50 mm), the plants ratooned at a height of 30 and 60 om developed vigorous axillary branches and in the case of those ratooned at 30 cm, the most distal branch eventually took over as the main stem and was subsequently so considered. The top 30-45 cm of the main stem in the intact plants died off so that small new leaves were produced from the branches while the old leaves dropped off intermittently.<br /><br />(Table 1). The plants ratooned at 30 cm developed signifi-<br />cantly more seed-bearing pods, higher pod, seed and husk dry weights, more seeds per plant and per pod and greater seed yield than the intact plants and those ratooned at 60 cm, at both plantings. Although the plants ratooned at 60 cm had higher values of these attributes than the intaot plants at both plantings, the differences were not significant. In the early planting, the ratooned plants also had significantly higher values of dry weight per pod, seed weight per pod and seed to husk ratio than the intact plants (Table 2).<br /><br />The plants ratooned at 30 and 60 cm from the early planting flowered earlier and reached maturity Second regrowth<br /><br />(42 weeks after sowing) 5-6 weeks before the intact The dry-matter accumulation at the end of the<br /><br />plants.

However, the oumulative seed yield was highest from the plots ratooned at 30 cm (10 t/ha), intermediate in those ratooned at 60 cm (7 t/ha) and least in the intact plants (6 t/ha). This was also true of all yield characters that were cumulative over the period (Table 5). The first seed yield averaged 1-9 t/ha at both plantings.<br />The average number of seeds per pod, the average 100-seed weight, the average dry weight per pod and the average seed weight per pod deoreased as the cycle of pod production increased with early planting whereas the reverse was the case at the late planting (Table 5).<br />DISCUSSION<br />Ratooning the dwarf variety of pigeon pea or allowing undisturbed growth in a mono-culture after harvesting the first set of pods led to renewed vegetative development, resulting in a second and third harvest of pods from the same planting within a year. This shows that pigeon pea can be cultivated as a multiple-harvest crop in a mono-culture under the prevailing lowland tropical conditions as has been reported in other regions ofthe world (Killinger, 1968; Anon. 1984).<br />Cutting the plant back to a height of 30 cm was the most beneficial to vegetative regrowth and subsequent seed yield because the vigorous new<br /><br />branches that developed on the stump bore new leaves which were possibly photosynthetically more active than the older leaves on the plants left intact or ratooned at 60 cm. It would be noted that the differences in the seed yields of the various treatments were smaller in the second regrowth when the ratooned plants were no longer cut back.<br />The delay in reaching maturity by the intact plants of the early planting at the first regrowth was possibly due to the fact that ratooning stimulates a quicker regeneration of vegetative growth and flowering than in intact plants. It has been shown that the success of a ratooned crop depends on soil moisture supply, the regenerative ability of the cultivar grown as well as the maturity period (Sharma et al. 1978; Narayanan, Murthy &amp; Khader, 1980). The unusual rainfall in December 1983 meant that the residual soil moisture was higher than normal during this study.<br />The average values of certain yield characters (100-seed weight, number of seeds per pod, dry weight per pod, seed weight perpod) decreased with increasing cycles of pod production following early planting but increased in the case of late planting, thus indicating that the initial average values with late planting were below optimum. This low initial average value at late planting could be due to the reduced plant size which has been shown to be characteristic of late planting when soil moisture is reduced (Tayo, 1985). Later on, the prevailing environmental conditions affected both plantings equally in the development ofthese yield characters.<br />It would seem from the results of this study that<br /><br />Ratooning of pigeon pea<br /><br />593<br /><br />ratooning pigeon pea leads to significantly higher seed yield than harvesting once and cutting the main stem back to 30 cm is the best form of ratooning under the prevailing lowland tropical conditions.<br /><br />The author is grateful for the support of the University of Ibadan Senate Research Grant and the technical assistance of Mr J.

Field Crops Res., 1: 165--172.<br />Yield trials of pigeonpea cultivars grouped into early, medium, and late maturity were harvested for grain at maturity by ratooning (cutting the plants off above the branching level). Plant survival after ratooning and regrowth varied among cultivars in all tests. First harvest of early cultivars was affected by high pod-borer damage, and the second grain crop was equal to the first on average; medium cultivars produced a second crop approximately 50% of the first, and late cultivars produced no grain after the first harvest.<br />Indications of cultivar differences for survival and regeneration after ratooning suggest the possibility of effective selection for these characteristics.<br />Results presented are from deep black soils in a year of unusually heavy rainfall; the authors recognize the limitations of the data, but believe that the potential for taking a second crop merits further investigation.<br />A p p r o x i m a t e l y three million hectares of pigeonpeas (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) are grown for food production in semi-arid tropical areas and are harvested for dry grain on the majority of the acreage grown. Cutting the stems at the base and drying the entire plants before threshing is the usual practice, with only minor exception in areas where plants are cut above the branching level to permit vegetative regrowth for grazing. With the crop maturing on residual moisture in the dry season, and the harvest preceding the resumption of the rains by up to six months or more, properly ratooned plants have the potential for producing a second grain crop, or at least proriding much-needed forage during the interim period. Success of the ratooned crop will depend on soil moisture supply, regenerative ability of the cultivar grown, and maturity period. It has been observed that in early and medium maturing cultivars, regenerated growth after the first grain harvest develops flowers and pods quickly, whereas in late cultivars new growth is mainly vegetative.<br />It is the purpose of this paper to report observations on cultivars with a<br />*Plant Breeder (S-4), Plant Breeder (S-1), and Leader pulse improvement program.<br /><br />166<br />wide range of maturity, and to call attention to the potential value of ratooning as a general practice in pigeonpea agronomy.<br />Experimental data on the ratoonability and grain yield potential of cultivats of different maturity are lacking. The possibility of harvesting substantial forage and a subsequent seed crop has been indicated by Killinger (1968) in Florida. Sharma {unpublished) observed that a good forage and a grain crop could be harvested by planting the variety No.148 in the first week of July at 30-cm row-to-row and 10-cm plant-to-plant spacing in the deep black soils of Jabalpur (M.P., India). A forage crop was harvested in the third week of September by cutting at 45 cm above the ground. The regenerated growth yielded 1200 kg/ha of grain harvested in the last week of February. The value of pigeonpeas as a forage crop and harvesting of green fodder by repeated cuts has been well documented and reviewed by Akinola et al. {1975). In addition, Akinola and Whiteman (1975) studied two early and two late maturing varieties for dry matter and nitrogen yield under different ""defoliation"" (ratooning) treatments. They observed that 8- and 12-week ""defoliation"" frequencies could be successfully integrated to incorporate cattle grazing and forage and seed production into a single management system.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS<br />All India Coordinated varietal tests representing three maturity groups -ACT-1 (7 early cultivars, maturing in 160 d); ACT-2 (15 medium cultivars, maturing in 160--200 d); and ACT-3 (20 late cultivars, maturing in more than 200 d) -- were conducted during the rainy season of 1975 at ICRISAT. All three tests were carried out on deep black soil in 5-m-long rows. In ACT-1 the distance between the rows and within the row was 50 cm and 25 cm, respectively, while ACT-2 and ACT-3 were planted on ridges 75 cm apart with 30-cm plant-to-plant spacing. Eight rows were planted per plot in four replicates in ACT-1 and ACT-3, and three in Act-2. Net plot size was 14.4 m 2 in ACT-1 and 21.6 m2 in ACT-2 and ACT-3. All the trials were planted on 30 June 1975. Fertilizer at the rate of 18 kg N and 46 kg P/ha was applied before planting. Rainfall for the year was above normal, 1053.3 mm compared with an average of 760 mm. All the cultivars were harvested at first grain maturity by cutting at 30--40 cm above the lower most pod bearing branch. Days to first harvest were taken from the date of planting to 75?0 pod maturity. The ratooned plants were allowed to grow without any additional fertilizer or irrigation. The regenerated growth was first graded on a scale of 1--5 (one being the best) at 35 d in Act-2 and ACT-3 and again at 60 d in the latter. Living plant counts were taken after each harvest. The yield data were analyzed as a split-plot design with harvest time (first and ratoon crop) as main plots, and cultivars as sub-plots. The seeds from both harvests were analyzed for nitrogen by a 'Technicon Auto Analyzer' to compare protein levels (N X 6.25) of the grain from the first and the ratooned crop. Since differences in plant stand at the time of first harvest were not significant and incidence<br /><br />167<br /><br />of the wilt disease (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. udum) was a major factor affecting yield of the ratoon crop, yields were not adjusted for stand.<br /><br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br /><br />Among the early varieties, days to maturity ranged from 130.8 to 151.3 (Table I). The average production of the seven cultivars was essentially the same for first and second harvest, with no significant difference between harvest and no significant interaction of cultivars × harvest (Table II). The earliest cultivar gave the highest ratoon yield in terms of percentage of first harvest; this reflects the extremely low yield of the first harvest. Regenerated growth in early cultivars coincided with cooler temperature, which delayed the earlier genotypes so that all entries matured together with the onset of high temperature.<br />Seed production by this group in the first harvest approximated world average production; by taking a ratoon crop it was doubled. Grain production was 4.34 kg/ha/d for the first crop; for the ratoon crop 4.90 kg/ha/d, and over both crops 4.60 kg/ha/d.<br />""Medium"" maturity cultivars in ACT-2 produced roughly double the grain yield of the early group, but the ratoon yield was only 50% of the first harvest. Days to first harvest ranged from 142.3 to 204.0, and it appears that the extreme cultivars should not have been included in this group (Table III). However, for present purposes (which are to study ratooning, rather than to compare cultivars on one year's data), using the averages of the group, grain production of the first crop was 7.38 kg/ha/d; for the ratoon<br /><br />TABLE I<br /><br />Days to harvest, grain yield and seed protein content (%) of cultivars in first and the ratoon crop in ACT-1<br /><br />Cultivar<br /><br />Yield (kg/ha)<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />Total<br /><br />Days to harvest<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />Total<br /><br />Protein (%)<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />BS-1 T-21 Pusa-<br />4-84 HPA-1 DL-74-1 BR-172 HY-1<br /><br />297.9 541.7 640.6 654.5<br /><br />718.5 505.2 534.7 791.6 784.7<br /><br />569.4 500.0 574.7 625.0 668.4<br /><br />838.6 1295.1<br />1287.9 1005.2 1109.4 1416.6 1453.1<br /><br />130.8 130.2 136.0 125.0<br /><br />138.5 140.3 142.8 144.3 151.3<br /><br />122.5 120.7 118.2 116.7 109.7<br /><br />261.0 20.8 261.0 21.0<br /><br />261.0 261.0 261.0 261.0 261.0<br /><br />22.1 21.6 21.4 21.6 21.4<br /><br />22.7 23.6<br />23.7 23.2 23.9 23.0 22.5<br /><br />Mean<br /><br />610.47 590.52<br /><br />1200.85 140.6 --<br /><br />-- 21.40 23.23<br /><br />LSD at 5% for comparison of cultivar yield = 204.95.

Within trial ACT-2 the interaction of cultivars X harvests was significant,<br />while the main effects were highly significant (Table II). The incidence of Fusarium wilt was important in this test but not in ACT-I; percentages of plants surviving at the time of the two harvests are shown in Table V. Plant<br />death resulted from attack by wilt and from other causes; these were not separated in the counts taken. Survival in different varieties after ratooning ranged from 54.69 to 97.08% and differences were highly significant. Resistance to wilt as well as inherent regenerative ability are both essential in a cultivar for good ratoonability.<br />Within the medium maturity group, where cultivar X harvests was significant, the ratoon crop yield was significantly correlated only with percentage survival of plants after harvest (r = 0.64""*). Inclusion of other independent variables (viz., days to flower in the first crop, days to maturity in the first crop, and first crop yield) did not substantially improve the relationship (r = 0.70**).<br />The late cultivars in trial ACT-3 were ready for the first harvest 238 d after planting. At 17°N latitude, these cultivars produce only vegetative growth after ratooning. The average seed yield of the test was 1670 kg/ha, and the rate of production was 7.02 kg/ha/d. Entries were scored visually for forage production (Table IV), and the differences among cultivars were highly significant. Selection of cultivars for good ratoonability in the areas where late maturity types are best adapted (where some farmers already ratoon for post-harvest grazing) can increase the value of the crop.<br /><br />TABLE III<br /><br />Days to harvest, grain yield and seed protein content (%) of cultivars in first and ratoon crop in ACT-2<br /><br />Cultivar<br /><br />Yield (kg/ha)<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />Total<br /><br />Days to harvest<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />Total<br /><br />Protein (%)<br /><br />First crop<br /><br />Ratoon crop<br /><br />Visual scoring on ratooning<br /><br />PS-11 HY-4 EB-3870 HY-2 Mukta No. 148 PM-1 BDN-1 AS-71-37 ICRISAT-1 JA-3 ICRISAT-<br />6997 ST-1 SA-1 C-11<br /><br />703.7 1088.0 1111.1 1388.9 1250.0 1304.0 1072.5 1466.0 1504.6 1134.3 1188.3<br />1302.5 1365.7 1350.2 1929.0<br /><br />336.4 430.6 717.6 300.9 657.4 838.0 488.1 898.1 967.6 578.7 976.9<br />583.3 740.7 382.7 702.2<br /><br />1040.1 1518.6 1828.7 1689.8 1907.4 2142.0 1560.6 2364.1 2472.2 1713.0 2165.2<br />1885.8 2106.4 1732.9 2631.2<br /><br />142.3 160.3 162.6 163.3 164.0 167.7 173.0 173.3 176.7 177.0 177.0<br /><br />127.7 119.7 126.4 125.7 125.0 121.3 116.0 115.7 112.3 112.0 112.0<br /><br />178.3 185.3 191.3 204.0<br /><br />108.7 103.7<br />99.7 105.0<br /><br />270 23.8 21.3 280 21.0 20.5 289 22.0 21.4 289 21.3 21.2 289 22.2 21.3 289 22.1 21.7 289 21.4 21.6 289 22.6 21.5 289 21.7 21.0 289 21.4 21.3 289 21.6 21.4<br />287 22.0 19.8 289 22.0 22.4 291 22.2 21.7 309 22.5 20.3<br /><br />3.7 3.7 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.3 3.5 1.0 2.3 3.0 1.5<br />3.6 3.3 3.8 3.0<br /><br />Mean<br /><br />1277.3<br /><br />639.9<br /><br />1917.2<br /><br />173.0 --<br /><br />288.5 21.99 19.8<br /><br />LSD at 5% for comparison of harvest time mean yield<br /><br />= 531.09.<br /><br />LSD at 5% for comparison of cultivar yield<br /><br />= 262.78.<br /><br />LSD at 5% for comparison of cultivar yield within a harvest time = 371.62.<br /><br />LSD at 5% for comparison a cultivar yield at different harvest time = 596.95.<br /><br />TABLE IV<br /><br />Visual scores for vegetative growth after ratooning in ACT-3<br /><br />Cultivar<br /><br />35 d after ratooning<br /><br />60 d after ratooning<br /><br />Mean Range<br /><br />Mean<br /><br />Range<br /><br />T-7 4.0 3--5<br /><br />NP(WR)-15<br /><br />4.0 4<br /><br />B-517<br /><br />4.3 4--5<br /><br />1258<br /><br />4.8 4--5<br /><br />1234<br /><br />4.0 4<br /><br />Gwalior-3<br /><br />2.5 2--3<br /><br />KWR-1<br /><br />5.0 5<br /><br />GC-6826-5<br /><br />4.0 3--5<br /><br />GC-6800-67<br /><br />3.3 3--4<br /><br />GC-6842-9<br /><br />4.0 4<br /><br />AS-44<br /><br />3.8 3--5<br /><br />K-16<br /><br />3.3 3--4<br /><br />K-23<br /><br />4.3 4--5<br /><br />PS-43<br /><br />4.5 4--5<br /><br />PS-65<br /><br />4.0 3--5<br /><br />PS-66<br /><br />3.8 3--4<br /><br />PS-71<br /><br />5.0 5<br /><br />PS-41<br /><br />3.5 2--5<br /><br />ICRISAT-7065 2.8 2--3<br /><br />ICRISAT-7086 4.0 3--5<br /><br />3.5 3--4 3.3 3--4 4.0 3--5 4.5 4--5 3.8 3--4 2.3 1--3 4.3 3--5 3.8 3--5 3.0 3 4.0 3--4 3.8 3--5 2.8 2--3 3.5 3--5 4.3 4--5 4.5 3--5 4.3 4--5 4.8 4--5 3.0 2--4 2.3 2--3 3.3 3--4<br /><br />TABLE V<br /><br />Survival of plants (%) at the time of first and ratoon crop harvest in ACT-2<br /><br />Cultivar<br /><br />Rep.I<br /><br />Rep.II<br /><br />Rep.

SEm± = 6.56.<br /><br />171<br /><br />BREEDING FOR RATOONABILITY<br />Varietal differences for ratoonability in terms of grain yield in ACT-2 and in terms of regenerated forage in ACT-3 were quite distinct, and since they were not correlated with the main crop yield it would be desirable to select varieties which have good main crop yield as well as good ratoonability. The high correlation of visual scores (Table III) with ratoon yield (r = -0.87**) indicates the possibility of effective selection in non-replicated material. However, when ratoonability of the varieties over the two tests ACT-1 and ACT-2, in terms of ratooned yield as a percentage of the first harvest (ratoonability index), was measured, it appeared to be negatively correlated with days to first harvest (Fig.l). High ratoonability index of the early varieties in ACT-1 was a result of very low first harvest yields. There was heavy damage by pod borers to the earliest culfivars. Though the ratoonability index of the early varieties was very high, the total grain harvest from the first and the ratooned crop was invariably much more in the medium duration varieties than in any early variety.<br /><br />200""<br />180 -<br />~ 0.<br />u.

The 100-seed weight (g/100 seeds) from the first and ratoon crop harvest was 7.89 and 7.62 in ACT-l, and 9.86 and 9.43 in ACT-2, respectively. The difference between harvests was not significant.<br />ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br />The contribution of the All India Coordinated Pulse Improvement Program, coordinator Prof. S.
