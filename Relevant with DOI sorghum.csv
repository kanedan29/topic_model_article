Rhizomes and perenniality are considered primitive and fundamentally related traits in monocots and grasses (Dahlgren et&nbsp;al. 1985), but these traits are absent in annual grass species, such as wheat, rice, maize, and other major cereal crops. Genes controlling rhizomes and perennial growth habit could be used to extend the vegetative life cycle of cereal crops (Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995; Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003), promoting sustainable food production and ecosystem security (Cox et&nbsp;al. 2002, 2006; Glover et&nbsp;al. 2010). Moreover, rhizomes help perennial grasses recover from grazing (Briske 1996), fire (Choczynska and Johnson<br /><br />13<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 84 Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397<br /><br />2009), flooding (Mahelka 2006) and other environmental hazards. Rhizomes also provide a commercially important means of propagation for perennial forage, turf, and bioenergy grasses (Agnew and Christians 1992; Hanna and Anderson 2008; Mann et&nbsp;al. 2013). However, the aggressive rhizomes of perennial grass weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens) or johnsongrass (Sorghum haplense) can be invasive (Holm et&nbsp;al. 1977; Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995; Taylor et&nbsp;al. 1995; Mann et&nbsp;al. 2013). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome development, including the dominant-effect Rhz2 and Rhz3 ortholoci, have been identified using crosses of annual and perennial species of rice, Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003), and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum (Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995). Although rhizomatous hybrids of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and perennial wheatgrass (Thinopyrum spp.) or perennial wildrye (Leymus spp.) have also been described (Cox et&nbsp;al. 2002), the lack of homologous chromosome pairing in wheat-Leymus and wheat-Thinopyrum hybrids hinders genetic elucidation of perennial rhizome traits in these grasses. Thus, genes controlling rhizome proliferation in grasses are strategically important targets for breeding perennial cereal crops, improving forage and turf grasses, and controlling the invasiveness of perennial grass weeds. However, genetic mechanisms controlling rhizomes have not been fully elucidated in any plant and other experimental systems are needed to elucidate the genetic control of rhizome development in perennial relatives of wheat, which include important forage grasses and highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass.<br />The architecture of stem branching in perennial grasses is often categorized as caespitose, rhizomatous, or stoloniferous (Harrington 1977; Gibson 2009), and the extent of rhizomatous or stoloniferous spreading can vary greatly among different species. The stems of caespitose perennial grasses grow upright in tufts or close clusters, with each stem originating from an axillary bud at the base of the plant. Conversely, the basal axillary buds of stoloniferous and rhizomatous grasses produce axes that grow more or less horizontally above or below the ground surface, respectively. External cues that determine developmental differences between the upright stems of caespitose grasses, prostrate stolons, and subterranean rhizomes likely involve different responses to gravity and light (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b). Although the direction of growth in axillary meristems is primarily determined by gravity, it may also respond to light (Hangarter 1997), which may explain differences between species that have above-ground stolons or subterranean rhizomes (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b). In addition to external cues, hormonally controlled apical dominance also regulates the growth of rhizomes (Taylor et&nbsp;al. 1995; Domagalska and Leyser 2011).<br /><br />Gravity and light are perceived by very different and well-defined molecular mechanisms (Morita 2010; Hashiguchi et&nbsp;al. 2013; Hohm et&nbsp;al. 2013; Yoshihara et&nbsp;al. 2013). However, gravitropism, phototropism, and the general pattern of axis formation and branch development are all mediated by similar mechanisms of polar auxin transport, auxin perception, auxin signaling, and auxin response (De Smet and Jürgens 2007; Hohm et&nbsp;al. 2013; Spalding 2013), which also interact with other plant hormones (Vandenbussche et&nbsp;al. 2013) to maintain apical dominance (Taylor et&nbsp;al. 1995; Domagalska and Leyser 2011). Auxin signaling depends on AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcriptional activators, which are inhibited by AUXIN INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) inducible proteins (Hagen and Guilfoyle 2002; Liscum and Reed 2002; Teale et&nbsp;al. 2006). The Aux/IAA and ARF gene families of dicots (Liscum and Reed 2002; Remington et&nbsp;al. 2004; Wu et&nbsp;al. 2012) and monocots (Jain et&nbsp;al. 2006; Song et&nbsp;al. 2009; Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010a, b, 2012) are each composed of about 20–30 genes, which create a network of many possible interactions (Vernoux et&nbsp;al. 2011) necessary for a wide diversity of auxin responses (Sauer et&nbsp;al. 2013). Thus, the Aux/IAA and ARF genes have diverse roles throughout plant development, including special functions in gravitropism, phototropism, and apical dominance (Liscum and Reed 2002; Weijers et&nbsp;al. 2005; De Smet and Jürgens 2007; Hohm et&nbsp;al. 2013; Vandenbussche et&nbsp;al. 2013).<br />The Triticeae tribe contains about 400-500 temperate grass species, including wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale) (Barkworth 2007). The Triticeae genus Leymus is composed of about 50 perennial wildrye species distributed throughout temperate regions of the world (Barkworth 2007), including caespitose basin wildrye (Leymus cinereus) and rhizomatous creeping wildrye (L. triticoides) of western North America. Genetic maps for two pseudo-backcross mapping populations, TTC1 and TTC2, derived from one creeping wildrye plant pollinated by two creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids were developed using expressed sequence tag (EST) markers from rhizome meristems (Wu et&nbsp;al. 2003; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012). Three consensus QTLs controlling the perimeter of rhizome spreading were detected on linkage groups (LG)-3a, -3b, and -6a in both TTC1 and TTC2 populations (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013). Alignments of the LG-3a, -3b, and -6a perennial wildrye rhizome QTLs to the rice and Brachypodium genome sequences (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008a; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013) revealed possible correspondence to the wheat tiller inhibition3 (Kuraparthy et&nbsp;al. 2008), maize barren stalk1 (Komatsu et&nbsp;al. 2003; Gallavotti et&nbsp;al. 2004), and barley uniculm1 (Babb and Muehlbauer 2003) mutations, respectively, but no QTLs corresponding to the dominant Rhz2 or Rhz3 orthogenes of rice and sorghum (Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995; Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003). However, previous genetic models<br /><br />13<br /><br />Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />385<br /><br />of rhizome development in perennial wildrye (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006, 2013) may be incomplete because dominant creeping wildrye rhizome QTL alleles (i.e., recessive basin wildrye QTL alleles) might not have been detectable in the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations.<br />The primary objective of this study was to map QTLs controlling the perimeter of rhizome spreading in a basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population that is reciprocal to the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations used in previous rhizome QTL studies (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006, 2013). Comparisons of QTL results between the reciprocal pseudo-backcross populations were used to discern additive, dominant, or recessive rhizome gene effects based on the premise that dominant creeping wildrye rhizome gene effects should be detectable in the basin wildrye backcross, dominant basin wildrye gene effects (i.e., recessive creeping wildrye rhizome gene effects) should be detectable in the creeping wildrye backcross, and additive gene effects should be detectable in both basin wildrye and creeping wildrye backcrosses. A dominant rhizome QTL detected only in the new basin wildrye pseudo-backcross mapping population was aligned to the Rhz3 orthogene of perennial rice and perennial sorghum based on alignments to the Brachypodium genome reference sequence. An additive-effect QTL with relatively high LOD values in the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross was localized to a 3.8-cM region on the distal end of LG-6a, which corresponded to 106 Brachypodium genes, including an Aux/IAA locus and other possible candidate genes. Moreover, an expressed gene sequence marker derived from the perennial wildrye Aux/IAA gene cosegregated with the 31.6-LOD rhizome QTL peak. These results elucidate the genetic control of rhizome development and provide a useful experimental system to identify genes controlling rhizome proliferation in species that are closely-related to wheat and quackgrass.<br />Materials and&nbsp;methods<br />Plant materials<br />All plant materials derive from controlled crosses involving selected individuals of basin wildrye (Leymus cinereus) accession Acc:636 collected near Lethbridge, Alberta and selected individuals of creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) accession Acc:641 collected near Jamieson, Oregon (Supplemental Figure S1). Previously described creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (TTC1 and TTC2), composed of 164 and 170 full-sib genotypes, were derived from one creeping wildrye Acc:641 plant (T-tester) pollinated by two different creeping wildrye Acc:641&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye Acc:636 hybrid plants (TC1 and TC2) as described by Wu et&nbsp;al. (2003). The new basin wildrye<br /><br />pseudo-backcross population (TCC), composed of 250 fullsib genotypes, was derived from one basin wildrye Acc:636 plant (C-tester) pollinated by the same creeping wildrye Acc:641&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye Acc:636 hybrid plant (TC1) used to make the TTC1 population. The “T” and “C” abbreviations correspond to the creeping and basin wildrye species epithets (L. triticoides and L. cinereus), respectively. The full-sib TTC1, TTC2, and TCC families are referred to as pseudo-backcross populations because the T-tester and C-tester parents are not the exact same plants used to make the TC1 or TC2 hybrid plants. Progeny and parents of the TCC mapping populations, including the TC1 hybrid and C-tester genotypes, were vegetatively propagated for field evaluations described herein and will be clonally maintained for an indefinite period.<br />Molecular genetic markers<br />An expressed gene sequence tag (EST) library prepared from rhizome meristems of the perennial wildrye TC1 and TC2 hybrids was used to design 1,798 EST simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers designated Ltc0001– Ltc1798 (Bushman et&nbsp;al. 2008) and 69 primer pairs for the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of 39 lignin biosynthesis EST unigenes (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012). All of these perennial wildrye EST sequences have been aligned to genome sequences of Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012) and can be found in the corresponding Biofuel Feedstock Genomics Resource (BFGR) genome browsers (Childs et&nbsp;al. 2012), the W.M. Keck Center Triticeae EST website (http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/triticeae/), and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Herein, another 211 new PCR markers were designed from 3′ UTRs of other perennial wildrye ESTs with predicted locations on the long arm of homoeologous Group 6, with designated prefix LG6L, based on alignments to Brachypodium Chromosome 3 and rice Chromosome 2. Additional perennial wildrye EST primers were also designed from an ortholog of the rice Chromosome-4 Ra gene (Hu et&nbsp;al. 1996) with predicted map location on perennial wildrye homoeologous Group 2. Heterologous PCR primers were designed from the barley Chromosome-6L MLOC_65332 IAA10 ortholog of the Brachypodium Chromosome-3 BRADIG55410 and Oryza sativa Chromosome-2 LOC_ Os02g57250 IAA10 orthogene (Jain et&nbsp;al. 2006), which were found using genome sequences of Brachypodium (The International Brachypodium Initiative 2010), barley (The International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium 2012), and rice (The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005) based on genome alignments in Gramene (Ware et&nbsp;al. 2002) and BFGR (Childs et&nbsp;al. 2012). Primer sequences and public data sources for all new perennial wildrye EST markers not previously described by Bushman<br /><br />13<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;386 Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397<br /><br />et&nbsp;al. (2008) or Larson et&nbsp;al. (2012) are provided in Supplementary Table S1.<br />The TCC population was also genotyped using 16 of the 21 most informative EcoRI-MseI AFLP primer combinations (E36M49, E36M61, E36M62, E37M47, E37M60, E37M62, E38M47, E38M49, E38M59, E38M60, E41M47, E41M48, E41M49, E41M60, E41M61, and E41M62) used in the reciprocal TTC1 and TTC2 creeping wildrye pseudobackcross populations (Wu et&nbsp;al. 2003). The AFLP reactions were performed as described by Vos et&nbsp;al. (1995), except that the EcoRI selective amplification primers were labeled using fluorescent 6-FAM (6-carboxy fluorescein) on the 5′ nucleotides as described by Wu et&nbsp;al. (2003).<br />The relative mobility of all PCR amplification products, including EST and AFLP markers, was analyzed using Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) ABI 3730 capillary electrophoresis instruments using GeneScan (Applied Biosystems) 500 LIZ size standards and software.<br />Cloning and&nbsp;sequencing of&nbsp;the IAA10 gene and&nbsp;transcript<br />Transcripts of the IAA10 gene were amplified from cDNA prepared from rhizome meristems of the creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b), using the IAA10 and IAA10-EXN-2-4 PCR primers (Supplementary Table S1). The IAA10 genomic DNA and cDNA amplicons were cloned using the Life Technologies TA Cloning Kit (Grand Island, New York) and sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye terminator v3.1 cycle-sequencing reactions, Edge-Biosystems (Gaithersberg, Maryland) ExcelaPure purification columns, and the Applied Biosystems 3730 capillary electrophoresis instruments.<br />Genetic map construction<br />The TCC population was genotyped for 411 AFLP loci and 112 EST markers (Table&nbsp;1) that were present in the hybrids, absent in the C-tester, and segregating among the 250 TCC progeny. The majority of polymorphic markers in the TCC mapping population came from the creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye TC1 hybrid, but other polymorphic markers that came from the basin wildrye C-tester genotype were not scored because these markers could not be associated with differences between species. A subset of 46 AFLP markers and 48 EST markers scored in the TCC population were suspected to be orthologous to previously mapped TTC1 or TTC2 markers (Wu et&nbsp;al. 2003; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012) based on amplicon size, linkage phase, or EST identity (Table&nbsp;1). A linkage map for TC1 markers that segregated in the TCC population was determined using the doubled haploid (DH) model of JoinMap Version 4 (Van Ooijen 2006). Linkage groups (LGs) were initially determined with a minimum LOD linkage threshold of 10 using the TTC consensus map<br /><br />(Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012) and perennial wildrye EST alignments to other grass genome reference sequences (Bushman et&nbsp;al. 2008; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012) as a guide to separate orthologous TCC markers into 14 LGs corresponding to the 14 homologous chromosome pairs of these allotetraploid (2n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4x&nbsp;=&nbsp;28) species (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012). Thus, the 14 LGs of the new TCC consensus map were numbered and aligned according to the 14 LGs of the TTC1 and TTC2 consensus map (Table&nbsp;1) and the seven homoeologous Chromosomes (x&nbsp; =&nbsp;7) of wheat and barley (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012). The linear map orders and Haldane map distances among markers within these 14 linkage groups were determined by ‘regression mapping’ using only linkages with a recombination frequency smaller than 0.4, linkage LOD greater than 1.0, goodness-of-fit jump threshold of 5.0, with 1 ripple after each added locus.<br />The DH model of JoinMap was used to create linkage maps for gametes of the TC1 hybrid because the linkage phase of markers could not be determined a priori without the actual parental plants of these hybrids (Wu et&nbsp;al. 2003). However, the ancestry of most markers could be determined by differences in allele frequencies between the basin wildrye Acc:636 and creeping wildrye Acc:641 parental accessions and it was expected that most of the markers segregating in the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross population came from creeping wildrye. Thus, parental alleles for all markers were ultimately determined by DH model linkage analysis and subsequently recompiled using the inferred linkage phase information and inferred parental ancestries for use in the first-generation backcross (BC1) QTL mapping model of MapQTL Version 6 (Van Ooijen 2009).<br />Rhizome spreading evaluations<br />The perimeter of rhizome spreading (cm) in the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross population was measured on 10 clonally replicated ramets from each genotype. The 10 ramets were transplanted into two independent 6&nbsp;m2 row plots, organized in a randomized complete block design, in the spring of 2009.

Measurements of rhizomatous spreading in the creeping wildrye pseudobackcross field evaluation required staking out the outermost rhizome branches and measuring with a tape around the perimeter of the highly irregular swards (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006). Conversely, rhizomatous spreading of the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross genotypes was measured by simply wrapping a measuring tape around the symmetric plants. The basin Acc:636 and creeping Acc:641 wildrye parental accessions were included in the previous creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross field evaluation (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006), but excluded from this basin wildrye pseudo-backcross field evaluation because creeping wildrye rhizomes would have invaded adjacent plots and confounded identification of plants. However, all measurements of rhizome spreading in the creeping and basin wildrye pseudo-backcross experiments were taken in mid-June, after rhizome emergence from the soil surface.<br />QTL analyses<br />The average perimeter of rhizome spread for each genotype was determined by least square means of individual measurements from each ramet using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, 1999). Genome-wide QTL interval mapping (IM) was performed using the first-generation backcross (BC1) population models of MapQTL 6.0 (Van Ooijen 2009). Permutation analyses (Churchill and Doerge 1994) indicated a threshold of 3.1 LOD as a close approximation of the genome-wide 5&nbsp;% significance level for the QTL analyses of the perimeter of rhizome spreading in the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross mapping population. The final location of QTL peaks and percent variation explained (PVE) by all QTLs were determined using the restricted multiple QTL model (rMQM) (Jansen and Stam, 1994) for a BC1 population in MapQTL 6.0 (Van Ooijen 2009). Linkage map diagrams and corresponding QTL graphs were constructed using MapChart 2.2 (Voorrips 2002).<br />QTL confidence bounds<br />Confidence bounds for QTL locations were determined using a 2 LOD drop-off interval (Mangin et&nbsp;al. 1994) and non-parametric resampling methods (Visscher et&nbsp;al. 1996; Crossett et&nbsp;al. 2010) with the following modifications. Non-parametric resampling was performed using a jackknife procedure with random deletion of 10 or 50&nbsp;% of the 250 progeny without replacement, rather than bootstrap resampling with replacement. Unlike the permutation analysis used to determine LOD significance thresholds<br /><br />(Churchill and Doerge 1994), these bootstrap and jackknife resampling techniques always pair trait values with the same genotypic data as in the original dataset (Crossett et&nbsp;al. 2010). In practice, jackknifing can be easily implemented by randomly deleting trait data and creating one new trait for each jackknifed resampling, whereas bootstrapping requires coordinated restructuring of genotypic data and trait data for each bootstrapped sample (Crossett et&nbsp;al. 2010). Jackknife resampling with 10&nbsp;%-deletion or 50&nbsp;%-deletion of progeny results in progressively lower LOD values and lower percent variation explained compared to the complete set of progeny or bootstrapping, which always maintains the same number of progeny as the original dataset. However, the location of QTLs determined by jackknife or bootstrap resampling remains unbiased. Random and repetitive deletions of 10&nbsp;% of the progeny enable measurement of error caused by a few possible outliers, whereas random deletions 50&nbsp;% of the progeny result in substantially more sample variation and more conservative confidence bounds for the potential locations of QTLs. A total of 1,000 jackknife samples were taken for each analysis of 10&nbsp;%-deletion IM analysis, 50&nbsp;%-deletion IM analysis, 10&nbsp;%-deletion rMQM analysis, and 50&nbsp;%-deletion rMQM analysis. The one-sided 95 and 99&nbsp;% confidence bounds for each set of 1,000 jackknife samples were determined by summing the number of samples that contained QTL peaks at each locus on the map. Thus, a total of 50 and 10 jackknife QTL peaks lie outside the upper- or low-bounds of the 95 and 99&nbsp;% confidence bounds, respectively.<br />Comparative mapping<br />The linkage map order and genetic recombination distances (cM) between ESTs markers associated with perimeter of rhizome spreading in perennial wildrye were compared to the physical map order and mega-base (Mb) distances of homologous gene sequences in the Brachypodium genome sequence (The International Brachypodium Initiative 2010) using MapChart 2.2 (Voorrips 2002) based on previous gene sequence alignments (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2012; Childs et&nbsp;al. 2012). Likewise, the primary physical locations of Brachypodium genome sequences homologous to rice genome sequences (approximately 10,000&nbsp;bp) surrounding four rice microsatellite markers (rm142, rm119, rm273, and rm252) associated with the rice and sorghum Rhz3 orthogene (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003) were determined using the Gramene BLASTN (Ware et&nbsp;al. 2002). Moreover, a comprehensive list of gene models located between 54.3 and 59.7&nbsp;Mb on Brachypodium chromosome 3 and corresponding perennial wildrye EST alignments (Supplementary Table S2) was generated using the Biofuel Feedstock Genomics Resource genome browser (Childs et&nbsp;al. 2012).<br /><br />13<br /><br />Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />389<br /><br />Fig. 1  Comparison of genome-wide interval mapping QTL scans for<br />the perimeter of rhizome spreading over 14 linkage groups (LGs) of perennial wildrye. a The basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross popu-<br /><br />lation and b the combined analysis of the creeping wildrye TTC1 and TTC2 pseudo-backcross populations<br /><br />Results<br />Phenotypic expression of&nbsp;rhizomatous growth habit in&nbsp;a creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrid and&nbsp;basin wildrye backcross population<br />The perimeter of spreading for the basin wildrye C-tester and creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye TC1 hybrid averaged (±standard errors) 53&nbsp;±&nbsp;5 and 140&nbsp;±&nbsp;4, respectively.

The mean perimeter of rhizome spreading in the TCC population was 69 with a variance of 154 among the genotypic means used for QTL analyses. The distribution of TCC genotypic means showed positive kurtosis (0.31) and skewness (0.79), indicating a somewhat narrow range of values with a larger tail of high values compared to a normal distribution.<br />Comparison of&nbsp;genome‑wide QTL scans in&nbsp;the reciprocal creeping and&nbsp;basin wildrye pseudo‑backcross populations<br />Genome-wide QTL IM scans associated with the perimeter of rhizome spreading from the new basin wildrye TCC mapping population were compared to the combined QTL analysis of the creeping wildrye TTC1 and TTC2 pseudo-backcross mapping populations based on linkage group identity and orientation (Table&nbsp;1). A genome-wide QTL IM scan of the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross population detected two significant QTLs on LG-2a and<br /><br />-6a (Fig.&nbsp;1a). Significant consensus QTLs were previously detected (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013) on LG-3a (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.9), -3b (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.3), and -6a (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.6) in the creeping wildrye TTC1 and TTC2 pseudo-backcross populations (Fig.&nbsp;1B). Thus, the distal long arm of LG-6a had significant effects in the reciprocal creeping and basin wildrye pseudo-backcross mapping populations (Fig.&nbsp;1). However, the LG-2a QTL was unique to the new basin wildrye TCC pseudobackcross mapping population, whereas the LG-3a and -3b QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye TTC pseudobackcross populations (Fig.&nbsp;1).

Seven of these eight LG-2a EST markers align to Brachypodium Chromosome 5, with similar map order (Fig.&nbsp;2). The LG-2a Ltc1144 EST marker aligns to a locus on Brachypodium Chromosome 1. The two best LG-2a QTL markers, detected by rMQM analysis, were E37M60.243 (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;10.6) and E41M47.429 (LOD&nbsp; =&nbsp;10.0) (Fig.&nbsp;2). However, other markers between E36M49.124 (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;9.5) and E36M62.196 (LOD&nbsp;=&nbsp;9.3) also had relatively high LOD values (Fig.&nbsp;2). The 57.4&nbsp;cM interval between E36M49.124 and E36M62.196 includes two perennial wildrye EST markers, Ltc0699 and Ltc0717, which align to a 6.0&nbsp;Mb interval on Brachypodium Chromosome 5 (Fig.&nbsp;2). The rice rm142, rm119, rm273, and rm252 Rhz3 QTL markers align to a 5.4&nbsp;Mb interval, including 5.3&nbsp;Mb contained within the 6.0&nbsp;Mb interval between Ltc0699 and Ltc0717 ortholoci on Brachypodium Chromosome 5 (Fig.&nbsp;2).<br /><br />Primers used to map the IAA10 gene in the creeping&nbsp; ×&nbsp;basin wildrye pseudo-backross mapping populations amplified identical sequences from cDNA prepared from rhizome meristems of TC1 creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrid. Moreover, other primers designed from exons 2 and 4 of the barley IAA10 gene amplified a processed cDNA sequence (KF489901) from rhizome meristems of TC1 creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrid, which aligns to the barley, Brachypodium and rice IAA10 orthogene. The corresponding IAA10 wildrye genomic DNA (KF489902) showed inferred-splicing patterns identical to the inferred or predicted splicing patterns the barley, Brachypodium, and rice IAA10 orthogene.<br />Discussion<br />The genetic control of&nbsp;rhizome proliferation in&nbsp;perennial wildrye<br /><br />Genomic localization of&nbsp;the LG‑6a perennial wildrye rhizome QTL and&nbsp;candidate genes<br />Extensive testing of perennial wildrye EST markers aligned to various regions of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 (Supplementary Table S1) yielded a total of 33 markers mapped to LG-6a and 19 markers mapped to homoeologous LG6b (Table&nbsp;1). A subset of 14 markers within the 3.80-cM LG-6a QTL interval were aligned to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 (Fig.&nbsp;3). An integrated list of 106 discrete gene loci inferred from a comprehensive list of 106 Brachypodium gene models and 75 corresponding perennial wildrye EST markers (Supplementary Table S2) revealed a Brachypodium auxin-responsive protein IAA10 gene nested within a block of other genes aligned to five perennial wildrye ESTs, which cosegregated with the wildrye rhizome QTL peak (Fig.&nbsp;3). Heterologous primers (Supplementary Table S1) made from the barley ortholog of this Brachypodium IAA10 gene model amplified 227-bp creeping wildrye and 185-bp basin wildrye alleles, which were mapped to orthologous positions on LG-6a in the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross population (Fig.&nbsp;3) and the creeping wildrye TTC1 and TTC2 pseudo-backcross population (Results not shown). Thus, the IAA10 marker and five other perennial wildrye rhizome EST markers cosegregated with the LG-6a rhizome QTL peak. The IAA10 marker LOD (31.6) was 0.8 LOD greater than the next best markers including Ltc0182 and LG6L024, and 0.9 LOD greater than the other LG6L026 flanking marker locus (Fig.&nbsp;3).<br /><br />Rhizome growth is controlled by at least two recessive, one dominant, and one additive gene in perennial wildrye. Inferences concerning the number of genes and effects of genes controlling rhizome development are constrained by our sampling of creeping wildrye and basin wildrye parent genotypes and the extent of genetic variation within and between these species. Nevertheless, phenotypic differences in the perimeter of rhizome spreading between rhizomatous creeping wildrye and caespitose basin wildrye are quite extreme and relatively discrete (Supplemental Figure S1). Thus, some general conclusions concerning growth habit differences between these species can be made based on comparisons of these reciprocal pseudo-backcross populations. We deduce that the caespitose basin wildrye LG-2a growth habit QTL allele was recessive because it was not detectable in the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations, whereas the creeping wildrye rhizome LG-2a QTL allele was dominant because it was unique to the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population. Conversely, we deduce that the creeping wildrye LG-3a and -3b rhizome QTL alleles were recessive because they were not detectable in the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population, whereas the caespitose basin wildrye LG-3a and -3b growth habit QTL alleles were dominant because they were unique to the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations. By similar logic, we deduce that LG-6a rhizome QTL had additive effects because it was detectable in the reciprocal creeping and basin wildrye pseudo-backcross populations.<br />Comparisons of phenotypic differences between species and QTL effects suggest epistatic effects among<br /><br />13<br /><br />Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />393<br /><br />non-additive genes. The average&nbsp;±&nbsp;SE perimeter of rhizome spreading in the creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids (about 198&nbsp;±&nbsp;24&nbsp;cm) was substantially less than the midparent of creeping wildrye (702&nbsp;±&nbsp;42&nbsp;cm) and basin wildrye (57&nbsp;±&nbsp;43&nbsp;cm) (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013). Combined estimates of the dominant LG-2a QTL (9&nbsp;cm) and additive LG-6a QTL (15&nbsp;cm) from the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population accounted for approximately 17&nbsp;% of the difference between basin wildrye and the creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids (141&nbsp;cm). Likewise, combined estimates of the additive LG-6a QTL (63&nbsp;cm), recessive LG-3a QTL (81&nbsp;cm), and recessive LG-3b QTL (65&nbsp;cm) from the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross population (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013) accounted for about 41&nbsp;% of the difference between creeping wildrye and the creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids (504&nbsp;cm). The combined effects of all QTLs from the reciprocal creeping and basin wildrye pseudo-backross populations account for approximately 36&nbsp;% of the total difference between species (about 645&nbsp;cm). Although the rMQM statistical methods used to estimate each of these gene effects were adjusted for epistatic effects of other QTLs segregating within these pseudo-backcross populations (Jansen and Stam 1994), these methods do not account for other potentially complex interactions between non-additive QTL effects that were unique to the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (e.g., LG-3a and -3b QTLs) or the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population (e.g., LG-2a QTL). For example, estimates of LG-6a QTL effects in the creeping wildrye TTC1 (63&nbsp;cm) and TTC2 (60&nbsp;cm) pseudo-backcross populations (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013) were not adjusted for effects of the dominant LG2a rhizome QTL, which was unique to the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross. Conversely, estimates of LG-6a QTL effects in the basin wildrye TCC pseudo-backcross population (about 15&nbsp;cm) were not adjusted for effects of the recessive LG3a and LG3b rhizome QTLs, which were unique to the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations. Thus, we hypothesize that epistatic interactions between dominant, recessive, and other non-additive QTL effects may account for differences between creeping and basin wildrye that could not be explained by QTL effects detected within these pseudobackcross populations.<br />The precision of rhizome QTL mapping was greater in the basin wildrye background compared to the creeping wildrye background. The percent variation explained and LOD values of QTLs detected in the basin wildrye pseudobackcross population were much greater than those of the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (Fig.&nbsp;1). The combined effects of the LG-3a, -3b, and -6a consensus QTLs explained about 19&nbsp;% of the total phenotypic variation for perimeter of rhizome spreading in the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013), whereas the LG-2a and -6a QTLs explained 53&nbsp;% of the<br /><br />phenotypic variation in the basin wildrye TCC pseudobackcross population. Thus, the precision of LG-6a QTL mapping, in terms of location and confidence intervals, is much greater in the basin wildrye background, even though the additive effect of this QTL was much less in the basin wildrye background.<br />Correspondence of&nbsp;QTLs and&nbsp;mutations controlling rhizome and&nbsp;tiller development in&nbsp;other grass species<br />The dominant LG-2a rhizome QTL of perennial wildrye aligned to the dominant Rhz3 rhizome QTL of rice and sorghum. However, the putative Rhz3 orthogene (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003; Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995) had somewhat different gene effects in rice and sorghum. The sorghum Rhz3 QTL had significant effects on tiller number, subterranean rhizomatousness, and spring regrowth, but did not affect distance of rhizome spreading (Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995). The putative sorghum Rhz3 was unusual in that the dominant subterranean rhizomatousness allele came from the non-rhizomatous annual sorghum species (S. bicolor) (Paterson et&nbsp;al. 1995). The rice Rhz3 QTL had relatively strong effects on all measured rhizome traits, including rhizome number, rhizome branching degree, rhizome branch number, rhizome length, rhizome internode number, and rhizome biomass (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003). The rice Rhz3 gene accounted for greater phenotypic variance and affected more rhizome-related traits compared to QTLs detected in the annual&nbsp;×&nbsp;perennial rice mapping population (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003). The perennial rice Rhz3 allele had positive and dominant effects for all rhizome-related traits, including rhizome length (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2003). Thus, LG-2a rhizome QTL of perennial wildrye is most similar to the rice Rhz3 QTL in terms of phenotypic effects.<br />Alignments of the LG-3a, -3b, and -6a rhizome QTLs, from the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations, to recessive mutations that reduce tillering of cereal grasses were previously discussed (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008a; Larson et&nbsp;al. 2013) without knowledge of the recessive or additive nature of these perennial wildrye rhizome QTLs. Results of this study indicate that the recessive LG-3a and -3b creeping wildrye QTL alleles increase rhizome spreading whereas the corresponding recessive barley absent lower laterals (Dabbert et&nbsp;al. 2009), wheat tiller inhibition3 (Kuraparthy et&nbsp;al. 2008), barley low number of tillers1 (Dabbert et&nbsp;al. 2010), and the maize barren stalk1 (Gallavotti et&nbsp;al. 2004) mutations all decrease tiller production. Thus, the proliferation of rhizomes caused by the recessive creeping wildrye LG-3a and -3b QTL alleles was not analogous to recessive mutations that decrease tiller number in cereals. However, relatively strong effects of the LG-6a rhizome QTL detected in the basin wildrye pseudo-backcross population could be analogous to the recessive barley uniculm2<br /><br />13<br /><br />3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 94 Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397<br /><br />mutant, which initiates axillary meristems but fails to develop tillers (Babb and Muehlbauer 2003).<br />Genomic localization of&nbsp;the perennial wildrye LG‑6a rhizome QTL and&nbsp;candidate genes<br />The 2-LOD drop-off interval and nonparametric 99&nbsp;% confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD LG-6a rhizome QTL peak were aligned to a relatively small region of the Brachypodium genome containing 106 gene loci including an IAA10 auxin inducible gene, which cosegregated with five other rhizome EST markers at the QTL peak. The Brachypodium genome contains a total of 25,532 predicted protein-coding genes, including 24 ARF and 25 Aux/IAA genes (see Supplementary Information, The International Brachypodium Initiative, 2010). There were only 49 Brachypodium gene loci between the Ltc0182 and LGL026 markers flanking the actual IAA10 rhizome QTL peak (Fig.&nbsp;3; Table S2). Thus, there was only a 5&nbsp;% probability of having at least one Aux/IAA gene closely associated with this QTL peak by chance alone.<br />A relatively large number of mutations affecting plant gravitropism, phototropism, and apical dominance involve auxin signaling (Liscum and Reed 2002; Hohm et&nbsp;al. 2013; Vandenbussche et&nbsp;al. 2013). In fact, most Aux/IAA mutations have some effects on gravitropism or phototropism in various plant meristems (Liscum and Reed 2002). Moreover, the complexity of potential interactions among specific proteins encoded by the Aux/IAA and ARF gene families (Teale et&nbsp;al. 2006; Vernoux et&nbsp;al. 2011; Sauer et&nbsp;al. 2013) is potentially diverse enough to modulate tissue-specific and temporal variation in the gravitropic and phototropic responses displayed by stems of rhizomatous grasses. The large number of possible ARF-Aux/IAA interactions may also help account for evolutionary diversity in growth habit observed among grass species.<br />The orthology of Aux/IAA genes among divergent plant species is complex. The Chromosome-6 IAA10 orthogenes of barley and perennial wildrye are orthologous to the Brachypodium Chromosome-3 IAA10 gene and the rice Chromosome-6 IAA10 gene (Jain et&nbsp;al. 2006) based on sequence alignments and annotation (Ware et&nbsp;al. 2002; Childs et&nbsp;al. 2012) of the corresponding genome reference sequences (The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005; The International Brachypodium Initiative 2010; The International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium 2012). The rice IAA10 orthogene also corresponds to the maize Chromosome-4 IAA12 (Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010b) and sorghum Chromosome-4 IAA14 (Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010a) orthogenes. Moreover, the rice IAA10, sorghum IAA14, and maize IAA12 proteins are similar to the Arabidopsis IAA10, IAA11, IAA12, and IAA13 proteins (Jain et&nbsp;al. 2006; Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010a, b). Likewise, the rice IAA10 and maize<br /><br />IAA12 genes are most similar to the potato/tomato IAA5, IAA22, and IAA25 genes (Wu et&nbsp;al. 2012). Thus, the perennial wildrye IAA10 gene was aligned to one orthogene in other monocotyledonous grasses, which are similar to a group of three or four related Aux/IAA genes in dicotyledonous plants, including the Arabidopsis IAA12-Bodenlos gene. Bodenlos is a gain-of-function mutation resulting from a single amino-acid change in the conserved degradation domain, which stabilizes the Arabidopsis IAA12 protein (Hamann et&nbsp;al. 2002; Liscum and Reed 2002). The Bodenlos mutant fails to initiate root meristem during early embryogenesis and has up-curled leaves (Hamann et&nbsp;al. 2002; Liscum and Reed 2002). Mutations of the rice IAA10, maize IAA12, or sorghum IAA14 genes have not been described, but expression of these genes has been examined in some grass species.<br />Expression of the IAA10 orthogene and other Aux/IAA genes has been documented in perennial wildrye and other plant species. In comparisons of 26 sorghum Aux/IAA genes, the sorghum IAA14 gene showed relatively high expression in seedling stem and leaf tissues compared to roots (Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010a). Maize IAA12 transcripts were detected in meristem and root tissues, but lacking in callus, seedling, and floral tissues (Wang et&nbsp;al. 2010b). Comparisons of gene expression among vegetative root, shoot, and leaf tissues of rice showed that expression of the IAA10 gene was highest in shoot tissues (Fujita et&nbsp;al. 2010; Jain et&nbsp;al. 2006; Jain and Khurana 2009). More specific comparisons of the rice IAA10 gene in shoot tips, shoot internodes, rhizome tips, and rhizome internodes using the Rice 57&nbsp;K microarray probe-set Os.4806.1.S1_at (Dash et&nbsp;al. 2012), showed relatively high expression of the IAA10 gene in rhizome tips of perennial rice but it was not classified as a rhizome-specific gene (Hu et&nbsp;al. 2011). Likewise, comparison of barley IAA10 gene expression among vegetative crown, shoot, and root tissues of germinating embryos and seedlings, using the Barley1 22&nbsp;K microarray probe-set contig15125_at (Dash et&nbsp;al. 2012), showed that expression of the gene was relatively high in the coleoptile and shoot (leaf) tissues (Druka et&nbsp;al. 2006). Although the IAA10 gene was not present among 11,281 rhizome meristem ESTs from creeping&nbsp;×&nbsp;basin wildrye hybrids (Bushman et&nbsp;al. 2008), primers designed from the barley Chromosome-6 IAA10 gene amplified spliced exon sequences from cDNA of perennial wildrye rhizomes (Results above). The IAA10 gene transcript was also detected in perennial wildrye rhizome meristems of the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations, using the Barley 22&nbsp;K microarray probe-set Contig15125_at (Supplemental Data, Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b). However, the effects of the LG-6a QTL on the perimeter of rhizome spreading were much less significant in the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (Larson et&nbsp;al. 2006), compared to the basin wildrye pseudobackcross population, and comparisons of gene expression<br /><br />13<br /><br />Mol Genet Genomics (2014) 289:383–397&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />395<br /><br />in the creeping wildrye background were designed to test the effects of the LG-3a rhizome QTL using a pooled analysis of contrasting LG-3a marker genotypes (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b). Thus, it is not possible to test for differences in expression of the IAA10 alleles using data from the creeping wildrye pseudo-backcross populations (Kaur et&nbsp;al. 2008b). Moreover, a number of recognized IAA gene mutations, including the Bodenlos, involve protein stability with no reported difference in gene transcript abundance (Hamann et&nbsp;al. 2002). Although expression of the IAA10 gene needs to be carefully examined, it may not be possible to detect differences in expression even if this IAA10 is the correct candidate gene.<br />The LG-6a rhizome QTL interval aligned to105 other Brachypodium gene loci, including at least one other hormone-related ethylene receptor 2 gene, one homeodomain gene, two F-box genes, and 18 genes of unknown function. Auxin interacts with ethylene and brassinosteroids to control shoot gravitropism (Vandenbussche et&nbsp;al. 2013), but there are relatively few ethylene receptors (Wang et&nbsp;al. 2013) and it is unlikely that mutations of an ethylene receptor could modulate the tissue-specific and temporal variation observed in gravitropic or phototropic responses of rhizomatous grass stems. Shoot auxin gradients and gravitropism are controlled by other genes, beyond the Aux/IAA gene family, such as the functionally conserved tiller angle control 1 (TAC1) and LAZY1 gene family that is also present in diverse plant species, including rice and maize (Dardick et&nbsp;al. 2013; Yoshihara et&nbsp;al. 2013). The formation and growth of lateral branches in grasses and other plants are also controlled by homeodomain-leucine-zipper transcription factors (Lynn et&nbsp;al. 1999; Otsuga et&nbsp;al. 2001) and other transcription factors containing basic helix-loop-helix (Komatsu et&nbsp;al. 2003; Gallavotti et&nbsp;al. 2004), class I HD-Zip (Whipple et&nbsp;al. 2011), GRASS (Li et&nbsp;al. 2003), LOB (Bortiri et&nbsp;al. 2006), MYB (Schmitz et&nbsp;al. 2002), or TCP (Cubas et&nbsp;al. 1999) protein domains (Bennet and Leyser 2006). Moreover, tillering is also controlled by microRNAs (Chuck et&nbsp;al. 2007), other genes (Zou et&nbsp;al. 2006; Arite et&nbsp;al. 2009; Liu et&nbsp;al. 2009), and other hormones (Domagalska and Leyser 2011) beyond the immediate pathways of auxin signaling. However, none of the genes found in the LG-6a QTL–Brachypodium alignment was orthologous to any of the known genes related to shoot gravitropism or grass tillering. F-box containing proteins play a crucial role in plant growth and development, including auxin perception and signaling (Villalobos et&nbsp;al. 2012), and comprise one of the largest known families of regulatory proteins in higher plants (Jia et&nbsp;al. 2013). It is possible that F-box proteins could have specific gravitropic or phototropic effects, but the two F-box genes of possible interest are located on flanking sides of the Ltc0171 marker on the outer edge of widest, 95&nbsp;% confidence bounds obtained from the most conservative 50&nbsp;%-delete jackknife resampling analyses (Fig.&nbsp;3). Thus, these two F-box genes were beyond the 2-LOD drop<br /><br />off and other more narrow 99 and 95&nbsp;% confidence bounds obtained from 10&nbsp;%-delete jackknife resampling or even the 99&nbsp;% confidence bounds obtained from 50&nbsp;%-delete jackknife resampling (Fig.&nbsp;3). Thus, we believe that IAA10 is the best candidate gene in the perennial wildrye LG-6a rhizome QTL–Brachypodium Chromosome 3 alignment based on map position, limited gene expression information, and known functions of the Aux/IAA genes in plants. However, it is possible that the actual LG-6a rhizome gene is not present in Brachypodium.<br />Progress towards&nbsp;identification of&nbsp;genes controlling rhizome proliferation in&nbsp;grasses<br />Regardless of whether or not IAA10 is responsible for the relatively strong, additive rhizome gene effects associated with perennial wildrye LG-6a QTL, this study describes an experimental system that provides a tangible opportunity to identify at least one potential important gene that could be used to modify rhizome development and growth habit of temperate perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of wheat, or control the invasive rhizomes of problematic weeds such as quackgrass. Likewise, alignment of the dominant perennial wildrye LG-2a QTL to dominant Rhz3 orthogenes of perennial rice and sorghum species helps pinpoint functionally conserved rhizome genes among highly divergent grass species. Alignments of these perennial wildrye rhizome QTLs to Brachypodium and other grass genome reference sequences provide a useful approach for in silico identification of candidate genes. Moreover, next-generation sequence-based mapping approaches (Dardick et&nbsp;al. 2013) can be used to identify potentially unique genes in these perennial grasses, which may not be present in Brachypodium, barley, or other species that have fully sequenced genomes. The eventual identification of genes controlling rhizome development in perennial grasses will further elucidate the evolution of widely variable growth habit and architectural traits in other plants (Bennet and Leyser 2006; Dardick et&nbsp;al. 2013).<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: Agnew, M.L., Christians, N.E., Sod reestablishment of 5 Kentucky bluegrass cultivars (1992) J Prod Agric, 5, pp.

Introduction<br /><br />Over the past century, agricultural research has contributed to dramatically increased crop yields and productivity, yet this increase in productivity has often come at the expense of long term environmental sustainability through greater use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers, the depletion of fresh water, and the reduction of arable land (Baulcombe et al., 2009 and Tilman et al., 2002). Addressing environmental damage and enhancing ecosystem services such as climate regulation, water management, and soil fertility will be essential for the adequate production of food in the future (Baulcombe et al., 2009, Costanza et al., 1997 and Tilman et al., 2002). Currently there are cultural practices such as zero tillage and cover cropping, which provide many ecosystem services without a yield reduction. Recently, the addition of perennial plants, particularly perennial crops, has been suggested as another tool for incorporating ecosystem services into the landscape while maintaining productivity (DeHaan et al., 2005, Baulcombe et al., 2009, Glover et al., 2010 and Chia et al., 2012). The potential of perennial crops to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural systems through reduction in fall tillage, soil erosion, and nutrient runoff has long been ignored, but recently has regained popular interest (Glover et al., 2010). In addition, due to reduced input costs, perennial grains can be as profitable as annual counterparts over a three year life of the perennial crop if the market price is equal and the perennial yields at least 60% as much as the annual crop (Bell et al., 2008).<br /><br />Recent research has shown that the genetics of perenniality (development of perennial organs) may not be as complex as previously thought, with several studies identifying only a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) necessary for perennial organ development (Wang et al., 2009, Sacks et al., 2007 and Hu et al., 2003). Hu et al. (2003) identified two QTL that controlled production of rhizomes in rice (Oryza longisteminata × Oryza sativa hybrids) with the segregation matching a dominant two gene model with complementary gene action. Stolon presence:absence segregated in a 3:1 fashion in F2 families of the interspecific cross O. sativa × O. rufipogon ( Sacks et al., 2007). Further, Wang et al. (2009) identified a single gene, perpetual flowering 1 (PEP1), which regulates perennial flowering in Arabis alpina. These findings suggest it may be possible to introduce perennial habit into annual crops without introducing large portions of wild relatives of the species.<br /><br />Domesticated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L., 2n = 2x = 34) is an annual crop that produces a diverse range of products, including oilseed types (used to produce birdseed or high-quality vegetable oil) and confection seeds for direct human consumption. Sunflower is a compelling target for perennialization, as Helianthus includes 49 species, many of which are perennial ( Kane et al., 2013). Breeders have used interspecific hybridization to introgress useful wild traits into H. annuus for disease resistance ( Miller and Gulya, 1987), insect resistance ( Charlet and Brewer, 1995), adaptation to distinct environments, abiotic stress ( Rieseberg, 1997), and cytoplasmic male sterility ( Kohler and Friedt, 1999). A similar approach could be used to introgress the perennial habit, as perennial Helianthus species can potentially be used as donor materials for transferring perennial habit into domesticated sunflower. Breeding for perennial seed crops poses a unique problem because perennials need to allocate photosynthetic resources to both the perennial organs used for carbon storage and the seed itself ( DeHaan et al., 2005). It has been suggested that perennial plants can be selected for increased seed production while maintaining asexual reproduction ( Cox et al., 2002 and DeHaan et al., 2005). Perennial plants have a longer growing season to assimilate nutrients and breeding can influence photosynthate utilization to optimize seed production and perennial habit. In addition, there is historical precedent as farmers who initially domesticated rice selected for perennial habit during low intensity production ( Hill, 2010).<br /><br />Helianthus tuberosus, a tuber-bearing perennial species, is a prime candidate for the introduction of perenniality into domestic sunflower. It has been used to introgress traits into H. annuus for nearly a century and has a separate history as a specialty crop ( Hulke and Wyse, 2008). H. tuberosus (2n = 6x = 102), is an autoallohexaploid with three sub-genomes. The three sub-genomes have been traditionally designated as A1, A2, and Bt ( Kostoff, 1939). The Bt sub-genome is thought to be very similar to the H. annuus genome ( Kostoff, 1934, Kostoff, 1939 and Scibria, 1938), which may help stabilize meiotic chromosome pairing in interspecific hybrids between the two species. Through conventional hybridization it is possible to create large populations of interspecific H. annuus × H. tuberosus hybrids. The hybrids are perennial by way of tuber-sprouting and have good fitness. Commercial varieties have been released in Russia and Sweden for tuber production and forage purposes ( Kays and Nottingham, 2008). H. annuus × H. tuberosus hybrids generally have a stable intermediate number of chromosomes (2n = 4x = 68), although meiotic abnormalities can reduce fertility and decrease stability in initial generations ( Sujatha and Prabakaran, 2006, Chandler et al., 1986 and Atlagic et al., 1993).<br /><br />Three breeding strategies have been proposed to create perennial grain crops: direct domestication of perennial relatives of crop plants, transgenic modification of annual plants, and genetic introgression of perennial habit from wild relatives into domesticated crops through wide hybridization (Glover et al., 2010). There is doubt regarding the feasibility of direct domestication of perennial sunflower relatives as QTL mapping studies within annual sunflower suggest that a larger number of loci contribute to domestication-related phenotypes in sunflower than in other species (Burke et al., 2002, Wills and Burke, 2007 and Doebley and Stec, 1991), Furthermore, the most important domestication trait in sunflower is suppression of axillary flowers (single headed state) (Chapman et al., 2008), a trait present at low frequencies in wild sunflower populations. Transgenic modification is not possible at present, as no known “perenniality” genes have been identified for sunflower, and only one has been identified so far in other species (Wang et al., 2009). Moreover, sunflower is recalcitrant to regeneration and transformation (Lewi et al., 2006 and Piqueras et al., 2010), and gene flow issues with weedy conspecifics have halted regulatory acceptance of transgenic sunflower (Snow et al., 2003). Introgression of perennial habit from wild relatives through wide hybridization may be the most feasible approach. The main advantage of this approach is that a copy of the domesticated genome is present in a hybrid, enabling the selection of existing domesticated or elite loci that may not be present at high frequency in the wild germplasm. This approach can be implemented in at least two different ways: (1) selection on a population backcrossed to the domesticated parent or; (2) recurrent selection on populations derived from intermating the hybrid materials.<br /><br />This study evaluates an interspecific population of H. tuberosus × H. annuus as a base for developing a perennial oil-seed sunflower. We validate the interspecific origin of hybrid populations, examine parental diversity, and then evaluate the potential for improving the perennial populations based on the interactions between perennial, agronomic, fertility and yield traits.<br />2. Materials and methods<br />2.1. Populations<br /><br />Five populations were investigated. The first population was 18 H. tuberosus individuals collected from UMore Park in Rosemount, MN. The second was a set of 187 interspecific F1 hybrids between H. annuus and H. tuberosus. The interspecific hybrids were developed during the years 2003–2006 ( Hulke and Wyse, 2008) by crossing the 18 H. tuberosus (perennial) parents with three inbred H. annuus (annual) lines (CMS HA 89 [PET1], HA 89 (released by the USDA-ARS in 1971) and HA 434 ( Miller et al., 2004)). HA 89 and HA 434 were used as male parents and CMS HA 89 was used as a female parent (Supplementary Table 1). The third population was a derivative of the second, as the F1 hybrids were intermated to form an intermated F1 population (designated as the IM1F1 population). This population was developed in 2007 by Hulke and Wyse (2008) (Supplementary Table 1). The fourth population was a backcross of the interspecific F1 to the inbred lines HA 434 and HA 89 (designated as the BC1F1 population). This population was developed in 2006 by Hulke and Wyse (2008) (Supplementary Table 1). The fifth population was 31 H. tuberosus plants from the seed stocks of the United States Department of Agriculture Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) that were collected from a diverse set of geographical locations (Supplementary Table 1) ( USDA, 2012).<br />2.2. Flow cytometry<br /><br />Individuals in the following populations were examined for genome size using flow cytometry: 187 interspecific F1s, 170 IM1F1s, 120 BC1F1s, the 18 H. tuberosus parental lines and two of the H. annuus parental lines (HA 89 and HA 434).<br /><br />Nuclear DNA content was assessed using a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer. Two technical replicates of the same clone were performed (on different days) for each plant on 42 F1 individuals and the inbred annual lines. A single measurement was performed on the other individuals. Fully expanded leaf tissue sections of 0.55 cm2 were finely chopped in 500 ml of extraction buffer (Partec, CyStain PI Absolut P), followed by filtration through a 50 micron nylon mesh. Filtered nuclei were stained with 2 ml of propidium iodide staining solution (Partec, CyStain PI Absolut P), stored at 4 °C, and examined within 12 h of preparation. A commercial standard of trout erythrocytes (Partec, DNA Control UV, 25 ml) as well as the internal standard from diploid HA 89 were used to calculate DNA content. A minimum of 1000 nuclei were examined for each sample. DNA content was calculated by taking the ratio of the peak intensity of each sample to that of the known standard and then multiplying the ratio by the picogram (pg) genome size of the standard. The BC1F1 populations were characterized with freeze dried tissue, which has decreased fluorescence relative to fresh tissue (Doležel et al., 2007). Freeze dried samples were calibrated by identifying differences between freeze dried and fresh tissue of the same clone in a subsample of 40 F1 individuals. Ploidy boundaries were assessed by constructing 95% confidence intervals around the mean genome content of each population and comparing the genome content to the known values in the literature. Confidence intervals were constructed by 1000 bootstrap replications from the empirical distribution of each population. Briefly, a random sample was drawn with replacement from genome sizes in each population, creating a new distribution from which the 2.5% and the 97.5% individuals were used to create a 95% confidence interval for each ploidy level (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).<br />2.3. Phenotyping of the interspecific populations<br />2.3.1. F1 phenotyping<br /><br />The 187 F1 hybrids (H. tuberosus × H. annuus) and 18 H. tuberosus parents were field grown in St. Paul (2009 and 2010) and Rosemount, Minnesota (2010). Plants were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replications per environment. The two environments were separated by approximately 35 km and differed in climate and soil: St. Paul (located at 45°00′ N 93°05′ W), has a soil type of fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls, and Rosemount (located at 44°44′ N 93°01′ W), has a soil type of a well-drained Waukegan silt loam (fine silty over sandy, mixed mesic Typic Hapludolls). F1 hybrids were transplanted as young plants newly emerged from tubers in May in both St. Paul 2009 and Rosemount 2010 from a living collection maintained in St. Paul. F1 hybrid tubers were harvested from the St. Paul 2009 planting and replanted in a different field in St. Paul in November 2009. All plants were grown one meter apart within rows and 1.8 meters apart between rows. Large tubers were used for planting, as sprouting and survival increase with larger tubers ( Kays and Nottingham, 2008). Plants were scored for 13 traits. The traits and phenotyping procedures are outlined in Table 1.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 1.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This table describes the phenotyping methodology for each trait examined.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days to flowering&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Counted from date of emergence in the spring to the appearance of the first flower<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total tuber number<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total tuber weight (grams)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average tuber weight (grams)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tubers were harvested in November 2009 by digging, washing, counting and weighing all tubers in a 0.5 m radius around each individual plant, as we observed that most tubers were centered in this area. To improve efficiency in data collection, in 2010, a subsample was taken at Rosemount and St. Paul that consisted of six 15 cm soil cores taken in a 0.5 m radius around each individual plant. The subsamples were calibrated to whole plot measurements by harvesting a row of plants (41 in total) in 2010 using the 2009 method. When the measurements of all tubers per plant in 2009 were compared to the partial sampling measured in 2010, the R2 = 0.71 for tuber number and R2 = 0.63 for tuber weight (based on individual plant), with the relationship between years fitting a linear model better than a quadratic model<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollen viability&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scored by staining pollen with Alexander stain and scoring 300 pollen grains from each replication (Alexander, 1980)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head number&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Counted for each plant at physiological maturity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Branching type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scored on a scale of 0-4 according to Hockett and Knowles (1970), with 0 being no branching<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreading ability&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Above ground plant spreading ability was scored on a 1-5 scale with 1 indicating the domestic phenotype of spreading to 15 cm, 2 indicated that plants spread 15-30 cm, 3 indicated intermediate spreading of 31-60 cm, 4 indicated vigorous spreading of 61-90 cm, 5 had spread greater than 90 cm<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum head diameter (cm)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Measured in cm after plant physiological maturity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average head diameter (cm)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Measured in cm after plant physiological maturity.

Plants were harvested as they reached physiological maturity, so early maturing individuals were harvested earlier<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average seed weight (grams)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculated by weighing the seed from the ten heads and dividing by the total number of seed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table options<br /><br />Statistical analysis was conducted using the R Statistical software package (R Development Core Team, 2012). Analysis of variance was conducted using families and individuals as fixed effects and environment as a random effect. Replications were nested within environment. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used to determine significant differences. Contrasts were performed with PROC GLM of SAS to test differences between H. tuberosus parents and F1 progeny ( SAS Institute, 2008). Means, ranges, and heritability were calculated for each trait evaluated and phenotypic correlations estimated for each pair of traits. Narrow sense heritability was calculated using the 18 H. tuberosus half-sib families within each environment and then pooled across environments using parent offspring regression ( Fehr, 1991). Parent-offspring regression coefficients were calculated by 1000 bootstrap replications from the residuals of an initial regression where wild parental values were used to predict the value of the interspecific progeny ( Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).<br />2.3.2. IM1F1 phenotyping<br /><br />F1 individuals were intermated to generate an IM1F1 population. In 2009, 71 IM1F1 plants were grown in St. Paul. The 55 surviving IM1F1 plants were phenotyped for average head diameter, largest head diameter, pollen viability, seeds per head, seed yield and individual seed weight in 2010 in St. Paul. During the winter of 2010–2011, 151 IM1F1 plants were grown in the greenhouse in St. Paul and screened for tuber production, along with H. tuberosus plants as controls. Plants in the greenhouse were grown in 30 cm pots with 50–50 mix of Sunshine professional growing mix® (Sun Gro) and soil. Plants were grown in a greenhouse with 14 h day-length at 24 °C, they were given no supplemental light. In 2011–2012, 104 tuber-bearing IM1F1 plants out of the 151 IM1F1 plants were transplanted in late May and grown in the field at Rosemount. As the IM1F1 population exhibited segregation for perennial habit and tuber traits, Chi-square tests were used to test examine segregation ratios for tuber presence in the IM1F1 population. We tested a single gene model where the expected ratio is 3:1 and a two gene model having complimentary gene action where the expected ratio is 9:7, both cases assumed disomic inheritance and equal initial allele frequencies.<br />2.4. Parental diversity analysis<br /><br />Thirty-one additional H. tuberosus accessions from the GRIN collection (Supplementary Table 1) were used to assess the diversity of the H. tuberosus germplasm, and estimate the representation of this diversity in our 18 lines used for breeding. DNA was prepared from the 31 accessions, along with 14 of the H. tuberosus and two of the H. annuus breeding parents, to assess diversity using molecular markers. Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh or freeze dried leaf tissue on all accessions using either a Qiagen Plant DNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol or a modified CTAB procedure optimized for sunflower ( Webb and Knapp, 1990).<br /><br />Sixteen expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers previously identified by Heesacker et al. (2008) were polymorphic in our population and used to genotype. Following DNA extraction, samples were sent to Biogenetic Services, Inc. (Brookings, SD). Samples were multiplexed by combining two loci, each with a different color label into a single plate. Multiplexed samples were loaded into the ABI3100 genetic analyzer and were run according to the manufacturer's standard recommendation. Direct labeled primers tagged with ABI dyes 6-FAM or Hex were scored on an Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI) 3730xl capillary instrument. The resulting electropherograms were scored using the GeneScan software package (ABI). A numerical base-pair size was assigned to each electropherogram peak. The program TANDEM (Matschiner and Salzburger, 2009) was used to bin raw allele sizes. The program PowerMarker (Liu and Muse, 2005) was used to analyze genotype data by calculating expected heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity and the average number of alleles per locus. The SSR markers utilized appeared to follow a stepwise mutation model therefore we used RST to differentiate the populations. RST is a measure of population differentiation that accounts for SSR markers undergoing a stepwise mutation model ( Slatkin, 1995). The stepwise mutation model postulates that an SSR marker will change (gain or lose) by only one repeat unit per generation ( Di Rienzo et al., 1994). RST was calculated between H. annuus parents, H. tuberosus parents, and GRIN accessions utilizing the program GENEPOP ( Rousset, 2008). The genetic distance between population pairs was calculated using the Nei73 coefficient ( Nei, 1973). An unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5 ( Tamura et al., 2011). Genetic assignment of genotypes was performed with Structure version 2.3.4 ( Pritchard et al., 2000). STRUCTURE was run with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) burn-in of 20,000 steps, followed by an MCMC chain of 10,000 steps for clustering inference. The number of subpopulations was determined by performing ten runs for each K (number of subpopulations), with K = 1 to K = 8 examined. An admixture model (mixed ancestry from multiple populations was allowed) was used along with uncorrelated allele frequencies between subpopulations. We used StructureHarvester to identify the optimum K using the Evanno method ( Earl and vonHoldt, 2012 and Evanno et al., 2005). CLUMPP was used to integrate results across runs per K ( Jakobsson and Rosenberg, 2007).<br />3. Results<br />3.1. Validation of interspecific origin of hybrid populations<br /><br />We utilized flow cytometry to compare the genome sizes of hexaploid H. tuberosus and diploid H. annuus to the hybrid offspring. A portion of the putative hybrid individuals may have resulted from inadvertent self-pollinations or mating between H. tuberosus individuals. Therefore, this analysis served to identify the individuals that were true interspecific hybrids (i.e., tetraploid plants).<br /><br />The estimated 1C genome size of H. annuus is ∼3.3 pg of DNA ( Bennett and Leitch, 2010). The two diploid annual parents used in the present study exhibited similar values, as HA 89 and HA 434 were measured at 3.45 pg and 3.60 pg, respectively ( Table 2). The average 1C genome size among the 18 H. tuberosus accessions was 14.52 pg, higher than the previously reported value of 12.55 pg ( Bennett and Leitch, 2010).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 2.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C DNA content ranges (pg) for Helianthus annuus and H. tuberosis accessions in the perennial sunflower breeding program and their F1, intermated F1 (IM1F1), and F1 from first backcross to H. annuus (BC1F1) derivatives that were tested and literature values.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accession&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No. individuals&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Range (pg)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mean (pg)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mean (Gb)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reported Value (pg)†<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HA89&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;108&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.14–3.82&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.45&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.37&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.78–3.98<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HA434&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;98&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.15–4.11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.52&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.78–3.98<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helianthus tuberosus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12.95–15.58*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14.52&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14.20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12.55‡<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;187&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.92–16.92&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.98&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.76&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IM1F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;170&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.53–19.03&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.29&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BC1F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;120&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.89–6.28&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.45&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.33&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NA<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; †<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reported values are all based flow cytometry for H. annuus and on Feuglen Densitometry for H. tuberosus, and were reported in Bennett and Leitch (2010). Conversion to base pairs was done using the equation from Doležel et al. (2007).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‡<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feugelin microdensitometry was used in the initial measurement, which may underestimate genome size in the presence of secondary metabolites (Doležel et al., 2007).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variation in genome size was greater among the hexaploid H. tuberosus individuals than among H. annuus, similar to high ploidy accessions of switchgrass ( Costich et al., 2010).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table options<br /><br />Based on flow cytometry measurements, the expected genome size for an average tetraploid hybrid was approximately 9 pg. The vast majority of the putative F1 hybrid plants (166 out of 187) exhibited flow cytometry readings near this value, indicating that these are likely true interspecific hybrids (Fig. 1). However, 21 putative F1 hybrids (12.2%) had DNA content equal or greater than the reported 1 C genome size for H. tuberosus (12.55 pg). We inferred that these plants were hexaploid, resulting from either self-pollinated or intermated H. tuberosus plants. These plants were excluded from further analysis.<br /><br />Full-size image (24 K)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship between observed and predicted F1 genome size based on the average of the two parents for each cross. Individuals that had a genome size above 12 pg were considered to be hexaploid and were discarded from phenotypic analysis.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure options<br /><br />In the intermated F1 (IM1F1) population, nearly all plants (167 out of 170) contained approximately 9 pg DNA per cell, indicating that these plants maintained a tetraploid chromosome number. Three individuals (1.7%) in the IM1F1 population had a genome size outside the expected range (two appeared pentaploid, the other octoploid) and were also excluded from the phenotypic analysis. All BC1F1 plants were triploid and displayed annual habit. As no perennial plants were recovered, the BC1F1 population was not investigated further.<br />3.2. Trait evaluation in interspecific H. annuus x H. tuberosus F1 populations<br /><br />Generally, F1 individuals were intermediate to the domesticated annual and the wild parents for each trait examined, with most traits having wide distributions but being more similar to the wild parent (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1). Some traits in the F1 hybrids were more similar to the domesticated H. annuus (e.g., seed traits), and others were more similar to wild H. tuberosus ( Fig. 2 and Table 3; Supplementary Fig. 1). For most traits, a few F1 individuals closely resembled the domesticated phenotype. Across environments yield traits were positively correlated and tuber traits were correlated with each other (Supplementary Table 2). Seed weight and number were not correlated with tuber traits (Supplementary Table 2). Correlations from individual environments were different from the correlation pattern across all environments (Supplementary Table 2). For individual traits, heritability in the F1 varied from 0.05 to 0.76 indicating differing selective potential for different traits in this breeding program (Supplementary Table 3). For most traits, heritability was similar across environments, but varied for seed weight and tuber weight (Supplementary Table 3). We observed individuals that were consistently superior for seed and agronomic traits compared to the wild H. tuberosus parent in all environments, particularly we observed increases in head size and seed yield.<br /><br />Full-size image (92 K)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trait distributions in the F1 hybrids.

Table options<br /><br />F1 plants typically flowered earlier than H. tuberosus ( Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 4). Three architecture traits were measured: branching type, spreading ability, and head number. The F1 hybrids were not statistically different from H. tuberosus for spread ability but were for branching type. While branching type was significantly different (less branching) between F1 and H. tuberosus, it still was not unbranched like the domestic H. annuus ( Fig. 2). F1 plant spreading and head number varied greatly between environments. Hybrids displayed fewer total flowers, but not the single head type preferred in H. annuus cultivars. Three tuber traits were examined: tuber number, total tuber weight and individual tuber weight. The F1 hybrids had greater tuber number, individual and total tuber weight than H. tuberosus ( Table 3).<br /><br />The F1 families were different from their wild H. tuberosus parents for most yield traits ( Table 3 and Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 4). Head size exhibited a wide phenotypic range both within plants and among families. The largest heads among the F1 individuals were 5-6 times bigger in diameter than H. tuberosus ( Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1). The majority of F1 plants had few seeds (0-25), yet some individual F1 plants yielded ten times this amount. There was differential shattering or predation among environments that likely increased seed yield variability.<br />3.3. Trait evaluation in the IM1F1 population<br /><br />F1 individuals were intermated to generate an IM1F1 population. We continued to observe improvements for yield traits in this generation, despite the absence of artificial selection pressure in choosing parents for the IM1F1. However, differences in pollen fertility may indicate that inadvertent selection for viability of pollen occurred. In 2010, 55 IM1F1 plants were evaluated for head and seed traits. Three plants were ranked in the top 10% for largest head diameter, seed weight, and seed per ten head for the IM1F1 population. The largest head was 20% larger than any head observed in the F1. Positive correlations between head size, seed weight, and seed per head were maintained. The best IM1F1 individuals exhibited numerically higher values than the best F1 individuals for all seed traits, indicating the potential power of a recurrent selection program.<br /><br />While all F1 individuals exhibited perenniality through tuber sprouting, the IM1F1 population segregated for the perennial habit. In the winter of 2009-2010, 71 plants were screened for winter survival with 77% (55) surviving, which did not differ from a 3:1 ratio (p = 0.89) but did differ from other tested ratios ( Table 4). Initially, it was unknown whether this was a result of segregation for tuber production, tuber survival (winter hardiness), or both. To confirm that the 3:1 segregation result was largely the result of tuber production segregation, 151 additional IM1F1 plants were grown in the greenhouse during the winter of 2010-2011 and screened for tuber production. All control H. tuberosus plants and 67% (104) of the IM1F1 produced tubers. Again, the IM1F1 segregation did not significantly differ from a 3:1 (p = 0.39) ratio ( Table 4). In 2011-2012, we grew these 104 tuber-bearing plants in the field at Rosemount and found that 51% died, largely attributable to winter kill. Detailed evaluation of tuber winter hardiness has not been conducted to identify the factors involved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 4.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Segregation ratios for tuber production in IM1F1 plants.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3:1 ratio for tuber production&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9:7 ratio for tuber production<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Winter 2009–2010&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Winter 2010–2011&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Winter 2009–2010&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Winter 2010–2011<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants examined&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;71&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;151&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;71&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;151<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observed number of tuber producers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;55&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;104&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;55&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;104<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expected number of tuber producers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;53.25&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;113.25&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;39.94&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;84.94<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chi-square value&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.019&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.75&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.63&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.24<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-Value&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.89&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.39&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.02&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.04<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table options<br /><br />3.4. Parental diversity<br /><br />Sixteen SSR markers were used to examine the genetic diversity in the parents of the Minnesota perennial sunflower breeding program and a subset of the accessions in the GRIN collection. Although diversity measures showed a moderate level of diversity (Supplementary Table 5), they are difficult to interpret due to complexities related to polyploidy (Brown and Young, 2000, Luo et al., 2006, Akhunov et al., 2010 and Stift et al., 2008). However, useful estimates of the relatedness of the breeding material to other germplasm can be made. The parents of the Minnesota breeding program did not cluster with the accessions from the GRIN collection (Fig. 3). RST indicated that the Minnesota population is moderately different than the GRIN accessions when grouped as a population (Supplementary Table 6). Structure analysis identified two subpopulations (K = 2) as the best fit, essentially dividing the Minnesota and GRIN accessions ( Fig. 3a) ( Pritchard et al., 2000 and Evanno et al., 2005). This was similar to the interpretation obtained from examining a phylogenetic tree based on genetic distance ( Fig. 3b). This indicates that the 18 H. tuberosus individuals used to develop the F1 and IM1F1 populations represent a relatively narrow sampling of the genetic pool of the species.<br /><br />Full-size image (85 K)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 3. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) Structure clustering based on the same 16 SSR markers with colors indicating different sub-populations (light gray indicating membership in the GRIN collection and dark gray indicating membership in the Minnesota wild collected material), partial coloring indicated mixed ancestry for an individual accession, with percent membership indicated by the axis.

Discussion<br />4.1. Prospects and limitations for perennial grain breeding<br /><br />The combination of traits comprising the perennial Helianthus seed crop ideotype includes seed and head traits contributing to high seed yield (high pollen fertility, high seed weight, large head size), plant architecture traits enabling uniform seed maturity (no branching and one central flower, or all heads having synchronous flowering), and tuber traits contributing to a manageable perennial habit (low tuber number, high individual tuber weight). Therefore, the perennial ideotype is the domesticated phenotype with the addition of perenniality. This ideotype for the initial perennial sunflower lines would be targeted toward marginal landscapes with high potential for degradation to maximize the environmental benefit. In addition, the lines could be used as a trap crop near production fields to help mitigate bird predation.<br /><br />The straightforward way to produce a perennial sunflower would be to backcross perennial habit into annual sunflower. Based on our investigation, we found that when F1 plants (tetraploid) were crossed with H. annuus plants (diploid), weak annual triploid plants were generated. This was also found in other species where backcrossing approaches have generally led to a loss of perenniality, so breeding programs have focused on domestication of interspecific hybrids or wild relatives ( Cox et al., 2010). Therefore, we refocused our efforts on selection and intermating of the best F1 individuals.<br /><br />From a physiological perspective, there is reason for optimism regarding our refocused efforts on selecting for domestication phenotypes in the intermated individuals. With the potential to allocate resources to both sexual and asexual reproduction, the expectation is that both types of reproduction will compete for resources (Darwin, 1876 and Van Noordwijk and De Jong, 1986). Empirical studies have identified negative (Westley, 1993) and positive phenotypic correlations (Cheplick, 1995) between sexual and asexual reproduction, with occasional genetic correlations as well as large environmental effects on resource allocation (Westley, 1993 and Piquot et al., 1998). However, we observed few negative correlations between tuber and seed traits with total seed weight being significantly positively correlated with tuber traits; this may be due to the resource rich environments in which the plans were grown (Cheplick, 1995). The wide phenotypic distributions (with some favorable types and transgressive segregants) in the F1 hybrids described here indicate that selection for both perenniality and yield in this population may be possible. Furthermore, wider ranges were observed in the IM1F1 compared to the F1 for some traits, indicating that recurrent selection on intermated materials may successfully take advantage of the wide genetic variation for further improvement. Key improvement targets for the breeding program are summarized in Table 5.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 5.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving the University of Minnesota perennial sunflower breeding program toward the perennial ideotype.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trait&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ideotype&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elite F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;IM1F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Potential<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowering time&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Early to intermediate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Resembled the domestic type in flowering time&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Flowering was similar to F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Flowering time was identified as an important domestication trait with initial domestication favoring early flowering (Blackman et al., 2011) and is already starting to resemble the ideotype<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Flowering time during the year&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan architecture&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• No branching&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Some branching&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Less branching than F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Extreme individuals and moderate heritability for architecture traits indicate that selection for improved types is possible<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Single head&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Multiple heads&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Fewer flowers than F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Flower number may be under relatively simple genetic control (Hockett and Knowles, 1970 and Putt, 1964)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Minimal Spread&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Exhibited heterosis for biomass leading to more spread and vigor relative to the H. tuberosus plants&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Variation similar to the F1 but had more extreme types for plant spread&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Spreading of interspecific hybrids showed variation, including types that did not spread indicating progress toward the ideotype<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuber traits&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Few tubers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• High tuber numbers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Variation similar to the F1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Tuber number had high narrow sense heritability, indicating that genetic effects may be easy to select for and that it may be easy to select individuals with low tuber number<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Intermediate tuber yield high&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Heterosis for tuber yield&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Not all F1 may be persistent and genotypes can be selected for decreased weed potential as individuals with a phenotype similar to the perennial ideotype were identified<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Individual tuber weight&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Tubers were generally small&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • This would be ideal because larger tubers would reliably germinate but if numbers were low there would likely be minimal spread&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yield traits&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Large headed like H. annuus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Low family means compared to the range for yield traits with many individual outliers, similar to interspecific perennial rice populations (Sacks et al., 2006a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Variation similar to the F1 but had more extreme individuals&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• There was no relationship between pollen fertility and perennial traits, mirroring studies in interspecific rice (Sacks et al., 2006a)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Large number of seed per head&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Pollen fertility was not a goo predictor of yield, likely as here is little cost to the plant, as increased pollen production can account for low viability<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • High total yield&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• In the F1 tuber and yield traits were not correlated indicating that there may not be an antagonistic relationship between pereniality and yield<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • High individual seed weight&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Head size had a high narrow sense heritability indication selection for larger heads may progress rapidly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • High pollen fertility&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• The low narrow sense heritability in seed weight indicates that many genes and/or genes with large non-additive effects are involved in its control (Fehr, 1991).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;• Progress has been made toward he perennial ideotype<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table options<br /><br />From a genetic perspective, the situation is more nuanced and depends on currently unknown factors. It is attractive to consider the past utilization of the Helianthus wild germplasm as an indicator of future success for introgressing perenniality. Additionally, Baack et al. (2008) made the promising observation that selection for domestication traits proceeds rapidly in progeny from domestic × wild annual Helianthus matings. We have observed this first hand, as improvements in seed and head traits were achieved while maintaining perennial habit after one generation of intermating. However, our breeding design is unique in that it uses interploidy hybridization and maintains the populations as polyploids. The ability to drive the phenotypic traits toward the ideotype using our intermating scheme will depend on the rate at which the H. tuberosus genetic material can be purged from the genome (and replaced by the H. annuus genetic material), while maintaining perenniality. There are two factors that will determine this limitation: (1) the amount of H. tuberosus genetic material that is required for perenniality and (2) the meiotic pairing behavior of homeologous chromosomes.<br /><br />Best case scenarios require that very little H. tuberosus genetic material is necessary to confer perenniality in the intermated progeny. This would reduce the linkage drag associated with introgressing the perenniality loci. Furthermore, an ideal scenario would presume that the A1, A2, and Bt sub-genomes of H. tuberosus are all capable of pairing with the H. annuus chromosomes. In this case, it would be possible to continuously increase the proportion of the H. annuus genome with each successive generation of intermating possibly increasing the speed of producing the ideotype. However, if the Bt genome exclusively pairs with the H. annuus chromosomes, then it would be impossible to purge the A1 and A2 chromosomes, regardless of the number of generations of intermating. In this case, all of the intermated tetraploid plants would contain at least 50% H. tuberosus genome, severely limiting the progress that could be made toward achieving the ideotype.<br /><br />If conventional breeding is severely limited by these genetic limitations, it may be possible that genetic transformation could provide an avenue to create a plant more similar to the ideotype. If the gene(s) underlying the seemingly simple segregation in the IM1F1 for tuber development (discussed in the next section) can be identified, they may be cloned and transformed for this purpose. It is unclear if such an approach would be acceptable to consumers, and the approach is likely to be subject to regulatory assessment due to the invasive potential of transgenic sunflowers. The intriguing question also arises whether coupling genetic transformation to ecosystem services will make the technology more palatable.<br />4.2. Segregation of perenniality in Helianthus IM1F1 and other species<br /><br />Variation in perennial traits (including the lack of perenniality) has been reported in populations derived from perennial rice, sorghum, wheat grass, and teosinte crossed with their annual crop relatives (Hu et al., 2003, Murphy et al., 2009, Lammer et al., 2004, Westerbergh and Doebley, 2004, Sacks et al., 2003a, Sacks et al., 2003b, Sacks et al., 2006a and Sacks et al., 2006b). In the present study, all Helianthus F1 plants were perennial and the IM1F1 population segregated approximately 3:1 for tuber production with tuber survival (over-wintering ability) differing among seasons. This finding implies that it may be relatively simple to identify the genetic factors that are most essential for perennial organ development.<br /><br />Segregation for perenniality in the IM1F1 has several potential explanations (Fig. 4). The first and simplest explanation is that a single dominant gene in the H. tuberosus genome is necessary for tuberization ( Fig. 4b), but it is probably not that simple because the BC1F1 generations did not produce tubers. Second, segregation for perenniality may result from sub-genome dosage effects. It has been observed that interspecific hybrids with genomic composition less than 50% of the perennial parent rarely maintain pereniality ( Cox et al., 2002 and Cox et al., 2010). This suggests that there may be a stoichiometric regulatory balance, and that certain proportions are necessary for phenotypic stability ( Birchler and Veitia, 2001 and Birchler et al., 2001). This scenario is supported by the lack of perenniality in the BC1F1 individuals, which had a reduced relative proportion of the H. tuberosus sub-genomes ( Fig. 4c). This may present a problem as we continue to attempt to enrich for rare recombination events to purge as much as possible of the H. tuberosus genome, but currently we see improvement in phenotypes. Thirdly, the interspecific hybrid may be viewed as a neopolyploid, which may cause multivalent pairing, homoeologous recombination, aneuploidy, and/or large de novo structural variants ( Chester et al., 2012 and Tate et al., 2009). If this scenario is true genome stability may be increased by intermating for several generations. While these phenomena may result in inconsistent transmission for many traits, including perenniality, imposing selection may lead to more stable plants allowing us to identify those individuals that have the perennial ideotype.<br /><br />Full-size image (47 K)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 4. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hypothetical models of chromosome segregation that lead to perennial and annual progeny. (A) H. annuus × H. tuberosus hybridization leads to 100% perenniality. White indicates the H. annuus chromosomes; chromosomes from the three sub-genomes of H. tuberosus are indicated by solid black (A1), checkered (A2) or lined (Bt) patterns. (B) Subsequent intermating of F1 hybrids yields progeny that segregate for perenniality. Dark gray background indicates the genotype for perennial plants and light gray indicates the genotype for annual plants. Two models are shown to explain the ∼3:1 segregation pattern. The model on the left associates perennialty with the dosage of the H. tuberosus chromosomes relative to the H. annuus chromosomes (annual plants exhibit a higher dosage of H. annuus chromosomes). The model on the right associates perennialty with a single factor sufficient for tuber production segregating from one of the H. tuberosus sub-genomes. In this example, the single factor resides on one of the A1 chromosomes. (C) Backcrossing the F1 hybrid with H. annuus yields progeny that are all annual. This result is consistent with both the dosage model or the single segregating factor model described in part (B).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure options<br /><br />5. Conclusion<br /><br />Based on the examination of the H. tuberosus parents, the F1, IM1F1 and BC1F1, hybridization followed by selection for domestication traits appears feasible to improve Helianthus for use as a perennial oil-seed crop. The development of perennial oil-seed is a long term endeavor; however, there are checkpoints along the way such as use as a trap crop that provide value during the development. As these checkpoints are reached new agronomic and disease challenges (likely due to the lack of crop rotation) will need to be addressed in order for perennial crops to be adopted. In addition, much can be learned about the biology of perennial habit and about interspecific hybridization. The intermating (IM1F1) approach exhibited the greatest potential, as domestication traits were improved in the IM1F1 while maintaining perenniality in a high proportion of the population. The improved phenotypic traits in the IM1F1 may be indicative of the loss of wild chromosomes or portions of chromosomes in favor of domestic chromosomes. Therefore, recurrent intermating and selection of advanced intermated lines appears to be a promising approach for further improvement. Perenniality may segregate in a relatively simple way even if the underlying genetics are complex. Our data indicate that we have started our program with limited diversity, but despite this we have seen gains in initial generations ( Table 5; Supplementary Table 4). If we do not see continued gains, the addition of more parents to the University of Minnesota perennial sunflower breeding program would likely be beneficial. There is potential to eventually develop a perennial H. annuus-like plant that produces tubers and yield grain consistently over the life of a stand, leading to a crop that produces ecosystem services while having a commercially viable yield.<br />Acknowledgments<br /><br />We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the Masonic Cancer Center, a comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, supported in part by P30 CA77598.

Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench is the fifth most important grain crop in the world in terms of production [1]. Sorghum almum Parodi as well as Sudangrass, S. bicolor ssp. drummondii (Nees ex. Steud.) de Wet &amp; Harlan, and its hybrids with S. bicolor have been used for decades as high biomass forage and hay crops [2, 3]. Recently, several forms of S. bicolor have been evaluated as candidates for both liquid and solid biofuel feedstocks [4–8]. This species behaves as an annual in temperate climates and as a weak perennial in tropical and subtropical climates where temperatures do not drop below freezing. Other Sorghum species, notably Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. and Sorghum propinquum (Kunth) Hitchc., are strongly rhizomatous perennials [9].<br /><br />Perennial sorghum cropping systems offer agroecological benefits not present in annual row crop production such as increased soil organic carbon, reduced soil erosion, reduced inputs requirements, and higher net energy return [10–14]. Land use change could be minimized in such systems through the utilization of marginal croplands or abandoned grasslands. In 2007, there were 614 million acres (248 million ha) of rangeland and pastureland, 36 million acres (15 million ha) of cropland used for pasture, and 37 million acres (15 million ha) of idle cropland in the USA alone [15] that could be utilized in perennial sorghum cropping systems. Improved overwintering ability would be a critical component of perennial sorghum systems and relates directly to the production of rhizomes [16, 17], modified underground stems that act as storage and propagation organs [18, 19]. Although rhizome depth of growth and derived tiller number have been implicated in overwintering ability [16, 20], factors such as rhizome assimilate composition remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, it is unknown if genetic diversity in sorghum rhizome assimilate composition exists. Carbohydrates, primarily glucose, sucrose, starch, and dextrins, vary in rhizomes throughout the growing season depending on the plant’s growth stage with levels decreasing during sprouting and seed formation [21–23]. After seed maturation, sucrose concentrations in the rhizomes increase significantly, which is believed to be beneficial for overwintering [21, 22]. Additional assimilates associated with energy storage increase in response to environmental factors. For example, varying degrees of correlation between starch content and cold tolerance have been reported [24–27], and high concentrations of sucrose have been correlated with cold tolerance in several species [24, 28]. The above findings indicate that predictive correlations between rhizome composition and overwintering ability may occur in Sorghum species.<br /><br />The determination of rhizome composition requires costly wet chemistry analysis, which makes it impractical to thoroughly analyze all the genotypes necessary for genetic mapping studies and large-scale field experiments. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a possible alternative to wet-chemical analysis, measuring near-infrared light absorbance and/or reflectance within sample tissues. In order to use NIRS, a calibration equation must be created for the specific tissue type and the compositional measurements desired [29]. This is accomplished by analyzing a range of samples using both wet chemistry analysis and NIRS and then correlating the results from the two analyses. Once the calibration equation is loaded into the NIRS software, compositional predictions can be made quickly at a comparatively low cost. NIRS equations have been developed for various sorghum grain, leaf, and steam components [8, 29–31], but none have been reported for sorghum rhizome composition or rhizomes in most other species. However, a calibration equation does exist for total nonstructural carbohydrates in peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) rhizomes [32]. Development of sorghum rhizome composition calibration equations would greatly facilitate high throughput phenotyping of rhizome compositional traits for both sorghum breeding and research programs.<br /><br />The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize rhizome assimilate composition and its relationship to overwintering ability in a collection of S. halepense and Sorghum hybrid genotypes, (2) determine if significant genetic variation for rhizome composition exists in this germplasm, and (3) determine the usefulness of NIRS in predicting the levels of compositional assimilates in sorghum as a potential high-throughput method for determining rhizome composition.<br />Experimental<br />Plant Materials and Field Trials<br /><br />Plant material used for this study consisted of nine S. halepense genotypes that were collected from several locations in Texas, USA, one genotype collected in North Carolina, USA, and one genotype from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System [33] (Table 1). These plants were propagated vegetatively during the spring of 2010 to have sufficient plant material for field planting in autumn of 2010.<br />Table 1<br /><br />Sorghum halepense and Sorghum hybrid genotypes used in the study and their origins<br /><br />Genotype<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Species<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Origin<br /><br />09NC01<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />S. halepense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 36.33521° N, 80.79339° W<br /><br />09TX05<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.63848° N, 96.45306° W<br /><br />09TX06<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />S. halepense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.63848° N, 96.45306° W<br /><br />09TX07<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />S. halepense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.21450° N, 97.13771° W<br /><br />09TX08<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />S. halepense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.03131° N, 97.30483° W<br /><br />09TX10<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.63848° N, 96.45306° W<br /><br />09TX11<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 30.21553° N, 97.31498° W<br /><br />09TX13<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 29.90665° N, 96.91128° W<br /><br />09TX14<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 29.90665° N, 96.91128° W<br /><br />09TX15<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorghum spp.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Collected: 29.90665° N, 96.91128° W<br /><br />09TX20<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />S. halepense<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />USDA GRIN PI#271615 (country of origin: India)<br /><br />Winter survival trials were conducted at Commerce (33°11′ N, 95°55′ W) and College Station (30°32′ N, 96°26′ W), Texas, USA in 2010 and 2011. At both locations, genotypes were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The plots at Commerce were located on the Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce Research Farm, and the plants were grown in columns of soil inside Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes 1 m in length and 15.2 cm in diameter (see below). The tubes were placed into 92-cm deep holes that were dug with a power take-off (PTO)-driven auger attached to a tractor. The distance between soil columns at Commerce was 1.8 m to allow for the movement of the tractor between plants.<br /><br />Two experimental plantings were established at the Texas A&amp;M University Research Farm near College Station. One was similar to the plot at Commerce except that, at College Station, the tubes were submerged into the soil to a depth of only 46 cm and the distance between rows and columns within a row was 1 m. The soil level of the columns at Commerce was even with the soil level of the field, but the soil level in the columns at College Station was 46 cm above the field soil level. This placement was intended to expose the upper half of the soil columns at College Station to more extreme temperatures. For the second College Station planting, the plants were transplanted directly into the soil at a distance of 2 m between plants within a row and 2 m between rows. Because one College Station experiment was conducted in soil columns and the second was planted directly into soil in the field, they were considered as different experimental environments.<br />Column Construction<br /><br />The soil columns were made by longitudinally cutting 3 m lengths of 15.2 cm diameter PVC pipe into two equal halves. The halves were cut into 1-m sections. At the lower end of each half-tube, three evenly spaced 0.3-cm holes were drilled and threaded with galvanized wire, which crossed at the center to create a web-like design. The two pipe halves were then placed together and secured with duct tape at locations along the length of the tube. A piece of burlap cloth was folded several times and placed on top of the wire web at the bottom of each column for the purpose of retaining the soil while allowing water percolation.<br /><br />Tubes used at both locations were filled with Westwood silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Udifluventic Haplustepts) that was taken to a depth of 15.2 cm from the Texas A&amp;M University Research Farm. The tubes were filled with the soil, tamped on the ground, and then watered overnight using a soaker hose to insure similar soil compaction across all tubes. Following watering, soil compaction caused a drop in the soil level in each tube, and soil was added to bring the soil level to ∼7.6 cm below the top of each tube resulting in a 92-cm column of soil in each tube.<br />Planting and Sampling<br /><br />For all studies, plants were vegetatively propagated via rhizome cuttings in March of 2010. Six cuttings from each genotype (three replicates with two plants each; one for autumn sampling and one for spring sampling) were used per experiment. After a few months of growth, plants were trimmed approximately 15 cm above the soil surface and transplanted into soil columns (on 16 August) or the field environment (on 8 July). At the time of planting, tiller number varied by genotype. Plants were fertilized at 84 kg N ha−1 as ammonium sulfate and watered. Columns designated for the autumn and spring sampling at Commerce were placed in the ground on 17 September. At College Station, the tubes designated for autumn were sampled directly without placement in the ground, while the tubes designated for spring sampling were placed into the ground on 12 November.<br /><br />For sampling, the tubes were removed from the ground and the tape binding the two halves of the tubes together was cut. The tubes were then opened, leaving the soil column intact. Each soil column was cut laterally into two equal halves 46 cm in length. Each half of the soil column was placed in a tub of water and the soil was washed away so rhizomes could be collected. The rhizomes were collected separately from the upper (0–46 cm) and lower (46–92 cm) halves of each column. However, only the samples taken from the upper half of each column were used for analyses because only a limited number of columns had rhizomes below 46 cm. Rhizome diameters were measured at the center of the first complete internode from the cut site. Samples were then placed into plastic bags and stored in a −80 °C freezer. Autumn sampling at Commerce took place on 22 October prior to the first freezing temperature, which occurred on 25 November. College Station columns were sampled on 10 November prior to the first freezing temperature on 27 November.<br /><br />Autumn sampling of the College Station field plots (planted directly in the soil rather than in tubes) took place on 17 and 19 November. The sampling procedure for the plants in the field differed from those in tubes. Above-ground vegetation of each plant was removed before the rhizomes were collected. Using a shovel, the whole plant was excavated. After the plant crown and rhizome mass were removed, the depth of the hole was increased to 46 cm and rhizomes were collected from the material removed from the hole. Rhizomes were not found below 46 cm; therefore, samples were not collected in the 46–92 cm depth range. The lack of rhizomes below 46 cm was likely due to a hard pan that was present approximately 41 cm below the soil surface. Rhizomes were washed and placed into plastic bags and stored on ice until they were transferred into a −80 oC freezer. Since the sampling method was destructive, the remaining plants of each genotype were left in the field to be sampled the following spring. Just prior to spring rhizome sampling, several traits associated with overwintering ability and spring regrowth (the presence of new leaf material in the spring) were measured for both the field-planted and column-grown plants at both locations. For the College Station field site (not in columns) a 1-m2 quadrat centered on the primary tillers of each plant was used to count the number of green shoots and the number of leaves. These data were collected at College Station on 2 March 2011. Spring regrowth measurements were made on the plants growing in the soil column on the day of sampling, which was 1 April at College Station and 7 April at Commerce.<br /><br />Spring sampling at both locations was conducted in the same manner as the previous autumn sampling, with a few exceptions. Only live rhizome tissue was collected in the spring because some rhizomes had freeze damage. Rhizomes considered “live” had a healthy/white appearance and were rigid.<br />Rhizome Composition Analysis<br /><br />To prepare the rhizome samples for analysis, the rhizomes were placed into mesh bags and dried in a lyophilizer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) for at least 3 days at −40 °C. All fibrous root material was removed from the rhizomes. Samples were then ground to a 1-mm particle size using first a coarse grinder and then a UDY Cyclone mill (Udy Corp, Fort Collins, CO, USA). The ground tissue was placed into glass vials and stored in cold storage.<br /><br />Tissue samples were analyzed by Dairy One (Utica, NY, USA) using wet chemistry analysis for crude protein (CP), crude fat (fat), starch, water soluble carbohydrates (WSCs), and ethanol-soluble carbohydrates (ESCs). WSC consists primarily of glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, lactose, and fructans, whereas ESC is made up of primarily glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, and lactose. An estimate of fructan concentration was therefore obtained by determining the concentration difference between WSC and ESC for each sample.<br />Assimilate Analysis via NIR<br /><br />Prior to wet chemistry analysis, the samples were scanned with a Thermo Scientific Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with a setting of 64 coaveraged scans per sample and a resolution of 4 cm−1 between wavelengths 4,000 and 9,999 cm−1 using the OMNIC 8 software suite (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). To insure the tissue was packed uniformly into the vials, they were placed side by side in a small box and tamped on a lab bench 15 times prior to scanning. NIRS reflectance spectral data was converted to absorbance and combined with the wet chemistry analysis data in TQ Analyst software (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to create prediction equations. Approximately one third of the data were used as a validation set and the other two thirds were used as a calibration set. Many different standard mathematical treatments were applied over different spectral ranges before selecting the treatment with the highest performance index. The performance index validates the NIRS curve by measuring how accurately a calibrated method can quantify independent validation samples. A value of 0 reflects no prediction while a maximal value of 100 reflects perfect prediction.<br />Statistical Analysis<br /><br />Data were analyzed for genotype, environment, and genotype by environment (GxE) effects using a PROC MIXED statement with environment, genotype, and GxE as random variables in SAS version 9.1 [34]. The variation for each effect was then divided by the total variance to get a percentage of total variance. The two sampling dates (autumn or spring) were not comparable and analyzed separately but with otherwise identical PROC MIXED analyses including all three environments. Correlations between CP, fat, starch, WSC, ESC, and overwintering capability were determined using a PROC CORR statement. These correlation analyses were carried out on all experiments and sampling dates individually. In addition, the two soil column environments were also analyzed jointly because of their similar design, using a PROC CORR statement. Logistic regression models were created for the prediction of spring regrowth (overwintering ability) based on autumn assimilate composition data using JMP® Software, Version 9 [35].<br />Results and Discussion<br />Genotype and Genotype by Environment Effects<br /><br />Both locations were exposed to subfreezing temperatures and provided suitable environments for screening. Genotypic effects on rhizome assimilate concentrations varied between and among environments and sampling dates (Table 2). Measurements of spring regrowth also show some genotype effect. No single genotype consistently produced the highest concentration of any given assimilate across all environments. Therefore, GxE effects were large for multiple assimilates in both the spring and autumn sampling dates (Table 2). The large environmental variation observed for some assimilates and sampling dates demonstrate that absolute values were not comparable across environments. From our findings, it appears that although many factors affect rhizome composition [36], screening for genetic components can identify useful diversity.<br />Table 2<br /><br />Percentage of the total variance explained by genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype by environment (GxE) effects<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Trait<br /><br />G (%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />E (%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />GxE (%)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Error (%)<br /><br />Autumn 2010<br /><br />CP<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4.6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />69.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />12.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />13.7<br /><br />Starch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />33.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />23.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />42.6<br /><br />WSC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />23.5<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />21.9<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />54.5<br /><br />ESC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />31.6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />6.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />8.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />53.9<br /><br />Fructans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />28.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />72.0<br /><br />Fat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />8.8<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />3.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />12.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />75.5<br /><br />Mean diameter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />29.4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />40.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />25.7<br /><br />Spring 2011<br /><br />CP<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />22.8<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />33.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />7.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />36.7<br /><br />Starch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />7.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />68.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />6.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />18.5<br /><br />WSC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />8.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />54.6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />17.6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />19.5<br /><br />ESC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />8.9<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />47.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />5.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />38.2<br /><br />Fructans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />34.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />29.4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />34.9<br /><br />Fat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />16.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />16.2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />67.5<br /><br />Mean diameter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />10.9<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />66.1<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />22.7<br /><br />Spring regrowth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />9.8<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />46.6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />17.7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />26.0<br /><br />Calculated from covariance parameter estimates in SAS PROC MIXED output. Results from both spring and autumn sampling dates shown<br /><br />Assimilate Concentrations and Overwintering<br /><br />Correlations and modeling between autumn assimilate concentrations and spring regrowth were used to estimate the effects that autumn assimilate accumulation may have on overwintering ability. Pearson correlation coefficients between regrowth and rhizome score were significant in both soil column environments, with the highest correlation coefficient being obtained when both column environments were combined (Tables 3 and 4). Plants were subjected to the most severe winter conditions at the College Station column environment because half of each column was above the soil level. This environment also had the most obvious differences between genotypes in spring regrowth. In the College Station soil column study, significant correlations were identified between spring regrowth and a number of assimilates from the autumn sampling date including starch, WSC, ESC, and fat (Table 3). Our best logistic regression model for this environment included only starch and fat, both of which were negatively correlated with spring regrowth (Table 5). WSC and ESC both had significant impacts when placed individually in a regression model meaning that their effects were unequal to zero, but their impacts were not significant when starch and fat were also included in the model. Our regression model had an R 2 of 0.49 and was significant at α = 0.001 level, indicating that all predictors in this model were correlated with post winter regrowth. Identical correlations conducted on the Commerce environment data revealed a single significant correlation between spring regrowth and autumn WSC concentration. Similar correlations and modeling approaches were used on the College Station field data; however, they did not yield significant differences. This is likely due to all field plants in that study surviving the winter resulting in lower statistical power, or it may be because above-ground biomass was removed several weeks prior to the spring sampling, and this may have caused translocation of nutrients away from rhizome tissue before harvest. Spring rhizome composition was significantly correlated with regrowth in the College Station column environment for WSC, fructans, and fat (Table 4).<br />Table 3<br /><br />Pearson correlation coefficients and their significance for autumn composition and spring regrowth (presence of new leaf material) from the Commerce and College Station tube environments<br /><br />Measurement<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;<br /><br />0.099<br /><br />One of the most notable differences between our data and that from previous studies is that we observed a negative correlation between fat content and overwintering ability. This finding is in contrast to observations on Arabidopsis above-ground growth [37] and what was hypothesized for the genus Paspalum based in part on studying rhizomes cut from plants and buried in the ground [38, 39]. Although our finding was unexpected, it is supported by significant correlations during both sampling dates for the College Station soil column studies. Most previous studies concerning the importance of higher fat content for cold tolerance have focused on actively photosynthetic tissues. These studies have used the plants' ability to continue normal metabolic functions during brief cold periods as their indicator of cold tolerance. In our study, we were concerned with nonphotosynthetic structures, rhizomes, and their ability to survive extended periods of low temperatures and produce shoots when the temperatures became warmer. It is possible that fat is beneficial for short-term cold tolerance, while being prejudicial to long term overwintering ability. In fact, if higher fat content allows a plant to continue to metabolize at lower temperatures, it may also cause the plant to use its stored energy during the winter months and deplete the plant of resources for regrowth the following year, therefore decreasing the rhizomes’ ability to successfully overwinter. Another possible explanation for our findings is that the ratio of different fatty acids may be more influential to cold tolerance than the total fat content [38, 40].<br /><br />Similar to fat, starch concentrations were negatively correlated with overwintering. This is in agreement with several previous studies [24, 41, 42]. Lower starch concentrations could reflect the breakdown of starch into sugars, which may be necessary for cold acclimation [25] and would be expected to decrease the freezing potential of the cells.<br /><br />Sugars, which were measured in our study using WSC (primarily glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, lactose, and fructans), were positively correlated with overwintering. Higher concentrations of sucrose have been found in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants that were selected for their overwintering ability [24] and similar trends were reported in centipedegrass, Eremochloa ophiruoides (Munro) Hackel [28]. Hoffman et al. [40] determined that the crowns of perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., accumulated WSC when the temperature was as low as 2 °C. Others have reported that total carbohydrate accumulation in the crowns of some plant species increased freezing tolerance [43, 44]. From our findings, it appears that the presence of WSC in sorghum rhizomes may be a useful indicator in predicting the overwintering ability of a plant or genotype.<br /><br />Fructans are one component of WSC, which are present in both cool and warm-season grasses [45]. ESC is a measurement of the same assimilates that are in WSC with the exception of fructans. Therefore, a determination and comparison of the carbohydrates in WSC and ESC can be used to calculate the amount of fructan present, which was significant in our study. This finding disagrees with what Pollock and Cairns [45] reported, but it suggests that genotypes that accumulate fructans may have a higher potential for over-wintering. Taken together, our data indicated that lower concentrations of fat and starch along with a higher concentration of WSC, ESC, and fructans were efficient indicators for rhizome overwintering ability within the College Station soil column environment.<br /><br />Rhizome mean diameter was also significant and negatively correlated with spring regrowth when both locations were analyzed together. This was surprising, as we had expected larger rhizomes to have greater energy for regrowth. However, correlations showed that these larger rhizomes had more starch than smaller ones, which further suggests that composition plays more of a role in overwintering ability than size.<br />NIRS for Prediction of Overwintering-Related Rhizome Composition<br /><br />NIRS analysis, if successful, could provide a less expensive and more rapid means of determining the composition of rhizomes than wet chemical analysis. Many NIRS models were fit for calibration in this study. The model that was eventually chosen incorporated all samples across all plots and locations and used Norris smoothing of five-unit segments and five-unit gaps. NIRS predictions for measured assimilates and performance index numbers (Table 6) indicate that NIRS is a robust and useful tool for predicting CP and starch as well as having potential for the prediction of WSC, ESC, and fat in sorghum rhizomes.<br />Table 6<br /><br />Calibration treatment and statistics for rhizome NIRS curve generated using all sampling dates<br /><br />Trait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />N<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />NIRS wavelengths (cm−1)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Resolution (cm−1)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Math treatmentsb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />R 2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />RMSECa<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Performance index (%)<br /><br />CP<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />166<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4,000–8,000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.93<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1,5,5,9<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.00<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.75<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />91.2<br /><br />Starch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />166<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4,000–8,000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.93<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1,5,5,7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.00<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />13.40<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />71.9<br /><br />WSC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />166<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4,000–8,000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.93<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1,5,5,8<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.97<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />16.40<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />44.2<br /><br />ESC<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />166<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4,000–8,000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.93<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1,5,5,7<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.88<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />20.50<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />64.0<br /><br />Fat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />166<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />4,000–9,999<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1.93<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1,5,5,5<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />0.81<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />5.32<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />52.5<br /><br />aRoot mean square of calibration (RMSEC) or the uncertainty of calibration<br /><br />bDerivative, segment length, gap, and factors used in the curve<br /><br />The NIRS model that we created will be a useful tool both for selecting winter-hardy parents in perennial sorghum breeding programs and for obtaining a better understanding of the assimilate fluxes that occur within sorghum rhizomes. In field experiments, winter freezing can often be excessively or insufficiently stringent to select a reasonable number of plants to advance, especially in the early stages of breeding programs. Selection based on composition profiles before freezing using NIRS could allow ideal selection intensity across environments. Because starch appears to be amenable to NIRS and displays the strongest correlation with spring regrowth in our most exposed environment, it would appear to be the best choice for assimilate selection. However, our data also indicate that starch concentrations are highly effected by environment and GxE (Table 2), making it less attractive than WSC and ESC. Perhaps the best, but also most expensive, approach would be to select for higher WSC and ESC while selecting for lower starch simultaneously. Another logical extension of this research would be to use a field-based NIRS system with a fiber-optic probe to take advantage of nondestructive screening of rhizomes in the field.<br />Conclusions<br /><br />Many factors affect rhizome composition, but our findings indicate a feasibility of selecting S. halepense and Sorghum spp. genotypes with greater overwintering capacity based on lower autumn fat and starch concentrations and greater WSC, ESC, and fructan concentrations within rhizomes. We also conclude that NIRS can be used to assist in the selection of perennial parent plants with improved overwintering ability while minimizing the need for costly wet chemical analyses. Two genotypes, 09TX05 and 09TX06, preformed best in terms of overwintering and regrowth at all locations and may therefore be useful in the breeding of perennial sorghum to be used for biofuel feedstocks.<br /><br />Open AccessThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.<br />References<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICRISAT (2004) Data and information. http://​www.​icrisat.​org/​crop-sorghum.​htm. 2011<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armah-Agyeman G, Loiland J, Karow R, Bean B (2002) Dryland cropping systems: Sudangrass.

One ecosystem-derived beneﬁt of perennial crops is their ability to use less fertilizer and a reduced carbon footprint associated with the over-wintering storage and remobilization of nutrients the following year (Jessup 2009). In addition, perennial cropping systems<br />123<br /><br />154<br />have the advantage of reduced soil erosion and are able to retain greater water reserves in the soil proﬁle than annual cropping systems (Piper and Kulakow 1994; Cox et al. 2002). Perennials take advantage of earlier and later seasonal growth than annual crops, which theoretically allows for a longer duration of solar energy capture. For these and other reasons, perennial systems have potential economic and environmental beneﬁts capable of facilitating the increased use of marginal soils for crop production (Cox et al. 2002).<br />The genus Sorghum is a desirable genetic model for investigating and utilizing perennialism because it consists of inter-fertile species that behave as both annuals and perennials in cold climates. Prior reports of perennialism in the genus Sorghum have largely focused on rhizome inheritance, a trait that is correlated and genetically linked to over-winter survival in sorghum (Ramaswamy 1973; Paterson et al. 1995; Yim and Bayer 1997; Jang et al. 2006; Jang et al. 2009). Rhizomes are modiﬁed underground stems that act as carbohydrate storage organs (Whitmire 2011) for many perennial plants. Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench is a tropical, diploid species (2n = 2x = 20) widely believed to lack rhizomes. It is grown as an annual crop in temperate environments, although rhizomes have been reported in at least one wild accession of S. bicolor (L.) Moench subsp. verticilliﬂorum (Steud.) de Wet ex Wiersema &amp; J. Dahlb. (Bhatti et al. 1960; Mouftah and Smith 1969). In contrast, Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. (2n = 4x = 40) is a weedy sorghum species, commonly known as Johnsongrass, with the ability to persist as a perennial in very cold climates (Warwick et al. 1986). Temperate-climate perennialism in S. halapense is correlated with rhizomatousness (Warwick and Black 1983; Warwick et al. 1984, 1986), and similar correlations have been found in other temperate-adapted perennial sorghum species (Paterson et al. 1995).<br />Sorghum propinquum (Kunth) Hitchc. (2n = 2x = 20) is a wild rhizomatous perennial sorghum found in Asia and the Paciﬁc islands (Magoon 1961). Sorghum propinquum, like S. bicolor, has only 20 chromosomes; however, its behavior during meiosis is dissimilar to S. bicolor in that the nucleolus is organized on a different chromosome (Magoon 1961). Sorghum propinquum is cross-compatible with S. bicolor, whereas S. halepense and S. bicolor are very difﬁcult to inter-mate (De Wet 1978). This fact thus makes S. propinquum a highly desirable source for the transfer of perennialism genes into cultivated sorghums.<br />123<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />In general, Sorghum rhizomes appear to be a critical factor inﬂuencing over-wintering, and the ability of rhizomes to survive seems to be due to the insulating effect of the soil (Warwick et al. 1986). The carbohydrate resources within a rhizome that over-winters are generally depleted during the following season, suggesting that rhizomes are temporary storage organs. In fact, many rhizomes disintegrate within 19–24 days after shoots emerge (McWhorter 1961; Monaghan 1979). Another indication that rhizomes are primarily a winter storage organ is that their fresh weights double within 4 days after ﬂowering under ideal conditions (McWhorter 1961; Monaghan 1979).<br />Both classical and molecular genetics studies have examined rhizome formation in several grass genera, including Digitaria, Oryza, Zea, and Sorghum (Hacker 1983; Tao et al. 2003; Sacks et al. 2003; Westerbergh and Doebley 2004; Paterson et al. 1995). In the genus Digitaria, it was concluded that rhizomatousness was controlled by two or more incompletely recessive genes (Hacker 1983). Rhizomatous and non-rhizomatous species in the genus Oryza have also been studied with varying results (Tao et al. 2003; Sacks et al. 2003). Tao et al. (2003) indicated that rhizomatousness is most likely controlled quantitatively by several quantitative trait loci (QTL) acting in an additive manner. Analysis of rhizome production and perennialism in wide crosses within the genus Zea also support a quantitative inheritance pattern (Westerbergh and Doebley 2004).<br />The genetics of sorghum rhizomes has been investigated more than most other species because of the interest in controlling weediness of Johnsongrass as well as in developing temperately-adapted perennial sorghum applications (Paterson et al. 1995). Classical genetic studies have shown that crossing the rhizomatous species S. halepense with a non-rhizomatous S. bicolor results in a 3:1 segregation ratio among the F2 progeny, possibly suggesting one major dominant gene controls rhizome formation (Yim and Bayer 1997). Hybrids between S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf. and S. halepense also exhibit a 3:1 segregation pattern, supporting the one dominant gene hypothesis (Ramaswamy 1973; Yim and Bayer 1997). However, additional studies have reported that rhizome formation is controlled by three dominant, additive genes (Monaghan 1979).<br />Using a diploid model, Paterson et al. (1995) concluded that rhizome formation in sorghum was a polygenic-inherited trait, as at least nine chromosomal<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />regions associated with quantitative variation in rhizome traits were detected. In rice, the Rhz2 and Rhz3 genes co-localize with many of the sorghum loci for rhizomes, indicating that the rhizome production mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved between these two genera (Hu et al. 2003). In this study, we sought to further investigate the relationship between rhizomatousness and over-wintering in sorghum and the longevity of rhizomatous sorghum lines based on years of re-growth. In addition, we sought to conﬁrm previously identiﬁed QTL for rhizome growth and over-wintering and increase the resolution of the region through targeted mapping.<br />Materials and methods<br />Field cultivation<br />On May 24, 2010, 130 F3:4 lines derived from hybrids between S. bicolor and S. propinquum (Paterson et al. 1995) were planted at College Station, TX, USA (30°320N, 96°260W) in a randomized complete block design. Standard sorghum agronomic practices were followed throughout the season with supplemental irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide applications made as necessary.<br />Greenhouse cultivation<br />A separate greenhouse study was also undertaken using the same plant materials, in order to corroborate the ﬁeld study. Seeds of the F4 lines were planted on November 11–12, 2011, in three replicates in 10-cm2 pots ﬁlled with Sun GroÒ Redi-earthÒ Plug and Seedling Mix (Sun Gro Horticulture, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and placed in a randomized complete block design. Plants were purposefully grown in small pots under the assumption that limited space would stress the plants and induce early maturation and therefore early rhizome development. Temperatures in the greenhouse were moderated, but ﬂuctuated between 16 and 27 °C. After 3 weeks of growth, seedlings were thinned to 4–6 plants per pot and allowed to continue growth.<br />Phenotyping<br />On November 29, 2010, near the time of the ﬁrst frost, phenotypic measurements were taken on the ﬁeld plots<br /><br />155<br />to determine the rhizomatousness of each line. These measurements were a modiﬁcation of those used by Paterson et al. (1995). Measurements included: (1) the number of living plants per line prior to ﬁrst frost; (2) the average number of rhizome-derived shoots (RDS) originating from each plant; and (3) the average distance of these shoots from the center of the row. Plants remained in the ﬁeld during the winter and were scored phenotypically for re-growth from rhizomes the following spring (March 31, 2011). Over-wintering ability was deﬁned as the presence of post-winter active re-growth within a plot from the crown or rhizomes, not seedlings. The surviving plants were allowed to grow throughout the summer of 2011 and over-winter in the ﬁeld for a second season during the winter of 2011–2012 in order to obtain data on the longevity of these lines. In the spring of 2012, the plants were again rated phenotypically for overwintering and rhizome parameters. Spring phenotyping involved a slight variation from fall measurements in that distance was measured from the center of the crown of each plant rather than the center of the row. Special care was taken to ensure that any seedlingderived plants were uprooted at an early stage so they would not be confused with rhizome-derived regrowth.<br />On April 10–11, 2012, greenhouse plants were removed from their pots and rated visually for the presence and abundance of rhizomes. Each pot was given a score from 1 to 10 based on the amount of rhizome growth. No rhizome growth was represented by a score of 1 and the maximum amount of rhizome growth was represented by a score of 10.<br />Statistical modeling for over-wintering ability<br />Several statistical models were created to test the hypothesis that over-wintering can be predicted based on rhizome growth. Three linear regressions, a logistical ANOVA, and a logistical regression model were tested. We used different combinations of RDS number per plot and RDS distance from the center of the row to create the models. Statistical models were created and tested using JMPÒ Software, Version 9 (JMP 2011).<br />DNA extraction<br />Leaf tissue was harvested from 10 to 20 plants of each line (except those with fewer surviving plants) and<br />123<br /><br />156<br />bulked by line. This tissue was frozen at -80 °C, and subsequently lyophilized for 3 days. A 6-mm hole punch was used to remove several discs of tissue from each lyophilized leaf sample, equaling about 0.17 g of dry tissue, and this was ground using stainless steel beads in a Talboys High Throughput Homogenizer (Troemner, Thorofare, NJ, USA). DNA was then extracted following a normal CTAB procedure (Doyle and Doyle 1987) and quantiﬁed using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Wilmington, DE, USA). Working samples of 50 lg/ml were then created by dilution with double deionized water. PCR was performed as previously described (Whitmire 2011; Jessup et al. 2012). The DNA fragments were separated using gel electrophoresis and scored as co-dominant markers following a published scoring procedure (Rodr´ıguez et al. 2001; Whitmire 2011). For electrophoresis, a MEGA-GEL (C.B.S. Scientiﬁc, Del Mar, CA, USA) high-throughput vertical unit was used. Gels had a ﬁnal concentration of 6 % acrylamide, 0.59 TBE (Tris–borate–EDTA) buffer, 0.07 % ammonium persulfate, and 0.08 % TEMED (tetramethylethylenediamine) (Wang et al. 2003; Whitmire 2011; Dowling 2011).<br />QTL and data analysis<br />Sixteen S. bicolor genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers mapping to a previously-reported rhizome QTL on sorghum chromosome SBI-01 were selected from a set of 329 SSRs (Whitmire 2011) and used for linkage analysis along with other selected markers (Table 1). According to the published S. bicolor genome sequence, these markers are distributed over a 15.71-Mb region within chromosome SBI-01 (Gramene 2011). The SSR markers were used for locus reﬁnement employing all 130 F3:4 lines described above. Marker and trait data were entered into QTL iciMapping (ICIM) version 3.1 software (Wang et al. 2012) for linkage analysis and QTL detection. For linkage analysis, marker data were entered into ICIM as a recombinant inbred line and grouped by a LOD score of 3.00 and a distance of 37.20 cM. Ordering was performed using the SER algorithm within the software package and then rippling with the LogL algorithm. After the ordering was complete, two of the markers were manually ordered to match the published S. bicolor genome (Gramene 2011). The QTL data was analyzed with an F3 population structure using biparental<br />123<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br /><br />Table 1 SSR markers used in ﬁnal QTL analysis with marker names, forward and reverse primer sequences, and location of marker on SBI-01<br /><br />Name<br /><br />Primer sequence<br /><br />Location<br /><br />SB062A SBL1B5I SBL1B5H SB0050A SBL1B6C SBL1B2F SBL1B6G pSB0088<br /><br />attaagggcagcatccaatc gattggcaagcgtgtgatac tggcttctctcctctcctgt ggatcacagcttcttgggtt caaggcgaacaagacatttg gtctctgccgtgaaaacaga agctagtgtgcataatgggc ggtgtcagtctttgacccct tactatgcgtttgggcgtag aaccgccaccgtagttaaag ataccaaagcggaggagcta catgtgaggaccgagtcaac agatcgaccgttaggtggac atgatgctacctcgagtccc cgcgcagaatcagaaaaagt catccaagttggcgtcttct<br /><br />53,605,463 54,856,700 54,856,700 58,089,588 61,357,000 62,191,006 68,002,200 69,318,196<br /><br />populations (BIP) mode. The ICIM-ADD (composite interval mapping) method was used with a step size of 0.5 cM and a probability in stepwise regression of 0.001. Deletion was selected as the means for dealing with missing phenotypic data and the LOD threshold was chosen through 1,000 permutations with a type I error level of 0.05. Single marker analysis (SMA) was also performed using the same number of permutations and error level.<br />Trait data was transformed prior to analysis in order to achieve normality of the residuals. All ﬁeld data was transformed using the natural log (ln) function except for RDS count for 2011 which was transformed using an ln(n ? 1) function (Paterson et al. 1995). Graphical representations of the linkage map and QTL presented in this paper were created using MapChart version 2.2 software (Voorrips 2002).<br />Results and discussion<br />Phenotyping and over-wintering<br />We sought to re-examine the relationship between over-wintering and rhizome formation in progeny from interspeciﬁc hybrids between cultivated sorghum<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />and S. propinquum, while also quantifying the survival of plants over multiple winters. During the ﬁrst winter season (2010–2011) in College Station, plants were exposed to a minimum temperature of -7 °C and 22 days of below-freezing temperatures (OCS 2012). As a consequence of the extreme temperatures for this locale (Fig. S1), only 25.2 % of the plots of F3:4 lines had surviving plants after the winter and only 8.2 % of the total plants within the family survived. By comparison, the winter of 2011–2012 was much milder, with a minimum temperature of -3 °C and freezing temperatures experienced on only 8 days (OCS 2012). Of the 33 plots of F3:4 lines that survived<br /><br />157<br />the ﬁrst winter, 82 % survived the second winter as well (26 of 33 plots).<br />The extreme temperatures and the associated high mortality rate (74.8 %) during the ﬁrst winter allowed powerful discrimination of over-wintering potential, much greater than that seen in previous studies utilizing germplasm from these interspeciﬁc hybrids (Paterson et al. 1995). Although drought conditions and wildlife pressure probably caused some confounding effects during the second winter, we saw no evidence of either stress during the ﬁrst winter, leading to the conclusion that the majority of selection pressure on our population was attributable to the cold<br /><br />Table 2 Parameter estimates from over-wintering regression models for S. bicolor 9 S. propinquum F4 hybrids<br /><br />LogRDS only model<br /><br />R2 = 0.25<br /><br />Term<br /><br />Estimate SE t-ratio<br /><br />Intercept LogRDS<br /><br />0.11 0.04 2.64 0.25 0.04 6.39<br /><br />LogAvgDist only model<br /><br />R2 = 0.14<br /><br />Term Intercept LogAvgDist<br />Whole model<br /><br />Estimate -0.1<br />0.28<br />R2 = 0.3<br /><br />SE t-ratio 0.09 -1.03 0.06 4.42<br /><br />Term<br /><br />Estimate SE t-ratio<br /><br />Intercept LogRDS LogAvgDist<br />Logistic regression model<br />Term<br /><br />-0.13 0.25 0.18<br /><br />0.08 -1.58 0.05 5.23 0.06 2.9<br /><br />R2 = 0.33<br /><br />Estimate SE v2<br /><br />Intercept LogRDS LogAvgDist (LogRDS-0.70) 9<br />(LogAvgDist– 1.31)<br />SE standard error * Signiﬁcant at alpha \0.05<br /><br />3.94 -2.06 -0.81 -2.06<br /><br />0.81 23.66 0.55 14.13 0.53 2.37 0.87 5.6<br /><br />Prob [ |t| 0.0094*<br />\0.0001*<br />Prob [ |t| 0.3032<br />\0.0001*<br />Prob [ |t| 0.1168<br />\0.0001* 0.0045*<br />Prob [ |t| \0.0001*<br />0.0002* 0.1239 0.0180*<br /><br />123<br /><br />158<br />temperatures. These harsh winter conditions, therefore, allowed for greater differentiation between coldtolerant and intolerant plants for future breeding projects and/or new mapping populations, and provide a better understanding of the relationship between over-wintering and rhizome growth.<br />All of our over-wintering statistical models (Table 2) were signiﬁcant at the a = 0.01 level but had varying degrees of predictive power in R2 coefﬁcients. The logistical model was the most useful, indicating that 33 % of the variation in over-wintering can be explained by the rhizome parameters measured. Contrary to conventional opinion, 67 % of the variation in overwintering was unaccounted for by rhizomes under the best of the models. This unexplained variation may appear to indicate that rhizome growth is not as important to over-wintering as previously thought. However, there are alternative explanations for the low amount of variation explained by rhizomes in our study. One obvious explanation is that our measurements may not have accounted for all rhizome growth due to the nondestructive measurements that were taken. Rhizome phenotyping was based entirely on aboveground indicators of rhizomes since determining the longevity of plant survival was an important aspect of this study. This means that our method was unable to detect rhizomes that had not produced above-ground shoots. Rhizome depth, for example, has been implicated to play a major role in winter survival because of soil insulation (Warwick et al. 1986). Rhizome depth measurements were not taken during this study because of their invasive nature which would have compromised the plants’ ability to over-winter undisturbed. It should be noted, however, that excavation of plants at the end of the study conﬁrmed the presence of rhizomes, even for the most weakly rhizomatous by above-ground determination. Within our population every surviving plant had rhizomes, indicating that although not the only factor, rhizomes appear necessary for winter survival under our study conditions.<br />In addition to rhizomes, other factors likely condition over-wintering, including anti-freeze proteins (Cansev et al. 2009; Kosova´ et al. 2011), carbohydrate fractions (Whitmire 2011), and cold tolerance of root-ball crown (Livingston and Henson 1998; Livingston et al. 1989). Because all above-ground plant material died during the 2010–2011 winter, and most died during the milder 2011–2012 winter, we conclude that if anti-freeze proteins such as dehydrins or others persisted in our<br />123<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />material, they must be present and/or effective only in the below-ground plant structures. Cold resistance within the crown seems unlikely because most RDS in our study originated from areas other than the crown of the plant. Root-ball cold tolerance as a critical factor in over-wintering cannot be ruled out because the rhizomes and root-ball material that we observed were generally closely associated with each other.<br />QTL analysis<br />An additional objective of this study was to re-examine a region of sorghum SBI-01 that was previously shown to encode for rhizome formation in interspeciﬁc hybrids between S. bicolor and S. propinquum (Paterson et al. 1995). The completed genome sequence of the parental line BTx623 (Paterson et al. 2009; Goodstein et al. 2012) facilitated the rapid identiﬁcation of additional molecular markers for reﬁning trait loci. Of 16 new SSRs assayed, six were informative (polymorphic in population, easily scorable). The markers spanned a region with a total linkage distance of 6.78 cM and a total physical distance of 15.71 Mb (Fig. 1). Utilizing these new markers, two novel QTL for over-wintering were detected within the region (Tables 3, 4). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time over-wintering QTL have been identiﬁed in this area of sorghum SBI-01, and we speculate that this likely relates to the over-wintering selection pressure experienced during the ﬁrst winter. Of great interest to us is the QTL (labeled Over-wintering 2011B) that overlaps directly with a genomic region associated with rhizome growth. At present, we cannot conclude that the same gene or genes in this genomic region are conditioning both over-wintering and rhizome formation, but the colocalization of over-wintering and rhizome formation QTL provide further circumstantial evidence to support the hypothesis that rhizomatousness is an important, perhaps necessary, factor in sorghum’s ability to over-winter.<br />The second region associated with over-wintering on SBI-01 is distinct from the over-wintering QTL discussed above, indicating that two unique genes on SBI-01 are involved in over-wintering. In addition, using the 1-LOD intervals for all QTL, this second region would be considered distinct from any of the rhizome growth-related regions identiﬁed in this study. If in fact the causal gene(s) for this region are distinct from those of the rhizome QTL, it is possible<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />that this region represents the contribution of an additional physiological/morphological factor besides rhizome growth that controls sorghum’s over-wintering ability. However, it must be stated that using the 2-LOD regions for the QTL would indicate that this QTL may represent the same causal gene(s) as one of the other identiﬁed rhizome QTL in the study, RDS 2010. Additional studies using a larger population size and additional environments and markers are likely required to clarify this observation.<br />In addition to over-wintering, signiﬁcant QTL regions were also identiﬁed for RDS distance in 2010, RDS count in 2010, and RDS distance in 2011 (Tables 3 and 4 and Fig. 1). These QTL were a conﬁrmation of the original rhizome QTL found by Paterson et al. (1995), but the locus was reﬁned by further marker analysis. Using the 2-LOD intervals from the 2010 data alone, we have narrowed the original QTL region for the rhizome traits measured from a genomic region spanning *58.7 Mb to a region of *14.5 Mb. This reduction in the physical size of the locus (75 % reduction) also reduced the number of candidate genes within the QTL region<br />Fig. 1 Chromosome 1 QTL map. On the left-hand side is the full map of sorghum chromosome one (linkage group C) including QTL as reported by Paterson et al. (1995). The remainder of the ﬁgure is an enlargement of a section of chromosome 1 between markers pSB062 and pSB0088 (the chosen region of analysis for this study). Calculated map distances in centimorgans along with actual physical distances from the S. bicolor genome are displayed next to the ﬁgure. QTL marked ‘‘Over-wintering 2011A’’ and ‘‘Over-wintering 2011B’’ come from the same data collected in March 2011<br /><br />159<br />from approximately 2,970–1,407, a 53 % reduction in candidate genes (Paterson et al. 2009; Goodstein et al. 2012). While these results are clearly not adequate to allow identiﬁcation of candidate genes, the results do indicate that narrowing the locus is readily achievable, given additional markers and larger population sizes. With the advent of whole genome marker analysis utilizing next generation sequencing, the ability to ﬁne map this and other over-wintering loci will not be restricted by the ability to saturate the genome with informative markers. Rather, the ability to accurately phenotype rhizome growth and over-wintering has become the limiting factor in determining genome regions conditioning these important traits.<br />Our ability to accurately phenotype rhizomes in large populations may make it possible to map QTL for RDS growth. Both our results and those reported by Paterson et al. (1995) show 1-LOD intervals for RDS growth to be smaller than those for RDS distance. Assuming that both of these phenotypes are controlled by the same gene(s), we could conclude that RDS distance is a more variable, and thus less accurate, means of measuring rhizome growth than is RDS<br /><br />123<br /><br />160 Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br /><br />Table 3 Signiﬁcant QTL regions for S. bicolor 9 S. propinquum F4 hybrids: their LOD scores, phenotypic variation explained, additive effect, and dominance effect<br /><br />Trait name<br /><br />Position(cM)<br /><br />Left marker from peak<br /><br />Right marker from peak<br /><br />LOD<br /><br />PVE (%)<br /><br />Additive effect<br /><br />Dominance effect<br /><br />Ln2010Dist Ln2010RDS Ln2011Dist Over-wintering2011B Over-wintering2011A<br /><br />4 4.5 3.5 4.1 6.1<br /><br />SBL1B5H SB050A SBL1B5H SBL1B5H SBL1B6G<br /><br />SB050A SBL1B6C SB050A SB050A pSB0088<br /><br />2.81 10.72 2.99 14.18 2.63 38.25 3.91 11.53 7.09 25.32<br /><br />-0.09 -0.73 -0.57<br />0.00 -0.03<br /><br />0.49 0.09 0.57 0.45 0.64<br /><br />Table 4 Signiﬁcant markers from single marker analysis for S. bicolor 9 S. propinquum F4 hybrids: their LOD scores, phenotypic variation explained, additive effect, and dominance effect<br /><br />Trait name<br /><br />Marker name Position (cM) LOD PVE (%) Additive effect Dominance effect<br /><br />Ln2010Dist Ln2010Dist Ln2010Dist Ln2010RDS Ln2011Dist Over-wintering 2011 Over-wintering 2011 Over-wintering 2011<br /><br />SBL1B5H SB050A pSB0088 SB050A SBL1B5H SBL1B5H SB050A pSB0088<br /><br />2.96 4.30 6.84 4.30 2.96 2.96 4.30 6.84<br /><br />2.43 9.05 4.80 17.07 2.41 8.98 2.19 7.75 2.38 28.96 5.95 19.14 5.67 18.33 6.87 21.74<br /><br />-0.21 -0.30<br />0.11 -0.70 -0.62 -0.05 -0.16 -0.02<br /><br />0.24 0.42 0.61 –0.31 0.35 0.45 0.40 0.58<br /><br />count. However, using the 2-LOD regions (in our data only), the opposite trend occurs, with RDS being much larger than RDS distance. Separating the data by year, the 2011 QTL are also appreciably larger than the same QTL from the 2010 data. There are several differences between the phenotyped populations for the 2 years that may explain this discrepancy. One explanation is that all 130 plots, some with rhizomes and some without, were included in the analysis for 2010 while only those that survived the following winter were included for 2011. This means that every plant in the 2011 data had at least some rhizome growth. Also, the 2011 data was collected for only 33 plots. Because the 2010 data included lines that did not survive the winter and lines that had little or no rhizome growth, it may have more power for predicting the regions associated with the presence or absence of rhizome growth. The larger population size of the 2010 data would necessarily give it more statistical power than the data from 2011, which would allow it to identify a smaller interval with more conﬁdence.<br />To examine rhizome development under controlled environmental conditions, the interspeciﬁc sorghum<br /><br />population was planted and grown in greenhouse conditions. It became apparent that the extent of rhizome formation is repressed under these artiﬁcial growth conditions. From the greenhouse study, we also discovered that although only limited rhizome development occurred within 10-cm2 pots (which is very little space for 4–6 sorghum plants), some development did occur. In fact many of the plants had small rhizome buds which, although difﬁcult to phenotype for size because they were all so similar, were easily distinguished from root growth for counting. Because of the limited rhizome growth, perhaps due to the small pot size, the greenhouse study precluded the detection of signiﬁcance for rhizome growth on SIB-01. The limited rhizome growth was, however, associated with small broad peaks that overlapped and extended beyond the corresponding regions of the signiﬁcant QTL from the ﬁeld environments. In future studies, we anticipate examining parameters (e.g., larger pots, the use of ﬁeld soil for growth, use of climate-control chambers) that would permit greater rhizome development and hence more accurate phenotyping of QTL conditioning rhizome formation. In addition, optimizing greenhouse<br /><br />123<br /><br />Mol Breeding (2013) 31:153–162<br />conditions for rhizome formation would prove useful for future studies of the transcriptome of rhizomes at the critical developmental stage of rhizome bud formation.<br />Several additional developments in this study were apparent, including that segregation distortion occurred at all loci examined. This distortion was towards the non-rhizomatous parental allele. One possible explanation for this is that the adapted nature of the non-rhizomatous parent created secondary selection. Considering the proximity of the grain shattering allele (Lin et al. 2012) to our region of interest (Fig. 1), this is a very likely explanation. Linkage disequilibrium within this chromosome and our area of interest has been previously reported (Chittenden et al. 1994). As rhizome formation and non-shattering are linked in repulsion, this linkage must be overcome for successful integration of this QTL into grain sorghum cultivars. Another observation that is critical to introgressing this trait into elite sorghum cultivars is the amount of dominance effect from our QTL. The two over-wintering QTL in particular showed very small additive effects and strong dominance effects (Tables 3, 4). This suggests that these QTL have a heterozygous advantage. Because we used F4 individuals rather than the earlier generations used in previous studies (Paterson et al. 1995), we should have had less power for estimating dominance effects, but more for additive effects, making our discovery of dominance effects in this population even more meaningful. These results indicate that although an inbred rhizomatous over-wintering sorghum plant may be possible, using these inbreds in hybrid breeding schemes may produce an even more robust perennial plant.<br />Conclusion<br />Two new QTL for over-wintering were identiﬁed. The targeted rhizome QTL interval was reduced by 75 %, from an area of approximately 58.7 Mb to an area of 14.5 Mb (calculating from the 2-LOD threshold of the 2010 data only). The number of candidate genes within the QTL region was similarly reduced by 53 %, from approximately 2,970–1,407. Furthermore, our phenotypic models showed that in this population rhizomes alone are not responsible for over-wintering, but are necessary. While more research is needed to identify the gene(s) and causal mechanisms responsible for over-wintering in sorghum, this study indicates that rhizomes are vital to<br /><br />161<br />over-wintering ability within our sorghum population. We suggest that research in this area continues, using more exact and accurate ways of measuring rhizome growth, larger populations, and higher density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, sequence-based genotyping, and/or transcriptome analysis.<br />The results of this study should aid in the creation of perennial sorghums that can over-winter in climates where they previously could not. These over-wintering sorghum types could be used for improvements in grain, forage, and biofuel sorghum production. They may prove particularly important because of their abilities to limit soil erosion, increase water use efﬁciency, and decrease fertilizer input needs. The results of this study may also be applicable to other crop species, both closely and distantly related.<br />Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge Keith Schertz and Andrew Paterson for creating these original populations and Dr. Paterson for help in selection of families.<br />Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: Bhatti, A.G., Endrizzi, J.E., Reeves, R.G., Origin of Johnson grass (1960) J Hered, 51, pp. 107-110; <br/>Cansev, A., Gulen, H., Eris, A., Cold-hardiness of olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars in cold-acclimated and non-acclimated stages: seasonal alteration of antioxidative enzymes and dehydrin-like proteins (2009) J Agric Sci, 147, pp. 51-61. , doi:10.1017/S0021859608008058;<br/>Chittenden, L.M., Schertz, K.F., Lin, Y.R., Wing, R.A., Paterson, A.H., A detailed RFLP map of Sorghum bicolor x S. propinquum, suitable for high-density mapping, suggests ancestral duplication of Sorghum chromosomes or chromosomal segments (1994) Theor Appl Genet, 87, pp. 925-933;<br/>Cox, T.S., Bender, M., Picone, C., van Tassel, D.L., Holland, J.B., Brummer, E.C., Zoeller, B.E., Jackson, W., Breeding perennial grain crops (2002) Crit Rev Plant Sci, 21, pp. 59-91;<br/>de Wet, J.M.J., Systematics and evolution of Sorghum sect. sorghum (Gramineae) (1978) Am J Bot, 65, pp. 477-484;<br/>Dowling III, C.D., (2011) Marker-assisted verification of hybrids in pearl millet-napiergrass [Pennisetum glaucum (L.)

Like rice, the most recent genome duplication in sorghum appears to be ~70 million years ago (Paterson et al. 2004), simplifying its comparative and functional genomics. With a high-quality DNA sequence (Paterson et al. 2009), the ~740 megabase pair sorghum genome is of high value for better understanding the genome of maize (Schnable et al. 2009) and in particular the impact of an ancient tetraploidy in maize shortly after its lineage diverged from that of sorghum (Swigonova et al. 2004). Sorghum is of particular importance as a diploid model for the Saccharinae clade of grasses that includes recently formed complex polyploids such as Saccharum (sugarcane, currently the world’s no. 1 biofuel crop), and Miscanthus, among the greatest-yielding of biomass crops in the U.S. Midwest (Heaton et al. 2008). Each of these polyploids share substantial genetic colinearity and synteny with sorghum (Kim et al. 2012; Ming et al. 1998), and Saccharum quantitative trait loci (QTL) often show positional correspondence<br /><br />Volume 3 | January 2013 | 101<br /><br />Figure 1 Genetic map of the S. bicolor · S. propinquum RILs.

One of the few crops suited to all proposed approaches for renewable fuel production. i.e., from starch, sugar, and/or cellulose, sorghum itself is presently the no. 2 U.S. source of fuel ethanol from grain (after maize, and is a promising cellulosic biofuel crop (Rooney et al. 2007).<br />Sorghum bicolor · Sorghum propinquum is thought to be the widest euploid cross that can be made with the cultigen (S. bicolor) by conventional means, and interspeciﬁc populations from these species offer opportunities to genetically dissect a wide range of traits related to plant domestication and crop productivity, some of which have begun to receive attention (Chittenden et al. 1994; Feltus et al. 2006; Hu et al. 2003; Lin et al. 1995, 1999; Paterson et al. 1995a,b). The opportunities offered by comparison of S. bicolor and S. propinquum have led to much effort to develop genomics resources, including a detailed genetic map (Bowers et al. 2003; Chittenden et al. 1994), bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome-based physical maps for both species (Bowers et al. 2005; Draye et al. 2001; Lin et al. 1999), expressed sequence tag (EST) resources (Pratt et al. 2005), and a genome sequence (Paterson et al. 2009).<br />Among many other aspects of growth and development, S. bicolor and S. propinquum differ in characteristics related to perenniality, a life history strategy for which the Sorghum genus has become a model (Hu et al. 2003; Jang et al. 2009; Paterson et al. 1995b). Both consideration of how to expand agriculture to provide plant biomass for production of fuels or chemical feedstocks (Tilman et al. 2009), and strategies to rebalance food production with preservation of ecological capital (Glover et al. 2010), focus heavily on perenniality. Perenniality may also be a curse—Sorghum halepense, a wild perennial polyploid resulting from natural hybridization between S. bicolor and S. propinquum, ﬁnds occasional use as forage and even food (seed/ﬂour) but is most noted as one of the world’s most noxious weeds, having spread from its west Asian center of diversity across much of Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Demonstration that most genes responsible for variations in size and number in Sorghum and Oryza of an important perennation organ, the rhizome, map to<br /><br />corresponding chromosomal locations (Hu et al. 2003), suggests that information about rhizomatousness from a few models (that are also major crops) may extrapolate broadly to a wide range of taxa.<br />By single-seed descent from the same S. bicolor · S. propinquum F2 population used in early-generation genetic analysis (Lin et al. 1995), we have produced and describe here a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 161 F5 genotypes that segregate for a wide range of traits, providing a valuable addition to the genetic resources available for this botanical and genomic model. The genetic control of ﬂowering provides an example of how the RIL population contributes to improved knowledge of trait inheritance.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Genotyping and data analysis The mapping population comprised 161 F5 RILs derived by selﬁng of single F2 plants described previously (Lin et al. 1995) from a controlled cross between single plants of S. bicolor BTx623, and S. propinquum (unnamed accession). Leaf samples were frozen at 280° and lyophilized for 48 hr. Genomic DNA was extracted from the lyophilized leaf sample based on Aljanabi et al. 1999. Polymerase chain reactions for simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis were carried out under standard conditions for all primer pairs using 1 U of Taq polymerase with 10· polymerase chain reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 9, 500 mM KCl, and 15 mM MgCl2), 2 mM dNTP, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 20 ng of DNA template with a ﬁnal reaction volume of 10 mL. The thermo-cycling was performed with the following program: (1) Preheat at 95° for 3 min, (2) denaturation at 95° for 30 sec, (3) annealing at 65° for 1 min (21°/ cycle), (4) extension at 72° for 1 min, (5) 10 cycles of steps (2)~(4), (6) denaturation at 95° for 30 sec, (7) annealing at 55° for 1 min, (8) extension at 72° for 1 min, (9) 32 cycles of steps (6)~(7), and (10) ﬁnal extension at 72° for 5 min.

MAPMAKER (Lander et al. 1987) was used for map construction with the data type ‘ri self,’ which is suitable for the RIL conﬁguration. Heterozygosity in codominant markers was treated as missing data by MAPMAKER because the ‘ri self’ conﬁguration does not recognize it. Map distances, cM, were calculated using the Kosambi function (Kosambi 1944). Marker loci were grouped by two-point linkage analysis with a logarithm of odds ratio (LOD) threshold of 4.0 and a maximum distance of 30 cM. Local maximum likelihood orders of marker loci were conﬁrmed using the ‘ripple’ command. The map was drawn using Adobe Illustrator. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, single 1.5-m plots of each RIL were transplanted (2009, 2011) or direct seeded at the University of Georgia Plant Science Farm, Watkinsville, GA, in a completely randomized design. Flowering dates were recorded for the ﬁrst ﬁve ﬂowers per plot. The average of the ﬁrst ﬁve ﬂowering days was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The means<br /><br />of the ﬂowering dates over years were estimated using best linear<br /><br />unbiased prediction with SAS PROC MIXED.

Of those 203 markers, 135 segregating for 141 marker loci were mapped into 10 linkage groups corresponding to the 10 sorghum chromosomes. The remaining markers were excluded due to redundancy (i.e., cosegregation of multiple bands from the same primer) and weak and/or apparent artifactual ampliﬁcations. Among the 141 loci mapped in the F5 RILs, there is an average of 9 (5.6%) missing genotypes per locus, with 95% of the loci having less than 29 (18%)<br /><br />missing genotypes. Among 95 loci mapped in the F2 population, there is an average of 25 (6.8%) missing genotypes per locus, with 95% of the loci having less than 103 (27.8%) missing genotypes.<br />The genetic map of the RILs derived from annual S. bicolor and perennial S. propinquum (Figure 1) contains 141 loci on 10 linkage groups collectively spanning 773.1 cM.

To assign linkage groups to chromosomes, we anchored framework markers to physical locations by blasting against the sorghum genome sequence. We then assigned and placed additional markers to the framework at LOD score of $3.0 and carefully checked for double recombination events in the original scoring data.<br />Comparison of genetic map to physical positions<br />Comparison of the genetic map to physical positions of the mapped loci reveals the relationship between genetic distances and physical distances and the physical distribution of markers along the genome. Each marker on the genetic map was aligned to its corresponding physical position by virtue of the published S. bicolor genome sequence [Figure 1 (Paterson et al. 2009)]. The sorghum genome sequence information was given priority in ordering markers that were indistinguishable genetically. Overall, a total of 110 of 141 markers in 10 linkage groups are well aligned to their physical positions. The marker order in the genetic map occasionally deviates from that in the physical map. Distal markers on a linkage group tend to disagree more with the physical map than markers in the middle of a group, presumably due to a lack of ﬂanking markers at the ends of chromosomes. A small number of markers show best matches to sequences that are on different chromosomes from where they map genetically. Factors that may contribute to the discrepancies between the genetic and physical maps include multiple ampliﬁcations of paralogous loci; sequence assembly errors; or cryptic structural differences between S. bicolor and S. propinquum.<br />The mapped SSR marker loci provide substantial coverage of the genetic map, with the exception of chromosome 6 for which markers only cover the lower one third of the chromosome (Figure 1). The unmapped region of this chromosome includes a large heterochromatic block (about 34 Mb) that contains the S. propinquum Ma1 allele conferring short-day ﬂowering (Lin et al. 1995). There is ample polymorphism between the parental genotypes in this region and we mapped the region in the F2 population (Lin et al. 1995). However, the RIL population was advanced in a temperate latitude, and artiﬁcial selection has largely eliminated photoperiodic ﬂowering. This selection, together with limited recombination in this heterochromatic region, account for it being underpopulated with DNA markers in the RIL map.<br />Marker distribution is not even along the physical map: markers are concentrated in distal regions and sparse in central regions of the chromosomes. In an extreme case, chromosome 8, a recombinational distance of 4.7 cM spans a physical distance of approximately 46.3 Mb, covering a remarkable 83.4% of the chromosome. This phenomenon is in accordance with our previous observations (Bowers et al. 2005; Lin et al. 1995; Paterson et al. 2009) that the sorghum pericentromeric heterochromatin is recalcitrant to recombination, with the vast majority of recombination occurring in the distal euchromatin.<br />Segregation distortion<br />In the F5 RILs, all chromosomes except chromosome 7 contain regions with segregation distortion signiﬁcant at the 5% level (Table 1). A total of 14 apices (peak genomic regions) of distortion were found, on chromosome 1 near cM 35.8, chromosome 2 near cM 50.6, chromosome 3 near cM 11.2, 35.0, 66.1, and 84.3; chromosome 4 near cM 77.2, chromosome 5 near cM 0.0 and 60.3; chromosome 6 near cM 0.0; chromosome 8 near cM 39.5; chromosome 9 near cM<br /><br />26.5 and 37.7; and chromosome 10 near cM 88.7. All regions showed enrichment for S. bicolor alleles. Other than the chromosome 6 region under selection for day-neutral ﬂowering, the most striking case of segregation distortion was on chromosome 1—the apex of this distortion was near the locus Xcup24 with a segregation ratio of 154:3 (homozygous S. bicolor: S. propinquum). This apex was genetically less than 1 cM from the most extreme case found in the F2 population from which these RILs are derived: the locus CSU507 on LG C (Bowers et al. 2003). In a larger set of F2 progeny previously described (Lin et al. 1995), we found similarly distorted segregation (203:15) in this region.<br />We compared the 14 regions of segregation distortion in the F5 RILs to the levels and patterns of segregation found in the F2 population from which these RILs are derived. Because different DNA markers were used in the two studies, this was done by aligning the F2 and F5 genetic maps to their physical locations on the S. bicolor genome (Paterson et al. 2009). A total of 11 regions of segregation distortion were found in the F2 (Table 1). Four of the 11 regions of segregation distortion in the F2 population favored the S. propinquum alleles, among which three are no longer distorted in the F5 RILs, and one region near the end of chromosome 2 contains overrepresentation of S. bicolor alleles (!) in the F5 RILs. Those regions with overrepresentation of S. bicolor alleles in the F2 generally also contain such overabundance in the F5 RILs, albeit a few cases lack nearby DNA markers. However, eight regions showing normal segregation in the F2 showed overabundance of the S. bicolor allele in the F5 RILs.<br />Residual heterozygosity We compared regions of excess/deﬁciency of residual heterozygosity in the F5 RILs and the F2 population (Table 2). In the F2, eight regions show excess and two show deﬁciency of heterozygotes. All except two of these also show segregation distortion. In the F5, much higher homozygosity makes it difﬁcult to distinguish heterozygote deﬁciency with statistical signiﬁcance but 29 regions show excess, 7 (24%) of which also show segregation distortion. In the F2, the regions showing excess are all small (diagnosed by only 1 marker each); however, a large region of chromosome 1 shows deﬁciency of heterozygotes. In the F5, there are 3 large regions showing heterozygote excess in chromosomes 4, 5, and 7, respectively.<br />Initial QTL mapping<br />To explore the merit of the RIL population for QTL mapping, we focused on ﬂowering, a trait associated with the tropical origin of S. propinquum that had a large confounding effect on many traits in F2 QTL mapping. In the RIL population, near-homozygosity for the S. bicolor allele along the salient portion of chromosome 6 reveals that we have largely eliminated genotypes with short-day ﬂowering alleles from S. propinquum. A total of three ﬂowering QTL met a LOD threshold of 2.61 based on 1000 permutation tests on chromosomes 4, 8, and 9 (Figure 2, Table 3). The chromosome 9 QTL found here closely overlaps one found in the F2 generation (Lin et al. 1995), which also overlaps a QTL found in several other sorghum populations (Feltus et al. 2006; Mace and Jordan 2011). The chromosome 8 QTL also closely corresponds to one found in the BTx623 · IS3620c cross (Brown et al. 2006), and the S. propinquum allele confers early ﬂowering, accounting for the transgressants we observed in F2 and F5. The chromosome 4 QTL is newly discovered in this population, perhaps “unmasked” as a result of removing short-day ﬂowering but is in a region in which ﬂowering QTL have been reported previously (Mace and Jordan 2011). Indeed, it shows a “double peak” that may indicate the actions of two nearby genes although we presently infer only a single likelihood interval with statistical conﬁdence. Although<br /><br />106 | W. Kong et al.<br /><br />a previously reported QTL on chromosome 2 (Lin et al. 1995) did not reach statistical signiﬁcance here, there was subthreshold evidence of it (LOD ~1) in the vicinity that it was previously mapped to.<br />DISCUSSION The S. bicolor · S. propinquum RIL population offers advantages over early-generation populations that promises to shed new light on the genetic, environmental, and physiological/biochemical factors that regulate plant growth and development. Dramatic variation in plant architecture, growth and development, reproduction, and life histories of the parental species that segregate among the progeny, together with homozygosity of the RILs and the ability to replicate them across a spectrum of natural and/or controlled conditions, makes this population of high potential importance for the discovery and validation of QTL. Many of these traits have been measured and will be reported under separate cover.<br />Advancement of the RIL population in a temperate environment (Lubbock, TX) may improve the ability to resolve QTL for traits that were previously below the signiﬁcance threshold, also providing a more realistic assessment of variation that is relevant to temperate latitudes. For example, near-homozygosity for the S. bicolor allele along the salient portion of chromosome 6 reveals that we have largely eliminated genotypes with photoperiod sensitivity (“short-day ﬂowering”), a trait associated with the tropical origin of S. propinquum that had a large confounding effect on many traits in F2-based QTL mapping. Eliminating the profound morphophysiological alteration associated with short-day ﬂowering permitted us to identify two ﬂowering QTL that eluded detection in our previous study with 370 F2 plants (Lin et al. 1995), one of which accounted for the observation that a few segregants ﬂowered earlier than the early-ﬂowering parent.<br />The advancement of the RIL population in an environment to which the S. bicolor parent was well adapted (indeed bred for) but the S. propinquum parent was not may have had some undesirable consequences as well. All segregation distortions in the F5 generation involved excesses of S. bicolor alleles, whereas the F2 generation showed similar numbers of cases of S. bicolor and S. propinquum excess. This ﬁnding suggests that in addition to the intended removal of short-day ﬂowering, advancement of the population in temperate continental conditions may have caused some inadvertent selection against other traits of S. propinquum, a native of southeast Asia that inhabits streamsides and moist places [(Anonymous 2006) zipcodezoo.com/Plants/S/Sorghum_propinquum/#footref_2]. Although these biases favoring S. bicolor alleles may impact the ability to map QTL in a few regions of the genome, the population still exhibits a wide range of morphophysiological variations, with individual lines more comparable to one another by virtue of the near-absence of Ma1.<br />Beneﬁting from several additional cycles of recombination beyond our previous F2 population, comparison of this genetic map to the sorghum physical map and sequence highlight the striking bias in distribution of recombination across the sorghum genome. This is a good news2bad news scenario—relatively small amounts of physical DNA per cM may facilitate genomic analyses in the gene-rich portions of the genome, but large blocks of recombination-recalcitrant heterochromatin hinder access to other important genes.<br />Additional recombination that has accrued in the development of this RIL population may have also improved our ability to resolve apices (peak genomic regions) of heterozygote excess, accounting for their greater abundance in F5 than F2 generations, and occurrence in multiple locations on all chromosomes except the one (chromosome 6) for which about two-thirds of the physical length has been ﬁxed due to selection against the S. propinquum short-day ﬂowering allele.<br /><br />A remarkably high 29 apices of heterozygote excess, together with rich genetic and genomic tools for these species, may make this an attractive system in which to further dissect the biology underlying interspeciﬁc heterozygote advantage.<br />ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank members of the Paterson lab and two anonymous reviewers for many valuable contributions, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service, USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, and U.S. Department of Energy–USDA Plant Feedstock Genomics Program for ﬁnancial support.

Introduction<br /><br />Annual cereal crops, oilseeds, and legumes provide 80% of global food (Cox et al., 2010 and Lobell et al., 2011) and comprise 60–80% of global cropland (Cox et al., 2006 and Glover et al., 2007). These crops are often grown in industrialized monocultures, which demand high labor, energy, pesticide, and fertilizer inputs (Cox et al., 2006). If the global population continues to grow at its current rate, by 2050, one billion more ha of land will need to be converted to agriculture to produce enough food to meet global demands (Naylor et al., 2007). This increase in cultivated cropland will have substantial negative impacts on species biodiversity, ecosystem functions, water quality and carbon emissions.<br /><br />There has been considerable effort towards developing agricultural solutions that will minimize environmental impacts while dealing with the more than 60% of the world population that is malnourished (Jackson, 1980, WHO, 2000, Glover et al., 2007 and FAO, 2009). For example, corn can be cultivated with minimal soil erosion and water runoff using alternative practices (e.g., Kidd and Pimentel, 1992), although most annual cropping systems continue to have substantial negative impacts on water, soil, air, and wildlife (Foley et al., 2005). Although annual crops have many detrimental impacts on the environment, research will continue to improve traditional annual agriculture to increase grain yields and decrease environmental costs (Pimentel et al., 2005). This paper addresses the potential environmental benefits and challenges of developing and cultivating perennial grains to reduce soil erosion and improve productivity while reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture.<br />2. Environmental impacts of annual crop production<br />2.1. Soil erosion<br /><br />Soil erosion is exacerbated by annual grain agricultural practices, particularly on exposed soil and steeply sloped land (Chiras et al., 2002). Estimates of the rate of erosion are 15.2 Mt/ha/year globally (about 197–303 billion Mt annually) (Lal, 2003b), while the rate of soil formation is about one Mt/ha/year, making soil a non-renewable resource (Lal, 1998). An estimated one third (0.5 billion ha) of global cropland was lost to soil erosion over the last 50 years (Pimentel et al., 1995).<br /><br />Soil erosion negatively affects crop yield by removal of topsoil, mixing topsoil and lower soil layers, reduced effective rooting depth, decreased soil water-holding capacity, loss of nutrients in soil, damage to seedlings, loss of arable area, reduced soil organic matter (SOM), and changes in soil structure (Lal, 1998 and den Biggelaar et al., 2001). These accumulated effects result in reduced crop yields, and are not fully ameliorated by increased fertilizer and chemical inputs (Pimentel et al., 1995, Lal, 1998 and den Biggelaar et al., 2001). Estimates of the magnitude of this reduction in crop yield are highly variable, although the general consensus is a 4% reduction in yield per 0.1 m of soil loss (Bakker et al., 2007). Because of this apparent reduction in yield, the increased inputs to compensate for nutrient losses due to erosion can be substantial (Bockus and Shroyer, 1998). Due to this reduced crop productivity, soil degradation due to erosion is also taking many agricultural lands out of production (Lal, 1998). Soil erosion has many other negative effects beyond that of reducing crop yield. Erosion can reduce the storage-water capacity of soils by decreasing soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content (den Biggelaar et al., 2001). Erosion to deeper soil layers poses a problem because roots cannot viably extend into these layers, and so the ability of plants to grow and to produce a crop will be diminished. Moreover, the sediments produced by erosion and transported by wind or water runoff can have detrimental effects to water ecosystems, degrading water quality and water cycling (Uri, 2000). In total, the annual costs of erosion in the U.S. and globally are substantial (Pimentel et al., 1995 and Chiras et al., 2002).<br />2.2. Tillage problems<br /><br />One of the leading causes of soil erosion is the practice of tilling the soil, widely used for the cultivation of annual crops. In a comparative study of tillage types for a corn–soybean rotation for different regions of Iowa, conventional tillage resulted in soil erosion rates 4–10 times higher than no-till practices (Zhao et al., 2006a and Zhao et al., 2006b). Tillage does have other consequences, including increased farm labor costs, energy usage and technological inputs. For example, corn grown in developing countries requires 1144 human hours of labor-intensive hand-tillage per ha every year (Lewis, 1951). In addition, tillage can result in loss of nutrients; about 50 kg of nitrogen, 2 kg of phosphorus, 400 kg of potassium, per ha are lost due to soil erosion from tillage (Pimentel et al., 1995). Tillage also alters soil structure and functioning, reduces microbial biomass and food web complexity (Dupont et al., 2010), increases soil temperatures, and lowers the water content of soil. Thus, conventional tillage practices reduce soil productivity over time (Dupont et al., 2010).<br />2.3. Water problems<br /><br />The global demand for fresh water is increasing as the human population continues to grow; water withdrawals have nearly tripled and irrigated land area has doubled since 1950 (UN, 2009). Most water withdrawals are from surface water, yet these sources, such as lakes, rivers and streams comprise only 1/10,000 of 1% of the earth's freshwater resources (USGS, 2010). The world currently uses an estimated 4000 cubic kilometers (km3) of freshwater each year (UN, 2009), of which about half of global water withdrawal is for irrigation (UN, 2003), including 40% of US water withdrawn for irrigation (Pimentel et al., 2004). Ground water sources constitute a substantial portion of water withdrawal; 21% of water withdrawn in the US comes from ground aquifers including water for irrigation (USBC, 2004). This is a concern because aquifers are replenished at rates ranging from 0.1% to 3% per year (Pimentel et al., 2004), and the rate of withdrawal is depleting aquifers. Water scarcity is especially poignant for agriculture although only 18% of world cropland is irrigated, this irrigated area accounts for 40% of global food (FAOSTAT, 2011). The Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that by 2030, 20% of developing countries will experience impending water scarcity (FAO, 2002), which will be exacerbated by increased irrigation.<br />2.4. Water pollution<br /><br />In the United States, agriculture is listed as a source of pollution for 48% of the rivers that are considered “impaired” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (EPA, 2003 and Broussard and Turner, 2009). Pollution comes from agricultural inputs of chemical fertilizers, eroded soils and pesticides. The EPA calculates that in 2006 152 kg/ha/yr of fertilizer were used in the U.S. (NASS, 2005). Nitrogen is most often the limiting nutrient in soil for crop production and so is heavily supplemented through chemical sources (Randall and Mulla, 2001). However, studies analyzing global data for maize, rice, and wheat indicate that these grains take up only 20–50% of the nitrogen applied in fertilizer and large amounts of nitrogen are lost through runoff (Cassman et al., 2002). Increased nitrogen in the soil, water and atmosphere results in loss of biodiversity, decline of fisheries, pollution of groundwater and surface water (i.e., aquifers, lakes, streams, and rivers), pollution of drinking water, algae blooms and dead zones in estuaries and enclosed marine areas (EPA, 2005) such as Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi Delta (Osterman et al., 2009).<br />2.5. Energy usage<br /><br />Energy costs affect all aspects of annual grain production, including direct costs of gasoline and diesel and indirect costs of inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers (Pimentel and Pimentel, 2008). Large quantities of energy are required to till the soil; about 835 l of oil equivalents per ha are required to till the soil to produce a crop such as corn (Pimentel and Patzek, 2008). A total of 75 l of oil equivalents of fertilizer and chemical inputs are required to replace nutrients lost to soil erosion (Pimentel et al., 1995). These direct and indirect energy costs so permeate modern annual grain agriculture that half of the per ha operating costs of producing corn in the United States are from fertilizer and fuel costs. While predictions of the trajectory of energy costs vary widely, even a small increase in energy costs will result in considerable increases in production costs. One estimate suggests that the entire global food system requires about 10 kcal of fossil energy to provide 1 kcal of food (Pimentel and Pimentel, 2008).<br />2.6. Climate change<br /><br />Soil erosion is also a major contributor to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and global climate change (Lal et al., 2007). The global soil carbon pool is the third largest global carbon pool (2500 Gt) (Lal, 2004) and represents a balance between carbon inputs from decomposition of organic matter and release of carbon into the atmosphere (Post and Kwon, 2000 and Lal, 2003a). The depletion of the soil carbon pool and subsequent release of CO2 into the atmosphere via the oxidation and mineralization of soil organic matter is increased by tillage and soil erosion (de Jong and Kachnoski, 1988 and Lal, 2003a). The 2010 U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report by the EPA calculated that the agricultural sector emitted 427.5 Mt of CO2 in 2008, or 6% of total US greenhouse gas emissions (EPA, 2011).<br />3. Improving the environmental performance of annual crops<br /><br />To achieve ecosystem sustainability, farmers must employ conservation tillage alternatives to traditional tillage practices, while minimizing negative environmental effects. Two of these alternatives are reduced tillage or no-tillage practices (Hobbs, 2007). Conservation tillage can improve the physical quality of soil, reduce soil erosion, retain soil moisture, and reduce costs compared with traditional tillage practices. These benefits can result in the reduction of 30–50% of labor and diesel fuel use compared with traditional tillage practices (Chiras et al., 2002). However, conservation tillage can have negative effects, including increased pathogen prevalence that results from providing a year-round host in the soil. No-tillage systems, a stricter method of conservation tillage, reduce soil erosion by not using chisel-disking. However, in no-till systems weeds are not tilled under and herbicides may be necessary to curb weed growth which can lead to toxic chemical runoff (Cox et al., 2010).<br /><br />An approach to improving farming practices is the use of legumes in conservation farming systems. A 22-year experiment conducted in Pennsylvania measured soil, water, and energy conservation in a legume-based corn–soybean system, where winter vetch (a legume) was planted after harvest of corn and soybeans, compared with a conventional corn–soybean system (Penn State farming system) (Pimentel et al., 2005). No commercial nitrogen fertilizer or any pesticides were applied to the legume-based system. However, these chemicals were applied to the conventional system. Fossil energy inputs in the legume-based system were 32% lower than those in the conventional system, although the legume-based system required 35% higher input of labor.<br /><br />Under normal conditions there were no differences in crop yields between the two systems; however, under drought conditions, corn yields in the legume-based system were 34% higher than those in the conventional system while soybean yields were 50% higher in the legume-based system (Pimentel et al., 2005). The legume-based system had considerably higher presence of soil organic matter and soil biota than in the conventional system. The conventional system experienced much higher levels of soil erosion and water run off than the legume-based system. Overall the legume-based system was more productive, more economical, used less energy, and was environmentally sound compared with the conventional system (Pimentel et al., 2005).<br />4. Putative perennial grain benefits<br /><br />While improvements to sustainable agriculture have been developed, many problems persist, including soil erosion, pollution, reliance on chemical inputs and inefficient water use. Perennial grains have been suggested as a potential solution to the problems associated with annual grains. Although perennials are currently used on only a small area of global cropland there are many purported benefits to perennial grains (Glover et al., 2010b). The potential benefits of perennial grains are similar to benefits found in alternative agriculture systems including reduced tillage systems, low input systems and legume-based systems. Currently, natural perennial strains are undergoing genetic modification research and breeding programs to improve selected traits and there is a great potential for perennial grains to be used in commercial agricultural production (Glover et al., 2010b).<br />4.1. Soil conservation and water conservation/runoff<br /><br />Perennial crops have many benefits for soil and water conservation. In conventional annual cropping systems, weak rooting systems and seasonal periods of exposed soil result in high levels of soil erosion and water run off (Cox et al., 2010). Perennial crops will mitigate these problems primarily for two reasons. First, perennial crops have extensive rooting structures, particularly when compared to annual counterparts. Deep rooting systems can facilitate water infiltration (Glover et al., 2010a) and are expected to better utilize water and nutrients (DeHaan et al., 2005). Second, soil organic matter will be increased significantly when perennial rather than annual crops are utilized (Pimentel et al., 2005 and Glover et al., 2010a). Also perennial crops remain in the ground during fallow seasons which can reduce soil erosion, increase the retention of topsoil, decrease tillage, labor, and fuel consumption, improve wildlife habitat, increase efficient water use, decrease chemical leaching and surface water pollution, increase soil microbial activity, and increase carbon sequestration (Jackson, 1980 and Scheinost et al., 2001). With deeper roots than annuals, perennial vegetation and crops have a greater potential to reduce salinization through increased water storage capacity of soil (White et al., 2000, Davies et al., 2005 and Ward et al., 2006). So, replacing annual wheat with perennial wheat could reduce the negative effects of soil salinization (Bell et al., 2010a).<br />4.2. Tillage reduction<br /><br />Some specific perennial crops are assumed to only require re-seeding every three to five years (Bell et al., 2008). Other researchers have sought to develop perennial grain crops that will produce for many decades (Glover et al., 2010a). As a result, the farm labor costs, energy usage, and technological inputs required for yearly tillage will significantly decrease in perennial crop systems. Fewer nutrients are lost due to soil erosion if the crop remains in the ground during fallow seasons and the land is not tilled yearly (Pimentel et al., 1995). In addition, soil microbial complexity increases when tillage is reduced through the use of perennial crops. For example, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a mutualistic relationship with 80% of the known vascular plants which allows them to capture phosphorus and micronutrients from the soil by binding the cortical root cells (Galvez et al., 2001). In experimental studies with annual crops, colonization of AM fungi is higher in no-tillage than in conventional tillage plots, which contributes to plant productivity. Due to this high concentration of AM fungi, low-tillage plots have higher nutrient use efficiency at early developmental stages than conventional plots. These mutualistic relationships could also occur in perennial agriculture (Boerner, 1992), meaning that perennial crops could have higher nutrient use efficiency due to reduced tillage practices.<br />4.3. Soil health<br /><br />Evidence suggests that perennial crop systems, by having year-round vegetation on crop fields, would have more soil fauna diversity and natural belowground processes (Culman et al., 2010). Because the accessibility and processing of soil carbon and nitrogen is largely dictated by soil food webs (Glover et al., 2010b), the presence of perennial vegetation could enrich such soil food webs (Dupont et al., 2009). Soils with extensive fauna and flora exhibit improved soil structure, improved water cycling and reduced compaction, and increases in plant growth (Neher, 1999).<br /><br />Nematodes can be serious pests to crops but some are essential to soil processes and functioning and the species composition can affect processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling (Freckman and Ettema, 1993). In fields with year-round cover, Dupont et al. (2009) found increased presence of opportunist nematodes, which are associated with increases in plant productivity and crop yield. Thus, perennial crop systems could not only increase soil health, but also benefit directly from these increases in soil health.<br />4.4. Fertilizer/nutrient efficiency<br /><br />Perennial crops, with more extensive rooting systems, are less prone to nutrient leaching than annual crops (Randall and Mulla, 2001, Crews, 2004 and Culman et al., 2010). While annual cropping systems result in a nutrient loss and must be supplemented by inputs, perennial systems with legume inter-plants by increasing nitrogen nutrients, could, in some climates, rely solely on endogenous nutrients (Crews, 2004).<br />4.5. Water efficiency<br /><br />Perennial plant root structures reach more deeply into the soil and hold more soil water (Glover et al., 2010b). The presence of perennial grain species may utilize and capture more water in their deep, complex root systems than annual grains, thus reducing water loss through subsurface drainage and surface runoff (Glover et al., 2010b).<br />4.6. Climate change<br /><br />Perennials have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sources through different production practices and from characteristics of the plants themselves. Agricultural carbon emissions can be decreased through reductions in soil erosion which can be achieved through less intensive tillage practices (Lal, 2004). In addition, perennial vegetation, through longer presence in the soil and more extensive rooting systems, increases input of organic matter into the soil, sequestering more carbon (Lal, 2004).<br />4.7. Wildlife habitat<br /><br />A shift toward perennial agriculture could substantially benefit wildlife habitat and could mitigate some of the detrimental impacts of agriculture on wildlife and biodiversity (Fargione et al., 2009). Perennial habitats are considered higher quality for most terrestrial wildlife than cropland associated with annual agriculture (e.g., Riffell et al., 2008). Direct comparisons of wildlife habitat between perennial grasslands used for bio-energy and annual row crops found that avian and mammalian populations largely benefit from shifts to perennial grasslands, although species differences and specific management practices (e.g., whole-field vs. strip harvesting) do affect these relationships (e.g., Murray et al., 2003 and Roth et al., 2005). However, land-use changes drive much of these impacts upon wildlife habitat; while conversions from native wetlands or prairie grasslands to perennial agriculture would likely be disruptive to wildlife habitat, changes from annual cropland to perennial agriculture could improve habitat for a variety of wildlife (e.g., Meehan et al., 2010).<br />5. Perennial grain research and development<br /><br />In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on perennial breeding programs. Perennial grain research is taking place at the Land Institute (perennial sorghum, sunflower, and wheat), Australia's Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research Center (perennial wheat), University of Buenos Aires (Lesquerella oilseed), Swedish University of Agricultural Science (Lepidium oilseed), Washington State University (perennial Thinopyrum wheat), Texas A&amp;M (perennial wheat), University of Manitoba (perennial rye and wheat), and the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Science in China (perennial rice) ( Cox et al., 2010).<br /><br />Because wheat, rice, and maize collectively account for 85% of global grain cultivation, this paper addresses those three crops specifically.<br />5.1. Approaches<br /><br />Perennial grain development thus far has used conventional breeding techniques. Two general approaches have been used: (1) the domestication of wild perennial grass species that have potential as commercial grain crops or (2) the hybridization of current annual grains with related perennial species to combine the perennial habit with the desired domesticated traits of current annuals (Cox et al., 2010). In the former approach, the choice of perennial species largely determines the difficulty and trajectory of the breeding process. In the latter strategy, commonly grown annual crops of rice or wheat or other grains are hand crossed with sexually compatible or desirable perennial relatives. Producing hybrids from genetically distant species is often a large biological barrier to development of perennial grains, and many years of work are spent trying to obtain completely fertile hybrids.<br /><br />The use of genetic engineering in developing perennial grains is inhibited by the fact that genes associated with perennial traits (e.g., re-growth and dormancy) are located on separate chromosomes (DeHaan et al., 2007). However, there is the possibility that genetic engineering will prove useful for trait expression, such as disease and insect resistance, once perennial grains are developed and commercially available (Paoletti and Pimentel, 1996 and Paoletti and Pimentel, 2000).<br />5.1.1. Wheat<br /><br />Many breeders of perennial wheat or relatives are using intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium). In addition to having good seed flavor and high nutritional value, intermediate wheatgrass comes closest to meeting standards of mechanical harvesting which includes a stiff, straight culm, synchronous seed ripening, and relatively good threshability ( Wagoner, 1990). The Land Institute has followed parallel tracks of direct domestication and interspecific hybridization ( Cox et al., 2010). The latter can produce high rates of hybrid sterility and offspring showing weak perenniality. However, these obstacles can be overcome. Other research continues to pursue wheat varieties derived from crossing annual wheat and various Thinopyrum species. Current efforts have produced plants that live for 2–5 years, survive dry summers and cold winters, and produce seeds similar in quality to annual wheat every summer of its lifespan ( KBS, 2010). Yet in general, perennial wheat varieties have not exceeded yields of 60–75% of annual wheat ( Scheinost et al., 2001 and Murphy et al., 2009), and yields decrease substantially after the first harvest. Moreover, most varieties are limited as an end-use product, since insufficient gluten content precludes using currently developed perennial wheat flour for leavened baking.<br />5.1.2. Rice<br /><br />Of the annual staple grains, perennial rice is thought to be the easiest to develop and be adopted by farmers because common cultivars of annual rice (Oryza sativa) are already often weakly perennial, for instance, they are able to produce a ratoon crop ( Sacks et al., 2003a). Despite its promise, perennial rice research only appears to be progressing at the Yunnan Academy for Agricultural Sciences in China. Sloping uplands in China where there is slash and burn agriculture and high erosion rates are prime regions that will directly benefit from perennial rice. The yearlong presence of the large root system can stabilize the eroding land and make it suitable for indefinite food production, thereby preventing farmers from abandoning land and slashing/burning more area for new fields. It is estimated that 14 million ha worldwide are used to grow upland rice, which is 11% of the world's rice area ( CGIAR Science Council, 2006). Poor, rural farmers in Asia concentrated in these upland, rain-fed areas particularly suffer because water scarcity and drought are major factors limiting upland rice yields. A major reason for the disparity between perennial rice and perennial wheat research progress may be that fewer resources are going toward perennial rice research because rice is almost entirely grown in the poorer, less-developed countries; it is estimated that developing nations (mainly in Asia) grow 95% of the world's rice ( Santos et al., 2003). This political barrier, in combination with the sterility of wide-crossed hybrids can delay efficient introgression of desired genes from O. longistaminata (the favored perennial relative) into annual rice ( Sacks et al., 2006).<br /><br />Only inter-specific hybridization has been used to develop a perennial version of annual rice, specifically with annual rice's perennial relatives O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata ( Sacks et al., 2003a and Sacks et al., 2003b). Oryza longistaminata is the most logical donor of perenniality because of its strong rhizome features and relatively high pollen fertility, compared to other wild rice species ( Tao and Sripichitt, 2000). However, hybrid sterility is currently a considerable barrier to rapid development of O. longistaminata crosses ( Sacks et al., 2003b). Oryza rufipogon, the closest perennial ancestor of cultivated rice, has proven to be most effective contributor of genes for making high-yielding, stress-tolerant rice for ratoon cropping ( Sacks et al., 2003a and Tao and Sripichitt, 2000). The progeny of crosses with O. rufipogon have shown good fertility and some of the families that are highest yielding are also the most perennial, which is very encouraging ( Sacks et al., 2003a). The crossing of O. sativa and O. longistaminata produced a significant percentage of plants that were rhizomatous and survived multiple years, but few hybrids produced yields comparable to annual varieties ( Sacks et al., 2003b). However, at least one of Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Science's perennial rice plants from these crosses has lived for ten years, albeit with a modest yield. More important, large populations derived by self-pollinating or backcrossing the initial hybrid have segregated for rhizome expression; some of the rhizomatous plants continue to produce repeated harvests of grain for more than three years.<br />5.1.3. Maize<br /><br />Perennial maize development would probably require making crosses using germplasm from one its two perennial teosinte relatives, Zea diploperennis or Zea perennis. Zea perennis, despite its tetraploid chromosomal count, has proven to have promise as a parent to cross with maize ( Tang et al., 2005). Zea diploperennis has been successfully crossed with maize, and while some progeny did have strongly condensed rhizome-like structures and were fertile, they did not have fully developed rhizomes like that of the perennial parent ( Camara-Hernandez and Mangelsdorf, 1981).<br />6. Challenges to perennial grains<br />6.1. Physiological tradeoffs and yield<br /><br />A central concern with the development of perennial grains is that they might not produce yields comparable to annual grains due to a trade-off in the allocation of energy between longevity and yield (DeHaan et al., 2005). However, perennial grains have more total energy to allocate between longevity and yield because they intercept more sunlight over the course of a year than their annual counterparts (e.g., Dohleman and Long, 2009 and Glover et al., 2010b). Thus, the putative physiological tradeoff does not necessarily limit the seed yield of perennial species. For example, seed set and perenniality are not mutually exclusive in Tripsacum dactyloides, a grass species ( Jackson and Dewald, 1994). Both perennial and annual species in the Lesquerella genus, which contains oilseed crops, allocate similar proportions of biomass to seeds, but perennial species have higher root and shoot growth ( Ploschuk et al., 2005). Moreover, the relationship between yield and longevity in perennial plants is better explained by a quantitative genetic model, where increases in these traits are not mutually exclusive, than by the phenotypic tradeoff model (see DeHaan et al., 2005 for a more complete discussion). Thus, in the development of perennial grain crops, breeders can potentially select for traits that simultaneously increase both perenniality and yield ( DeHaan et al., 2005).<br />6.2. Food security<br /><br />The replacement of annual with perennial grain crops could exacerbate the demand for food by the growing global population (see responses within Glover, 2005), where malnutrition affects about two thirds of the world population (WHO, 2000 and FAO, 2009). However, worldwide 1,450 M ha of cropland have been abandoned (Field et al., 2008) and 910 M ha are considered to be degraded or marginal land for cultivation (FAO, 2000), a substantial amount given the estimated total 1400–1570 M ha of arable land worldwide (FAO, 2000 and FAO, 2009). Perennial grain agriculture may be able to make use of some of this degraded or marginal land and prevent more cropland from being degraded.<br />6.3. Funding and timescale<br /><br />The development and implementation of perennial grains will likely be a long and multi-level process that will involve market investment, farmer training, and changes in agricultural policy. Although present-day breeders have more powerful molecular tools like marker-assisted selection at their disposal, current estimates of the successful breeding of perennial grain crops are at least 25–50 years away (Jackson, 1980 and Cox et al., 2006), although an upland perennial rice could be ready for cultivation in 5–10 years (Hu et al., 2003 and Sacks et al., 2006). Thus, the Land Institute has proposed a “50-Year Farm Bill” so that long-term breeding goals can supersede the limitations of short-term, five-year farm bills (Jackson and Kirschenmann, 2009). Either way, consistent institutional support and long-term commitment are critical to perennial grain development.<br />6.4. Diseases and insect pests<br /><br />Temperate perennial grain crops may face disease and insect pest management problems similar to tropical perennial crops (e.g., banana), largely because pathogens will have access to living tissue year-round (Singh and Singh, 2005 and Ploetz, 2007). In particular, leaf and stem rusts and viruses like wheat streak mosaic could present significant barriers to the successful development of perennial grain crops (Bell et al., 2010b). For example, perennial sorghum cultivars are extremely susceptible to fungal diseases in humid climates, such as the southern United States. Perennial rice might be similarly susceptible, as harvesting will likely require cutting the plant which makes it vulnerable to the fungi and bacteria that thrive in the wet environments where rice grows (S. McCouch, personal communication, September 29, 2010). To prevent higher disease incidence, pathogen resistance genes can be incorporated into perennial species through genetic modification as a method of host resistance (Scheinost et al., 2001). Disease-control chemicals, allelopathic biological control, cultural controls, and crop rotations can also be used (Bockus and Shroyer, 1998). If the perennial grain crops are grown in polycultures, this would help reduce the disease and insect problems.<br /><br />Despite potential problems, perennial crop systems might in fact be more secure in the face of disease and insect pest problems than annuals. For instance, since perennial plants foster a healthier soil, the plants can more robustly ward off and fight disease with the increased presence of symbiotic myccorhizae (Cox et al., 2005). Temperate-growing perennial grains have also developed higher levels of disease resistance than their annual relatives (DeHaan et al., 2007 and Glover et al., 2010b). Moreover, in general, perennial plants tend to have high levels of disease and insect resistance; because they spend consecutive years of life rooted in the soil, long-term natural selection has contributed to each individual plant to have more investment and genetic evolution for disease resistance. This is why genes from wild perennials are often used as sources of disease and insect resistance in improvements made to annual crops in breeding programs. For instance, the offspring from crosses between wheat and its perennial relatives are frequently resistant to diseases to which annual wheat normally is prone (Glover et al., 2010a). In terms of disease resistance, a perennial maize in particular might have an advantage given the vast number of quantitative resistance traits a breeder has available due to the great genetic diversity within maize germplasm (Buckler et al., 2001).<br />6.5. Weeds<br /><br />Because a perennial crop may be slow to establish and then remains in the ground for multiple seasons over multiple years, they are more susceptible than traditional annuals to weed invasion, particularly during the establishment period when uncontrolled weeds can cause poor establishment and crop failure (Buhler et al., 1998). Whether herbicides are used or not, perennial grain growers will need to anticipate weed problems and can take other measures to minimize problems. Inter-planting the perennial grain crop with a legume crop can reduce potential weed problems (Pimentel et al., 2005).<br /><br />It is also worth noting that perennial grain species, namely wild perennial rice, are themselves considered a weedy species, and efforts to combat uncontrolled intermingling with annual grains merit attention. O. longistaminata and O. rufipogon (so called “red rice”) are persistent species that are so economically destructive to the value of annual white rice that U.S. law bans planting of perennial rice. Thus, the cultivation of perennial rice should address these concerns to avoid the potential problems of weedy perennial rice.<br />6.6. Farmer profitability<br /><br />One of the fundamental concerns over widespread adoption of perennial grain cultivation is that they may not be economically viable for farmers, or viable only in specific contexts, such as mixed crop-forage operations (e.g., Bell et al., 2008). Yet others contend that the reduced inputs needed for perennial grains may make them more profitable for farmers (Glover et al., 2010b).<br /><br />To explicitly address this debate, we provide estimates of the production costs and profit of wheat agriculture in the United States between 2004 and 2009. Perennial wheat is the most developed perennial crop, estimates and assumed benchmarks of the inputs and yields of perennial wheat are available to be contrasted with statistics of traditional annual wheat (Bell et al., 2008 and Glover et al., 2010a) to provide comparisons of costs and profit of annual wheat to hypothetical returns of perennial wheat (see Table 1). We do not include monetary estimates of reduced soil erosion, water quality and increased wildlife habitat as these benefits are largely external to the profit maximization decisions of an individual farmer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 1.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average (2004–2009) of annual United States wheat production costs and returns ($USD/ha), excluding government payments (USDA-ERS, 2012), and comparisons with perennial wheat agriculture under assumptions outlined in Bell et al.

(2010b) and reductions in harvest and seed costs as outlined in Bell et al. (2008).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes revenue from straw and grazing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We assume all customs application operations are for herbicide and insecticide application, and will decrease in same proportion as herbicide and pesticide use (see Epplin, 2007).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuel use is based on West and Marland (2002), and fuel for pesticide and herbicide treatment is assumed to be included in custom operation charges.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We assume that the reductions in repair and labor costs for perennial wheat are similar to no-till production costs (Epplin, 2007). This likely underestimates savings in labor and repairs by perennial grain agriculture.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We assume all other fixed costs and machinery costs are equal between annual and perennial systems. Based on cost reductions from switching from conventional to no-till operations, this assumption may underestimate savings in machinery costs from perennial wheat production (see Epplin, 2007 and Glover et al., 2010b).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table options<br /><br />We compare perennial and annual wheat agriculture using two scenarios. The first scenario mimics the conditions used by Bell et al. (2008) which assumes a moderate decrease in fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide application, lower seed costs and a 60% yield of perennial grain as compared to annual grain yields. The second scenario assumes no fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide application, as described by Glover et al. (2010a), and seed costs and grain yield as reported in Bell et al. (2008). The reductions in fuel and custom application charges were calculated using West and Marland (2002) for reduced tillage and fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide use. We assume that fuel savings from all herbicide and pesticide application are associated with custom applications charges. Reductions in farm labor and repairs are calculated using studies comparing conventional tillage and no-till operations for wheat production (Epplin, 2007). Because no-till operations still utilize annual wheat, the savings of perennial grains would likely be greater than shown in Table 1 for labor and repair costs. We do not attempt in either scenario to calculate savings in machinery fixed costs that would likely arise from reduced tillage, insecticide and herbicide application under perennial crop techniques (Epplin, 2007). Thus operating costs could be lower for perennial wheat production than presented in Table 1.<br /><br />The assumption that yields of perennial wheat are lower than annual wheat is consistent with empirical findings that indicate lower yields from perennial varieties (Murphy et al., 2009). However, yields of perennial cultivars can be as high as 75% of annual counterparts (Murphy et al., 2009). Moreover, relatively high yields of perennial wheat with no input of fertilizer have been reported. Thus, the assumption of a 40% reduction in perennial yield is not unreasonable.<br /><br />We also assume that perennial grain has the same market value as annual wheat. While the lack of a functioning market for perennial wheat might appear insoluble, flour from domesticated intermediate wheatgrass is sold as a specialty product (Strand, 2010). Moreover, perennial cultivars do have much higher protein content and micronutrients than annual wheat (Murphy et al., 2009 and Strand, 2010), and these characteristics could be leveraged to create markets for high quality perennial grain products.<br /><br />While these data are not meant to replace a formal economic analysis, these estimates indicate that a perennial wheat crop could be an economically viable alternative to annual crop systems. In particular, reductions in fuel, fertilizer and labor costs can be substantial, offsetting reductions in yield. Further economic analyses of perennial crops will prove valuable in the development of perennial agricultural systems.<br />Acknowledgments<br /><br />We wish to express our sincere gratitude to the Cornell Association of Professors Emeriti for the partial support of our research through the Albert Podell Grant Program.<br /><br />We had the following 5 scientists review an earlier draft of this manuscript and included some of their valuable and constructive suggestions in this draft of the manuscript:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William R.

And as the population grows, so too does demand for land and energy which,<br />together with climate change, will further hinder agriculture’s ability to produce enough food to sustain<br />society. Therefore, many researchers agree that agriculture is the “largest threat to biodiversity and<br />ecosystem functions of any single human activity” [7].To quote from the 2005 synthesis report of the<br />United Nations’ Millennium Ecosystem Assessment program, “Cultivation often has a negative impact on<br />provision of [ecosystem] services. For example, cultivated systems tend to use more water, increase water<br />pollution and soil erosion, store less carbon, emit more greenhouse gases, and support significantly less<br />habitat and biodiversity than the ecosystems they replace” [5].<br />At present, more than two-thirds of global cropland is sown to monocultures of annual crops, much<br />land most suitable for annual crops is already in use; and production of nonfood goods (e.g., biofuels)<br />increasingly competes with food production for land [19]. The best lands have soils at low or moderate<br />risk of degradation under annual grain production but make up only 12.6% of global land area (16.5<br />million km2) [20]. Supporting more than 50% of world population is another 43.7 million km2 of marginal<br />lands (33.5% of global land area), at high risk of degradation under annual grain production but otherwise<br />capable of producing crops [20]. With more land worldwide having been converted from perennial to<br />annual cover since 1950 than in the previous 150 years [6], the area occupied by annual species continues<br />to expand, the threat of soil degradation looms larger. This recent expansion of cropland has made it more<br />and more necessary to apply chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which disrupt natural nutrient cycles and<br />erode biodiversity [22, 31, 5].<br />Perennial crops would address many agricultural problems as well as substantial ecological and<br />economic benefits, relative to annual crop species, they can produce more ground cover, and perform<br />longer growing seasons and more extensive root systems, which make them more competitive against<br />weeds and more effective at capturing nutrients and water. Thereby, perennial crops can be used in<br />reducing soil erosion [25]; minimize nutrient leaching [12]; sequester more C in soils [15]; and provide<br />continuous habitat for wildlife [13]. In addition, mixtures of species in intercrops or polycultures have the<br />potential to improve the performance of a cropping system in terms of yield, nutrient cycling efficiency,<br />and other pests control [21, 33]. In a field experiment encompassing 100 years of data collection, annual<br />crops were 50 times more susceptible to soil erosion than were perennial pasture crops [16], and annual<br />grain crops can lose five times as much water and 35 times as much nitrate as perennial crops [28].This<br />paper reviews some of advantages of perennial crop in ecological benefits, introduces the important role<br />of perennial crop at the development of sustainable agriculture system as well as prospects the significant<br />utilization and potential of perennial crop on sustainability of agriculture and environment.<br />2. Advantages of perennial crop<br />Before the introduction of agriculture, almost all of the world’s landscapes were covered primarily by<br />perennial plants growing in mixed stands [6]; However, through 10 000 years of plant domestication, not<br />one perennial species was domesticated for grain production. The prevalence of annuals among<br />domesticated, grain-bearing species is often thought to warrant little discussion. For instance, Blumler<br />and Byrne [3] wrote simply that perennial grains were not domesticated because they ‘are less subject to<br />selection pressures since stands are not replaced each year. In addition, perennials usually outcross.’ But a<br />more detailed look at the differences in susceptibility to domestication of perennial and annual species 10<br />millennia ago can provide additional insights into that process while at the same time informing presentday attempts to domesticate perennial herbaceous species for grain production and sustainable agriculture.<br /><br />Yanming Zhang et al. / Procedia Environmental Sciences 10 (2011) 1141 – 1147<br /><br />The development of perennial crops through breeding would help address the multiple issues involving<br />environmental conservation and food security; they offer a new solution to the long-standing problems of<br />soil erosion and degradation associated with conventional annual small-grain cropping systems. Perennial<br />crops tend to have longer growing seasons and deeper rooting depths, and they intercept, retain, and<br />utilize more precipitation [31]. Longer photosynthetic seasons resulting from earlier canopy development<br />and longer green leaf duration increase seasonal light interception efficiencies, an important factor in<br />plant productivity [14]. Greater root mass reduces erosion risks and maintains more soil carbon compared<br />with annual crops [18]. In addition, perennial crops require fewer passes of farm equipment and less<br />fertilizer and herbicide [17], important attributes in regions most needing agricultural advancement.<br />“No-till” cropping that annual crops are farmed without tillage, reduces soil loss but requires<br />heavy chemical inputs for control of weeds and other pests. When it improves the soil permeability<br />of previously tilled land, no-till cropping of annual species decreases nutrient runoff, but it does not<br />address the increasingly serious problem of nutrients and water leaching from annual crop fields into<br />groundwater and eventually into rivers and seas [27,32]. Nitrogen losses from annual crops may be<br />30 to 50 times higher than those from perennial crops [27]. Organic farming of annual crops<br />addresses the problem of pesticide contamination but not the physical erosion of soil. And organic<br />systems do not compensate for the relative inefficiency of annual species in capturing water and<br />nutrients. For example, with no fertilizer inputs and without the benefits of centuries of domestication,<br />the perennial grass Miscanthus has 61% greater annual solar radiation interception efficiency by the plant<br />canopy and can produce 59% more above ground biomass than heavily fertilized, highly domesticated<br />annual maize [14]. Regrowth of perennial crop stems and leaves after seed harvest may allow for<br />additional harvests of biomass for livestock feed or biofuels [2].<br />In parts of Australia, one of the globe’s most striking results of annual cropping has been the<br />emergence of soil salinisation. Citing a survey of Lucerne research by Ward [34], they projected that<br />escape of rainwater below the root zone (which can lead to rising water tables and salinisation) could be<br />reduced 90 percent by replacing annual wheat with perennial wheat. Perennial wheat might be used in<br />rotation in drier areas or in long-term stands in higher-rainfall zones. In addition, Bell et al. [2] concluded<br />that “perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a<br />profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers.” In the central plains of the U.S., the ultimate goal<br />of perennial crop is a system that serves the ecological functions that the original prairie did. In Asia,<br />systems involving perennial upland rice and food-producing trees could prevent erosion on lands that are<br />highly susceptible.<br />In traditional sustainable agriculture, researchers are making the most of currently available perennial<br />plants, by attempting to increase coverage of landscapes with perennial hay and pasture crops; grow<br />perennial biofuel crops; plant more trees and grass along rivers and streams to take up nutrients and other<br />contaminants that escape cropland; and take more erodible lands out of grain production altogether. [24].<br />3. Approaches to breeding perennial crops<br />Before perennial grain-cropping systems can be deployed and tested, new, perennial cereal, grain<br />legume, and/or oilseed crops must be developed through breeding [8,10]. Two traditional approaches to<br />developing these crops are direct domestication and wide hybridization, which have led to the wide<br />variety of crops on which humans now rely. The first approach begins with identification of perennial<br />species that have high and consistent seed production relative to other wild species and perhaps other<br />beneficial traits, but it needs more time for cyclic selection within those species to increase the frequency<br />of genes for traits of domestication such as synchronous flowering and maturity, large seeds, and so on.<br />With the advantages of genetic knowledge and technology, however, today’s perennial grain breeders can<br /><br />1143<br /><br />1144<br /><br />Yanming Zhang et al. / Procedia Environmental Sciences 10 (2011) 1141 – 1147<br /><br />expect to make more rapid progress than did ancient domesticators of annual plants. The second approach<br />to perennial grain breeding is a way of shortening the domestication process by taking advantage of<br />useful genetic variation already fixed in high-yielding crop cultivars. In nature, perennial species are<br />secondary or tertiary gene pools for many annual grains, Wide hybridization can bring together genes for<br />domestication traits and the perennial life history. Currently, such interspecific and intergeneric hybrids<br />are being used by a part of breeding programs as a base from which to develop perennial grain-producing<br />crops. [8,10]. For instance, of the world’s 13 most widely grown grain or oilseed crops, 10 are capable of<br />being hybridized with perennial relatives (table 1), including rice, wheat, rye, sorghum and sunflowers [8].<br />Table 1.

[11] predicted that artificial selection in a properly managed agricultural environment<br />could increase seed yield while maintaining perenniality. Applied to agronomic traits and perennial<br />growth habit simultaneously, artificial selection has the potential to generate perennial grain crops with<br />acceptable yields. Four characteristics of perennial plants differentiate them from annual plants and<br />provide them with extra resources that, through selection, can be re-allocated to grain production:<br />• Better access to resources and a longer growing season [30],<br />• More conservative use of nutrients [10],<br />• Generally higher biomass production [26], and<br />• Sustainable production on marginal lands [4].<br /><br />Yanming Zhang et al. / Procedia Environmental Sciences 10 (2011) 1141 – 1147<br /><br />Although current breeding efforts focused on developing perennial grain crops have been under way<br />for less than a decade, the idea isn’t new. Efforts in the former Soviet Union and the United States to<br />develop perennial wheat in the 1960s were abandoned in part because of plant sterility and undesirable<br />agronomic characteristics [10].Recently ,the Land Institute in the United States, Australia’s Future Farm<br />Industries Cooperative Research Centre, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China, and<br />other research groups are conducting or initiating breeding programs in intermediate wheatgrass<br />[Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth &amp; D. R. Dewey], perennial wheat (Triticum spp. /<br />Thinopyrum spp.), perennial sorghum [Sorghum bicolour (L.) Moench / S. halepense (L.) Pers.],<br />Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani Schrad.), perennial sunflower (complex hybrids of<br />Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michaux) MacMillan), and perennial<br />rice (hybrids of Oryza spp.) [9]. Meanwhile, recent advances in plant breeding, such as the use of marker<br />assisted selection, genomic in situ hybridization, transgenic technologies, and embryo rescue, coupled<br />with traditional breeding techniques, make the development of perennial grain crops possible in the next<br />10 to 20 years.<br />4. Conclusion<br />Nowadays, researchers make an agreement that perennial crops grown for biomass, forage, or food<br />production, can produce agronomic and environmental benefits derived from perennial cover and species<br />diversity [23]. If efforts, to develop economically competitive perennial crops and post-harvest processing<br />technologies capable of utilizing more perennial crops prove successful, then large areas of land currently<br />being degraded or at high risk of degradation under annual crop production could be farmed more<br />sustainably [17]. Given the time required to make significant changes in agricultural production, the<br />extent to which perennial crops are featured on farms 20 yrs hence largely depends on current decisions<br />made by agricultural scientists and policymakers. Therefore, by improving of plant breeding and fertility<br />management, enhancing the policy and finance support, and closer cooperation between agricultural<br />scientists, perennial cropping systems could greatly outperform annual systems in terms of sustainability<br />of agriculture and environment, which significant agronomic and ecological benefits would be realized in<br />the future.<br />Acknowledgements<br />We gratefully acknowledge Postdoctoral Research Funds of Heilongjiang Province (LBH-Z10034) and<br />Academic Core Funding of Youth Projects of Harbin Normal University (KGB200918).<br />References<br />[1] [FAO] Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.(2005).

In agriculture, rhizomes have two contrasting roles. On one hand, strong rhizomes are a desirable trait for many species of turf and forage grasses. On the other hand, strong rhizomes are a negative trait contributing to the competitiveness and invasiveness of many grasses which are noxious weeds in crop fields [2].<br />In many mountainous areas where people depend upon annual crops for subsistence, development and cultivation of perennial crop cultivars with strong rhizomes have been proposed as an environmentally sound<br /><br />© 2011 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

For example, upland rice is grown annually in many steep hillsides of tropical Asia as the primary food crop for sustainable farmers. But growing upland rice in the hilly areas often causes severe soil erosion and damages the ecosystem in these areas. Thus, breeding perennial upland rice varieties with strong rhizomes could be an effective way to resolve this problem because rhizomes of a perennial cultivar would trap soil and minimize soil disturbance associated with annual tillage.<br />As the staple food for more than half of the world's population, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the model system for genetic and genomic studies of grasses. Of the two cultivated and 22 wild species of rice, O. longistaminata from Africa is the only wild perennial species that has both strong rhizomatous stems and the same AA genome as O. sativa [6,7]. Thus, O. longistaminata provides a model system for genetic and molecular dissection of the rhizomatous trait in grasses. Previous genetic studies have shown that rhizome expression in O. longistaminata is controlled either by two complementary lethal genes, D1 and D2 [8,9], or by a single major gene loosely linked to the lg locus on chromosome 4 plus several modifying genes [10]. Using an F2 and two backcross populations derived from crosses between an O. longistaminata accession and an O. sativa line, RD23, Hu et al. (2003) reported that the rhizome expression in O. longistaminata is controlled by two dominant-complementary genes, Rhz2 and Rhz3 on rice chromosome 3 and 4 [11]. Comparative analysis further revealed that each gene closely corresponds to a major QTL controlling rhizome expression in Sorghum propinquum. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were also identified, and found to correspond to the locations of the rhizome-controlling QTLs in S. propinquum [11]. All these results provided the basis for cloning genes related to the rhizomatous traits in rice.<br />Because plant rhizomes and tillers both originate from axillary buds on the most basal portion of the seedling shoot [12], genes controlling plant axillary bud initiation and outgrowth may also contribute to rhizome development and growth. Several genes involved in rice axillary bud initiation or outgrowth have been cloned. MONOCULM1 (MOC1), a member of the GRAS transcription factor family, is the first cloned gene which is involved in the axillary bud initiation and tiller outgrowth in rice [13]. The second one is OsTB1 which acts as a negative regulator controlling tiller outgrowth in rice [14]. Two other genes, LAX and SPA, were identified as the main regulators of the axillary meristem formation in rice [15] and LAX1 function is required for all types of axillary meristems at both the vegetative and reproductive<br /><br />phases of rice [16]. Recently, the DWARF gene was reported to be functionally involved in tiller bud outgrowth [17]. Although the functions of these genes and molecular mechanisms in rice tiller development have largely been characterized, it remains to be elucidated whether the molecular mechanism controlling rhizome initiation and elongation is parallel to that of the tiller development.<br />With the availability of the whole genome sequence in rice [18], several rice genome arrays have been developed by Affymetrix, Agilent, NSF, Yale University and BGI [19-23]. These DNA microarrays have been used for many purposes, especially for genome-wide transcriptome analyses in different cells/tissues/organs or developmental stages of rice. Previously, different research groups have shown that the rice cell transcriptome exhibits both qualitative and quantitative differences consistent with the specialized functions of different cell types [24], and unique gene sets are exclusively expressed in different tissues/organs at different developmental stages of rice [25-28]. Using a cDNA macroarray, a set of genes and their cis-elements motifs with rhizome-enriched expression were identified in sorghum [2]. Comparative analysis showed that many of these highly expressed sorghum rhizome genes were aligned to the previously identified rhizome-related QTL regions in rice and sorghum, providing an important basis for further molecular dissection of rhizome development in grasses.<br />Following our previous study in genetic dissection of rhizomatousness in O. longistaminata, we report here an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms of tissue specificity in O. longistaminata by exploring the genome-wide gene expression patterns. Our results provide insights into the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizomatousness in O. longistaminata.<br />Results<br />Global changes of gene expression in five different<br />tissues Rhizomes, which are underground stems, are expected to be closely related developmentally to aboveground stems. In this study, of the five different tissues, rhizome tips (RT) and rhizome internodes (RI) were chosen because they are known to contain tissue-specifically expressed genes responsible for rhizome development and growth [2], whereas shoot tips (ST), shoot internodes (SI) were chosen to represent cells at a later stage of development, and young leaves (YL) to establish the activity of housekeeping genes unrelated to rhizomeand stem-specific development. Thus, comparisons between expressed genes from different tissues allow us to discover specific sets of genes responsible for rhizome development and growth.<br /><br />Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:18 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/18<br /><br />Page 3 of 14<br /><br />The microarray experiments identified a total of 21,372 genes that were expressed in at least one of the five sampled tissues of O. longistaminata, including 16,981 genes expressed in RT, 15,662 genes expressed in RI, 16026 genes expressed in ST, 15,732 genes expressed in SI, and 15,294 genes expressed in YL. These include 10,801 genes that were expressed in all five tissues, and 2,566 genes that were specifically expressed in only one of the five tissues (Additional files 1, 2). The two tip tissues (RT and ST) had similar genome expression patterns, and so did the two internode tissues (RI and SI). The greatest difference in expression pattern was observed between the tip tissues and YL (Figure 1 and Additional file 1).<br />The tissue-enriched genes in five tissues in O.<br />longistaminata and their inferred functions Multiclass analyses and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests of the expression data led us to the identification of a total of 2,566 tissue-specific genes, including 58, 61, 299, 29 and 1,974 unique genes specifically enriched in RT, RI, ST, SI and YL, respectively (Table 1, Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). These tissue-specifically expressed genes represent the most important set of genes that determine the specificities and functions of the five sampled tissues. As expected, genes specifically expressed in each tissue have inferred functions strongly related to the known functions of the corresponding tissues.<br />YL has 1974 tissue-specially expressed genes, far more than the other tissues (Additional file 6). This is not surprising since plant leaves contain the primary machinery for photosynthesis. As expected, most of these YL enriched genes were related to photosynthesis, metabolism, transport, signal transduction, etc, of known physiological functions of leaves. These included genes encoding photosystem I and II components, the PGR5 protein involved in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I and essential for photoprotection [29], RPT2 (a signal transducer involved in phototropic response and stomata opening) [30], ZEITLUPE and early flowering proteins related to the circadian clock function and early photomorphogenesis [31,32] and AS2, a protein required for the formation of a symmetric flat leaf lamina [33].<br />In ST, the 299 specifically enriched genes were mainly functionally classified as cell cycle, cell wall components and biogenesis, DNA replication and repairing, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation involved in shoot morphogenesis (additional file 4). These included 60 genes encode transcription factor proteins, such as TCP (Os03g57190), FL (Os04g51000), OsSBP5, and a growth regulating factor (Os06g02560), which are reported to be involved in the regulation of shoot apical meristem activities and morphogenesis of shoot organs [34-37].

In the color panels, each horizontal line represents a single gene and the color of the line shows the expression level of the gene relative to the median in a specific sample: high expression in red, low expression in green. The row data represented here is provided in Additional file 2. Results from the three replicates of the microarray experiments were consistent, indicating the consistency of the gene expression patterns in the five sampled tissues. Two subsets of genes are apparent. Rhizome tips (labeled 1) and shoot tips (labeled 2) show high expression of genes near the top of the panel and moderate or low expression of genes below, while leaves (labeled 5) show low or moderate expression of genes near the top of the panel and high expression of genes below. Rhizome internodes (labeled 3) and stem internodes (labeled 4) show moderate or low expression of both subsets. The difference between rhizomes and shoots appears small in comparison with the difference between tips and internodes of both organs.<br /><br />Hu et al.

Two genes encoding PINHEAD proteins were also ST-enriched, which are involved in the fate determination of central shoot meristem cells [39,40].<br />Most of the 29 SI-enriched genes encode proteins of unknown function, but a few are inferred to be related to metabolism, signal transduction, and redox regulation (Additional file 5). Of these, a BCL-2 binding anthanogene-1 gene reportedly has functions in regulating development and apoptosis-like processes during pathogen attack and abiotic stress [41]. Another gene of interest encodes the cytokinin synthase involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinin [42].<br />Of the 61 RI-enriched genes (Additional file 3), 11 encode proteins with transport functions, including three proteins containing heavy-metal-associated domains, a transmembrane amino acid transporter; 7 proteins related to cell cycle and cell wall biogenesis (including a dirigent-like protein, a glycine rich protein and a pectinesterase inhibitor-domain containing protein), and one gene encoding a flavin-binding monooxygenase-like family protein which has the inferred function in auxin biosynthesis [43].<br />Of specific interest are the 58 RT-specifically expressed genes (Table 1). Of these, 15 are related to transcription regulation, including an agamous-like MADS box gene (AGL12), 2 YABBY genes (Os07g06620 and Os07g0160100), and a TCP gene (Os03g49880). Three genes encoding homeobox proteins such as OSH1 were of this group. Several genes with functionality in cell elongation and cell cycle, including alpha-expansin 10, CEN2 and CEN3, were also highly enriched in RT.<br />To confirm the microarray data, a set of 21 tissueenriched genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis. The RT-PCR expression pattern of 18 out of the 21 genes was consistent with that of the microarray experiments (Additional file 7). The RT-PCR profiles of the remaining three genes failed to confirm the microarray results. This inconsistency was likely due to the difference between the two methods in detecting different<br /><br />members of gene families. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR detects the expression patterns of individual genes characterized by a single peak in the melting curve, while microarray analysis cannot distinguish different members of the same gene family.<br />Comparison between the differentially expressed genes in RT and ST The principal components (PC) analysis based on the 10,801 genes that were expressed in all five tissues, which clearly differentiated the tissues from one another (Figure 2). Results from the three replicates of the microarray experiments were very consistent, indicating the high quality and consistency of the gene expression patterns in the five sampled tissues. Interestingly, PC1, which explained 63.7% of the total variation in expression level of this set of genes, did not contribute much to the differences between the five tissues. In contrast, PC2, which explained 17.5% of the expression variation of this set of genes, contributed greatly to the difference between RT/ST and RI, and between YL and SI, indicating that most genes contributing to PC2 are those differentiating leaves and internodes. PC3 explained 9.0% of the total expression variation of these genes and was primarily responsible for the difference between RT and ST. These results clearly indicate that there are significant quantitative differences in gene expression level among different tissues that contribute significantly to cell and tissue differentiation.<br />Of the differentially expressed genes, 162 and 261 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in RT as compared to ST (Additional file 8). The function classification of all RT differentially expressed genes is shown in Figure 3. Many genes related to photosynthesis were greatly down-regulated and additional genes involved in transcription regulation and transport were repressed in RT. Of these, three auxin response-related genes were significantly down-regulated in RT as compared with ST. Several transcription factor genes related to shoot growth and development were also down-regulated in RT relative to ST (Additional file 7). These genes include TCP<br /><br />Hu et al.

PC1 separates leaves and shoot internodes from the other three organs. PC2 distinguishes among tips, internodes, and leaves. PC3 separates tips from internodes.<br /><br />(Os03g57190), SHOOT1, APETALA1, CONSTANS (Os04g42020), AGL19 and a no-apical-meristem protein gene (Os04g38720). Among the down-regulated genes, several genes (ARF8, Auxin Efflux Carrier 3, AS2, and SBP5) with known functions were identified as ST-enriched ones. The up-regulated genes in RT include those encoding two CEN-like proteins, two meiosis 5 proteins, two GA response proteins, and two auxin-responsive proteins. Also, the expression levels of two meiosis 5 protein genes (Os06g35970 and Os02g13660) were 8.0 and 14.0 times higher in RT than in ST. Twenty-four transcription factor genes encoding WRKY, NAC, bHLH, homeobox, flowering promoting factor-like 1, bZIP, AP2, and GBOF1 proteins, etc, were up-regulated. Seven genes encoding lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which function as transporters, were highly up-regulated in the RT. In addition, five proline-rich protein (PRP) genes clustered on chromosome 10 were also up-regulated in RT relative to the ST.<br /><br />Identification of distinct cis-regulatory elements in the<br />genes specifically expressed in particular tissues Using the PLACE cis-element database, the cis-elements of the tissue-enriched genes were determined from both strands of their putative promoter sequences. We selected the top 65 genes from different gene sets for cis-element comparative analysis (Tables 2 and 3). Several distinct elements were found in significantly different proportions among different tissue-enriched gene sets (Table 2) and between RT up-regulated and downregulated gene sets (Table 3).<br />Of the six tissue-enriched gene sets, a CGACG motif was the predominant cis-element in the RI-enriched genes relative to the other four tissues. This element was originally reported to function as a coupling element for the G box element [44]. An element of GCCGCC (GCCCORE, [45]) was found to be more abundant in RI than in SI.

An AACGG (Myb core, [47]) element was enriched in RI and ST relative to the other tissues. Two additional cis-elements, the RY repeat (CATGCA, [48]) and TAAAG motif [49], were found to be significantly more abundant in the up-regulated genes set of RT as compared to other tissues.<br />Co-localization of rhizome related QTLs and rhizomespecific expressed genes in rice and sorghum In our previous study [11], we genetically identified the QTLs related to rhizome expression, abundance and growth related traits using an F2 population from the cross between RD23 and Oryza longistaminata. Sixteen QTLs were localized on 12 regions of the eight rice chromosomes that affected the nine rhizome traits. Of these, two dominant-complementary genes (Rhz2 and Rhz3) controlling the rhizomatous expression were mapped on chromosomes 3 and 4. Interestingly, many<br /><br />the RT- and RI-enriched genes and RT differentially regulated genes detected in the microarray experiments were mapped to the above-mentioned QTL likelihood intervals (Additional file 9).<br />Specifically, 34 of the RT- and RI-enriched genes were physically mapped on 11 rhizome-related QTL regions (Additional file 9). A gene encoding MATE-type transporter (Os0311734) associated with Rhz2 was highly repressed in RT relative to ST, while five RT up- or down-regulated genes were mapped on the Rhz3 region. Of these, a BADH gene (Os0439020) and a putative gene (Os0436670) of unknown function were highly up-regulated. Three other genes including a NAM transcription factor (Os04g38720) were down-regulated in RT. One gene encoding monosaccharide transporter 1 was downregulated in RI as compared to SI. The homolog of this gene was also rhizome-specific expressed in sorghum [2]. Sixteen RT-specific expressed genes were identified in regions of five mapped QTLs (QRn2, QRn3, QRn5, QRn6<br /><br />Hu et al.

Other positional candidate genes in these QTL regions include MAP3K, Expansin S1, Hsp70, LTP1, SL-TPS/P, and genes encoding gibberellin-regulated protein 2 (Os06g51320) and naringenin-chalcone synthase (Os10g33370). In the regions of three QTLs (QRl1, QRl6 and QRl7) controlling rhizome length, we identified nine RT-specific differentially regulated genes, which include a histone-like transcription factor (Os07g41580) and a homeodomain leucine zipper protein (Os07g39320).<br />We were able to align 26 of the rhizome-specific expressed genes on the sorghum genome using a comparative genomics tool, Phytozome v5.0 http://www.phytozome.net/, and found that 12 of these genes colocalize with the sorghum rhizome-related QTLs [1] (Additional file 9). All these genes will provide putative functional candidates for the identified rhizome-related QTLs and are worth of further study.<br /><br />Discussion Annual upland rice grown in many hilly areas of tropical Asia provides essential food for poor sustainable farmers, but continuously growing this type of annual crops has caused severe soil erosion and environmental degradation in these areas [50]. Development of perennial grain crops with underground shoots (rhizomes) has been proposed as a vital alternative to solve the problem and to improve farm profitability in these areas [51]. Doing so requires full understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the growth and development of rhizomes, a key component of perenniality in many grass species. In this study, we used the Affymetrix oligomer microarray chips to profile the tissue-specific genome expression of O. longistaminata to discover and characterize genes and putative pathways responsible specifically for initiation and elongation of rhizomes in rice. As expected, we identified two distinct<br /><br />Table 3 Three cis-elements abundant in genes up-regulated and down-regulated in the rhizome tips (RT) of O. longistaminata<br /><br />Gene set<br /><br />RT Up-regulated<br /><br />RT Down-regulated<br /><br />No. of tested genes<br /><br />Total (%)<br /><br />CGACG element (CGACG)<br /><br />Single copy (%)<br /><br />Two or more copies (%)<br /><br />Total (%)<br /><br />RY repeat (CATGCA)<br /><br />Single copy (%)<br /><br />Two or more copies (%)<br /><br />Total (%)<br /><br />TAAAG motif (TAAAG)<br /><br />Single copy (%)<br /><br />Two or more copies (%)<br /><br />64 73.4 ± 11.6<br />31.2 42.2 82.8 ± 9.9* 50.0 32.8 96.9 ± 4.5* 59.4 37.5<br /><br />62 91.9 ± 7.1*<br />37.1 54.8 58.1 ± 12.8 42.0 16.1 79 ± 10.6 43.5 35.5<br /><br />*The range about the average indicates 95% confidence limits for p.<br /><br />Hu et al.

We realized that the Affymetrix oligomer microarray chips used in this study contain genes from O. sativa, but not from O. longistaminata. Thus, it is certain that some O. longistaminata-specific genes are missing in the chips and thus undetectable in this study. Nevertheless, the small set of rhizome specifically and differentially expressed genes detected in this study are, though incomplete, important in determining rhizome initiation and development in O. longistaminata. Detailed examination of the functions of this set of genes provides insights into molecular mechanisms associated with rhizome development and growth in O. longistaminata.<br />Putative candidate genes for rhizome growth and development in O. longistaminata RT is the most important tissue for rhizome development because they contain apical meristems consisting of pluripotent cells for rhizome initiation after embryogenesis. Thus, specifically and differentially expressed genes in RT are expected to be associated with early events in the rhizome development of O. longistaminata and thus are important candidates worthy of further study. Of particular interest is a group of regulatory genes that were highly enriched in RT. These include three homeobox genes of the OSH1 family, which is known to function as plant master regulators in the process of organ morphogenesis [52-54]. The TCP and YABBY genes of plant-specific transcription factor families are also important candidates, as they reportedly function in the development of plant lateral organs such as tiller initiation and elongation [36,55-57], suggesting the presence of overlapping regulatory mechanism(s) controlling plant underground rhizomes and aerial tillers. Additional candidates include AGL12 and OsEXP10. The former is known to be preferentially expressed in the primary root meristem and plays an important role in root development [58,59]. The latter is induced by GA and involved in cell elongation [60]. Two genes encoding CEN-like proteins 2 and 3 are also important candidates because they play distinct roles in regulating the activities of secondary meristem in the uppermost phytomeres [61].<br />Genes with distinct expression patterns and functions differentiating RT and ST Our results revealed very similar transcriptional programs between RT and ST. This is not surprising since the underground RT and aboveground ST are largely developed from homologous meristems [62]. However, a relatively small set of genes that were differentially expressed between RT and ST are of particular interest because they may have important molecular mechanism<br /><br />(s) for rhizomatousness in rice. For example, several auxin/IAA-related genes were greatly down-regulated in RT but highly enriched in ST. These include ARF8 and Auxin Efflux Carrier 3 which are known to play important roles in phytohormone signaling and control the activity of lateral meristems [63,64]. In contrast, several genes involved in GA biosynthesis were highly enriched in RT as compared to ST. These include genes encoding gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase (Os01g55240) and GA regulated protein (Os06g51320) [65]. These results suggest that auxin acts as a negative regulator in rhizome development and an activator for shoot growth, while GA acts as the activator in rhizome development. The suppression of genes encoding chlorophyll-binding and light-harvesting proteins for photosynthesis in RT was expected and consistent with the fact that the underground rhizomes do not have any functions in photosynthesis.<br />An interesting observation of this study was the significantly enhanced expression of genes in the gene families with ""redundant"" function(s) in RT. These include 2 CEN-like genes and 2 Meiosis 5 genes involved in apical meristem development [66], 5 genes encoding proline-rich proteins that are major components of plant cell walls [67,68], and seven lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) genes involved in cuticle synthesis and cell wall expansion [69]. All these results suggest that rhizome development tends to result from different members of large gene families with related but differentiated functions, consistent with a previous report that gene family members were frequently expressed with stage- or tissue-specific patterns [70].<br />Important cis-regulatory elements in genes for rhizome<br />development In this study, several cis-elements were found overrepresented in one or more tissue-enriched gene sets. A core of sulfur-responsive element (SURE) containing an auxin response factor binding sequence [46] is enriched in RT-specifically expressed genes, suggesting that auxin may mediate gene regulation during rhizome development. Three cis-elements with motifs of CGACG, GCCGCC or AACGG were enriched in the 5' upstream regions of RI-enriched genes. These elements are involved in the cell cycle, jasminic acid (JA) responsiveness and sugar signaling [44,45,47], suggesting their possible functions in cell elongation, phytohormone regulation and metabolite regulation in the rhizome internodes. Two additional motifs, CATGCA and TAAAG, were in abundance in up- and down-regulated genes in RI and RT. The former was identified as an RY repeat in the RY/G-Box complex functioning in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway [48]. The latter was suggested as having a role for the Dof transcription<br /><br />Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:18 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/18<br /><br />Page 10 of 14<br /><br />factor in regulating guard cell-specific gene expression in ABA responsiveness [49,71]. All these results indicate that phytohormones such as auxin, JA and ABA play important roles in rhizome initiation and elongation, but details on how these phytohormones regulate rhizome initiation and elongation remains to be elucidated.<br />QTL candidate genes associated with rhizome abundance and length By aligning the functional candidate genes identified in the microarray analysis on the QTL regions associated with rhizome-related traits identified previously, we were able to identify a small number of QTL candidate genes for rhizomatousness in O. longistaminata. The most important one is a NAM transcription factor gene (Oso4g38720) in the Rhz3 interval, which was highly repressed in RT relative to ST. This kind of transcription factor gene is known to play crucial regulatory roles in rice growth and development. Importantly, the NAM proteins are involved in the formation of shoot apical meristem and lateral shoots [72]. Repressed expression of this gene in RT might reveal its negative regulation role in rhizome development. The MAP3K gene associated with QRn2 has been related to mediating the signal transduction of hormone and light, and required for regulating cell polarity and motility [73]. Enhanced activity of MAP3K in RT may be important to rhizome initiation as well as to the cell multiplication of rhizome apical meristem. The Expansin S1 on the QRn3 region is involved in enhancing growth by mediating cell wall loosening [74], so high abundance of Expansin S1 protein in RT should be responsible for rhizome elongation. LTPs are thought to function in lipid transfer between membranes as well as having other roles in plant development. LTP1, identified as a gene encoding calmodulin-binding protein [75], was mapped on the QRn5 locus. Enrichment of LTP1 transcripts in RT reveals its signal transduction role in rhizome development. These genes may be candidates for further function identification.<br />Comparative analysis indicated that 12 rhizome-specific expressed genes on the rhizome-related QTL intervals of O. longistaminata were aligned with similar genes in the sorghum genome, suggesting that functional conserved candidate genes across taxa could account for rhizome growth and development. With the accomplishment of sorghum genome sequencing [76], further comparative genomics study is necessary for dissecting the molecular role of these rhizome-related QTL-associated candidate genes.<br />Conclusion A whole rice genome oligonucleotide microarray was used to profile gene expression across five tissues of the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata. Results showed<br /><br />that a very complex gene regulatory network underlies rhizome development and growth, and there might be an overlapping regulatory mechanism in the establishment of rhizomes and tillers. Phytohormones such as IAA and GA are involved in the signaling pathway in determining rhizomes. Several cis-elements enriched in rhizome and the identified rhizome-specific genes colocalized on the rhizome-related QTL intervals provide a base for further dissection of the molecular regulatory mechanism of the rhizomatous trait in rice.<br />Methods<br />Plant materials and RNA sampling The material used in this study was an unnamed wild rice accession of O. longistaminata originally collected from Niger [10]. It has long and strong rhizomes and has been maintained as a single plant in the greenhouse of the Food Crops Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China, since it was provided by Dr. Hyakutake, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Japan in 1999.<br />At the active tillering stage, five tissues of the O. longistaminata plant, including the rhizome tips (distal 1 cm of the young rhizomes), rhizome internodes, shoot tips (distal 5 mm of the tiller after removing all leaves), shoot internodes and young leaves were collected for total RNA extraction. Three independent biological replicates for each type of tissues were sampled, and all collected samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in a -70∞C freezer. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then purified and concentrated using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen).<br />Microarray hybridization and data analyses All microarray experiments were performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array (Santa Clara, CA). The array contains 51,279 probe sets representing 48,564 japonica and 1,260 indica transcripts. Preparation of cDNA, cRNA, hybridization to the array and quality control checks were carried out by a specialized biotech company, CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China. Briefly, the biotin-labeled fragmented cRNA was hybridized to the array for 16 hours using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then GeneChips were washed using Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using Gene Chip Scanner 3000. The Affymetrix GCOS software (version 1.4) was used to determine the total number of informative probe sets. The scanned images were firstly examined by visual inspection, and then processed to generate raw data saved as CEL files using the default setting of GCOS1.4. The normalization of all arrays was performed in a global scaling procedure by the dChip software. In the comparison analyses, a<br /><br />Hu et al.

The whole set of original microarray data has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and can be freely accessed through GEO Series number GSE24228.<br />Tissue-enriched genes were identified by the following procedures: The microarray data were subjected to preliminary screening with a selection threshold of false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5% using a multiclass method in the SAM software. The resultant data then were further screened when the expression value of a tissue showed more than 1.5-fold change compared with other tissues using a significance level at 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05) in Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests. Differentially expressed genes between RT and ST were determined using the two-class unpaired method in the SAM software with more than two-fold change and a q value less than 0.05.<br />Functional classification and prediction of cis-acting regulatory elements for the tissue-specific genes The putative function of each tissue-specific gene corresponding to the probe set on the chip was predicted by the Affymetrix annotation combined with the TIGR definition and NCBI database. The 1 kb sequences upstream of the differentially expressed genes were downloaded from the TIGR rice genome database and used for predicting the cis-acting regulatory elements. The cis-element data was obtained from PLACE http://www.dna.go.jp/ PLACE. The regulatory software developed by CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing) was used to perform the analysis of the enriched cis-regulatory elements for five different tissue-enriched genes sets and differentially regulated genes in RT. The confidence limit for a binomial proportion (P = 95%) was used to evaluate differences between identified cis-acting regulatory elements of the tissues.<br />Physical mapping and alignment of the rhizome-specific expressed genes with genetically mapped rhizomerelated QTLs Physical mapping of the rhizome-specific expressed genes was performed by aligning each of the rhizome-related QTLs previously identified in the RD23-O. Longistaminata F2 population with the physical locations of the rhizomespecific expressed genes obtained from TIGR japonica rice assembly based on the chromosomal locations of the SSR markers flanking the rhizome-related QTLs [11].<br />Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for confirmation of tissuespecific gene expression A set of tissue-specific expressed genes identified from the microarray analysis were selected for confirmation using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The gene sequences of the selected<br /><br />genes were obtained from NCBI database and the exon sequences from each gene were used for designing the primers with Primer 3 software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/. The resulting primers sequences are listed in Additional file 10. RT-PCR was performed using the same RNA samples used for the microarray experiments. Again, three biological replicates for each sample were used. The first-strand cDNA was obtained from 1 g of total RNA in a 50 l reaction mixture, and 1 l of synthesized cDNA was used as template for the PCR reaction (94∞C for 2 min; then 26 cycles of 30 s at 94∞C, 30 s at 52∞C, 30 s at 72∞C; followed at 72∞C for 2 min). The reaction products were sized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.<br />Additional material<br />Additional file 1: Commonly and uniquely expressed genes in the five tissues of O. longistaminata detected by the Affymetrix oligomer chips.

The large number of abundant of novel ESTs suggests different metabolic activity in O. longistaminata roots in comparison to O. sativa roots.<br /><br />Background Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food crop for about half of the world’s population. In 2008, the total riceharvested area and rough rice yield in the world were 155.7 million hectares and 661.8 million tons, respectively [International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) 2009]. However, the productivity of rice is severely affected by soil nitrogen nutrient deficiency worldwide. Commercially available urea fertilizer is the most widely used resource to meet a rice crop’s nitrogen requirement, of which one third is lost through emission of greenhouse gasses and leaching, causing adverse environmental impacts [1-3]. To meet these challenges and<br />* Correspondence: breinhold@uni-bremen.de † Contributed equally Laboratory of General Microbiology, Faculty of Biology and Chemistry, University of Bremen, PO.

These species are categorized into 10 recognizable genome types (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF, GG, BBCC, CCDD, HHJJ and HHKK) [9,10]. Wild rice has diversified over 40 million years. Wild species are tremendous gene reservoirs for domesticated rice improvement, as they possess many desirable traits, such as resistance to diseases and insect pests or tolerance to different kinds of stresses [11-14]. Oryza longistaminata chev. (2 n = 24, AA), broadly distributed throughout tropical Africa, is a perennial species with characteristics of long anthers, self-incompatibility, allogamy, strong<br /><br />© 2010 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In spite of its overall inferior appearance, O. longistaminata has furnished genes for developing perennial rice [15,16] and for breeding blight disease resistance varieties [17]. To make better use of this potential, more genomic information is required, but there are only few batches of mRNAs or full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) of O. longistaminata in public databases, and no genome sequence is available.<br />Sequencing and analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) has become a primary strategy for functional genomic studies in plants including novel gene discovery, gene expression profiling, microarray and molecular marker development, and accurate genome annotation. After completing the full genome sequence of O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare and the draft genome sequence of the O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11 through a map-based sequencing strategy and through a wholegenome shotgun sequencing approach, respectively [18,19], much efforts were involved into rice ESTs projects. Approximately 1249,110 ESTs and &gt;50,000 fulllength cDNA sequences of cultivated rice are currently available in public databases. However, the genomic studies of rice wild relatives are still in their infancy with the exception of the generation of 5,211 leaf ESTs from the O. minuta (BBCC genome) and 1,888 leaf FLcDNAs from the O. rufipogon (AA genome) [20,21]. Especially roots are organs underrepresented in EST studies.<br />Therefore, a comprehensive survey of ESTs in roots of O. longistaminata was undertaken to provide an overview of O. longistaminata root transcriptome and thus a molecular basis for the identification of useful genes. As newly developed massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing allows rapid generation of sequence data and deep sequencing coverage with reducing labour and cost [22-24], we here characterized the first global root transcriptome of that wild rice species O. longistaminata by 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology. This led to the discovery of a huge amount of novel ESTs which will facilitate gene mining and provide a basis for comparative studies within the genus Oryza.<br />Results and Discussion<br />Sequencing and assembly of 454 pyrosequencing ESTs In order to obtain transcripts of genes that might be required for growth under nutrient stress, O. longistaminata plants were clonally propagated and were adapted to low-nitrogen conditions in unfertilized soil for several months. Mature plants with high biomass production (see Additional file 1) were subjected to RNA extraction from roots. As soil-grown roots often yield low quality RNA with inhibitory effects on enzyme activity (reverse transcription or PCR) [25], several RNA extraction methods were compared. A standard extraction protocol<br /><br />with Trizol yielded degraded RNA (not shown), while RNA extracted by a CTAB-based method was of high quality (Additional file 1).<br />Pooled RNA extracts from two extractions were used for normalization and sequencing of cDNAs. One GSFLX 454 pyrosequencing run produced a total of 337,830 reads (87.3 Mb) with average sequence length of 258 bp (SD = 24, range = 60-925) from root cDNAs of O. longistaminata. After removal of adaptor sequences, polyA tail and low quality sequences, 337,471 reads remained with a total length of 66.7 Mb and an average length of 197 ± 61 bases, ranging from 20 bp to 393 bp (Additional file 2). Only sequences above 100 bp of length were further considered. Clustering and assembling of these sequences produced 43,423 contigs and 32,708 singletons. These data were trimmed again by removing those showing homology (E-value cutoff, e-5) to sequences of bacteria, fungi or metazoa, resulting in a total of 71,367 processed unique sequences. The length of contigs varied from 101 bp to 2082 bp with an average of 299 bp, and that of singlets ranged from 101 bp to 393 bp with an average of 215 bp (Additional file 2).<br />The majority of reads was in length of 201-300 bp (95% out of raw reads), which was consistent with the 454 GS-FLX sequencing capacity. The size distribution of O. longistaminata consensuses after assembly was shown in Table 1, revealing that 92% of them fell between 100 and 500 bp in length. Although none of singlets was longer than 500 bp in the whole EST dataset, there were 3,277 contigs with sequence length larger than 500 bp (Table 1). In addition, 21,762 contigs (53%) were still less than 250 bp. This might be due to the short length of the sequencing read and/or the low coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset. Most of the contigs were derived from few reads. 11,949 (29% out of contigs) and 7,226 (17.5% out of contigs) consensuses were derived from 2 and 3 reads, respectively (Additional file 3).<br /><br />Table 1 Size distribution of Oryza longistaminata ESTs after assembly<br /><br />Contigs<br /><br />Singletons Total<br /><br />101-250<br /><br />21762 (53%) 26977 (89%) 48739 (68%)<br /><br />251-500<br /><br />16150 (39%) 3201 (11%) 19351 (27%)<br /><br />501-750<br /><br />2663 (6%)<br /><br />2663 (4%)<br /><br />751-1000<br /><br />468 (1%)<br /><br />468 (&lt; 1%)<br /><br />&gt; 1000 bp<br /><br />146 (&lt; 1%)<br /><br />146 (&lt; 1%)<br /><br />Total number<br /><br />41189 (100%) 30178 (100%) 71367 (100%)<br /><br />G+C<br /><br />42.7%<br /><br />41.7%<br /><br />42.3%<br /><br />Average length (bp) 299 215 263<br /><br />Maximum length (bp) 2082<br /><br />393<br /><br />Average reads<br /><br />6.4<br /><br />Yang et al.

The ESTs were aligned to genomic sequences of two O. sativa varieties, japonica - type Nipponbare http:// rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/ and indica -type 93-11 http:// rice.genomics.org.cn/rice/index2.jsp, by using the BLASTN program with an E-value cut-off of e-5. In total, 60,155 (84.3%) out of 71,367 sequence tags were anchored in rice genome. These sequences mapped on all the 12 rice chromosomes (Table 2) with almost equal distribution, chromosome 1, 2, 3 harbouring large amount of EST sites accounting for approximately 40% of a total of 60,155 EST sites. The distribution corresponds well to the size of the chromosomes, which highlights the close relationship between these two species. These anchored ESTs also had a relatively high sequence identity with O. sativa sequences ranging from 78% to 100%, with an average of 97%. The sequence identity distribution of 60,155 O. longistaminata ESTs is shown in Figure 1, revealing that 61% of them had a sequence similarity higher than 98%.<br /><br />Table 2 Distribution of the consensus sequences in rice genome<br /><br />Chromosomea japonica<br /><br />indica<br /><br />NO. of ESTs Percentage No. of ESTs Percentage<br /><br />1 (43.26 Mb) 8194 13.7 8022 13.4<br /><br />2 (35.93 Mb) 7114 11.9 7121 11.9<br /><br />3 (36.41 Mb) 7773 13.0 7714 12.9<br /><br />4 (35.28 Mb) 4959<br /><br />8.3<br /><br />4915 8.2<br /><br />5 (29.89 Mb) 4867<br /><br />8.2<br /><br />4891 8.2<br /><br />6 (31.25 Mb) 4947<br /><br />8.3<br /><br />4827 8.1<br /><br />7 (29.70 Mb) 4486<br /><br />7.5<br /><br />4300 7.2<br /><br />8 (28.44 Mb) 4248<br /><br />7.1<br /><br />3901 6.5<br /><br />9 (23.01 Mb) 3186<br /><br />5.3<br /><br />2989 5.0<br /><br />10 (23.13 Mb) 3136<br /><br />5.3<br /><br />2879 4.8<br /><br />11 (28.51 Mb) 3250<br /><br />5.4<br /><br />2539 4.3<br /><br />12 (27.50 Mb) 3487 Unknownb<br /><br />5.8<br /><br />2934 4.9 2684 4.5<br /><br />Total<br /><br />59647<br /><br />100<br /><br />59716<br /><br />100<br /><br />aThe length of 12 Nipponbare (japonica cv.) chromosomes is indicated. b Genes not assembled into chromosomes of cv. 93-11.<br /><br />Figure 1 Similarity distribution (percent of DNA identity) of O. longistaminata ESTs showing homology with cultivated rice.<br />Among 60,155 ESTs, 508 could only be aligned to indica genome sequences and 439 could specifically match japonica genome sequences (see Additional file 4).

The latter assumption may be likely for part of these ESTs, as 74 out of the 164 indica-specific genes mapped to ESTs detected in japonica with highest score, and 22 out of 247 japonica-specific ones to indica ESTs. One of the 508 ESTs, Xa21_1574, was selected for further analysis. The Southern blot analysis was consistent with the BLAST results (Figure 2). Our findings indicated that O. longistaminata had parallel similarity to japonica and to indica rice at the DNA level. In order to assess how many O. longistaminata ESTs had already been detected as expressed genes in O. sativa, the ESTs mapping onto the O. sativa genomes were also compared with the Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopedia (KOME, http:// cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA/) cDNA collection, the indica cDNA database http://www.ncgr.ac.cn/ricd/, and the NCBI rice EST database. 83.3% matched to O. sativa genes found to be expressed previously.<br />A large amount of ESTs (9,993 or 16.7%) had previously not been detected as expressed. For most of them, we did not find homologies to predicted gene models: Inspection of the 30 longest ESTs showed that 67% shared sequence similarity with O. sativa but not to predicted genes, 23% with genes of predicted functions, and 10% with genes encoding hypothetical proteins. This was also reflected in the lack of functional assignments (see below), as after in silico translation only for a<br /><br />Yang et al.

This emphasizes the power of the next generation sequencing approach to detect novel transcripts or even novel genes. As the O. sativa genome may still contain regions that are not fully annotated, our ESTs might indicate as yet unpredicted genes or UTRs that might be functional in O. sativa as well. On the other hand, O. longistaminata might express a special set of genes in comparison to O. sativa, due the particular conditions - being adapted to low availability of external nitrogen sources-, or due to the interspecies differences in expression.<br />As another category of novel ESTs, in total, 11,212 (15.7%) of 71,367 unique EST sequences could not be mapped to the O. sativa chromosomes by homology search against genomic sequences. Among them, 250 matched the publicly available O. sativa mRNAs or ESTs. The remaining 10,962 sequence tags showed no significant sequence identity (cut- off e-5) with any rice genomic or expressed sequences in public database. Among these, only a very small number (740) had a significant hit in NCBI non-redundant (NR) nucleotide database or ESTs database. The remaining 10,222 ESTs may therefore represent novel genetic material present in O. longistaminata and other root-residing eukaryotes.<br /><br />Functional classification of O. longistaminata ESTs The consensus sequences were annotated for sequence similarities using the BLASTX translated sequence comparison against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database. Among the 71,367 contigs and singlets, 34,510 (48.4%) had at least a significant alignment to exisiting gene models in the NR database at an E-value cut-off of e-5. A majority (51.6%) of the O. longistaminata sequences did not match any known protein sequences. Most of the 10,962 novel sequence tags (15.4%) fell into this category. This can partly be attributed to the short length of most of these uni-ESTs, or a large fraction of the ESTs might represent untranslated regions. Mapping those uni-ETSs to rice gene models supported this assumption. https://www.gabipd.org/database/cgi-bin/ GreenCards.pl.cgi.<br />The unique ESTs were further classified into Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Components, according to the standard Gene Ontology terms (GO; http://www.geneontology.org). Only to 25,448 O. longistaminata sequence tags GO numbers were assigned, however a broad range of GO categories was covered: the percentage distribution of GO terms is shown in Figure 3. A total of 20,935 sequences could be assigned to the Molecular Function. Among them, nucleotide binding (31.6%) and binding (general, including small molecules) (31.3%) and catalytic activity (21%) were the most dominant categories. With regard to the category of Biological Process containing 16,036 ESTs, cellular processes (24%) were the most highly represented category. The following categories were protein modification processes (18.9%), metabolic processes (17%), transport (15.9%) and biosynthetic processes (12.5%). Under the category of Cellular Component, 31.9% of 13,492 ESTs were predicted as membrane proteins (general category including different organelles), followed by plastid (16.2%), nucleus (15.8%) and plasma membrane (15.3%) proteins.<br />Biological Validation of Novel ESTs Approximately 15.4% of the unique EST sequences detected in the O. longistaminata root transcriptome currently are not similar to rice sequences in databases. These may represent novel genes of O. longistaminata not present in O. sativa, or it may be possible that there are gaps existing in cultivated rice genome sequences, or a small portion of the unmapped sequences might have resulted from contamination by non-rice sources. A total of 14 novel ESTs were randomly selected for RTPCR to determine the portion of potential novel genes originating from O. longistaminata rather other organisms in our transcript collection. RT-PCR experiments were conducted on RNAs derived from root tissue of clonally propagated O. longistaminata plants grown in<br /><br />Yang et al.

Of the 13 primer pairs for PCR, 10 generated RT-PCR products that were of the expected size and whose sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The results demonstrated that these 10 novel transcripts detected among the 454-ESTs are indeed expressed in O. longistaminata roots grown in soil (Figure 2A). Among another set of primer pairs for 19 additional ESTs, six yielded a positive result (Additional file 5). However, as conditions for PCR amplification cannot be optimized due to lack of intron-free template, these results may be an underestimation. To test for distribution of the putatively expressed genes among different accessions of the same species, O. longistaminata grains collected at the Okavango region of Namibia were used for gnotobiotic cultivation of seedlings in the phytotron, and pooled for analysis. From root RNA extracts, 5 of the 10 primer pairs yielded RTPCR products with correct size whose sequences were validated by Sanger sequencing again. This confirmed that these fragments indeed originated from this species and not e.g. from root endophytes, and that their expression was conserved within the species. To control occurrence in the genome, Southern blot analysis was carried out from genomic DNA extracted from leaves of O. longistaminata accession IRGC 110404, and from O. sativa. Probes generated from two out of the 10 ESTs detected hybridizing fragments for wild but not for cultivated rice (Figure 2B). The results indicated that these 2 ESTs are indeed O. longistaminata-specific sequences. Based on these results, we estimated that a large subset of novel sequences was derived from O. longistaminata. The remaining novel EST sequences might be due to the contamination from other sources or due to the 454 sequencing artefacts.<br /><br />adaptation to nutrient-limiting conditions. All EST obtained in this study is attached in the supplemental data (Additional file 6).<br />Methods<br />Plant materials The O. longistaminata accession IRGC 110404 (short name Xa21) was grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions in soil without nitrogen fertilizer in the phytotron in Bremen. The soil (from Camargue) had a low percentage of total nitrogen (0,229%) and a high C/N ratio (25.5). The roots and leaves were harvested by snapfreezing in liquid nitrogen and prepared for RNA and DNA isolation, respectively. The seeds of O. longistaminata collected from Namibia were surface-sterilized [28] and cultured gnotobiotically in plant medium [29] supplemented with agar (4 g per L).<br />RNA and DNA extraction, cDNA synthesis The RNA was extracted by the CTAB method described by Chang et al. [30] from soil-grown roots and then purified using plant RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden). The RNA from cultured seeds was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of RNA was evaluated by a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Genomic DNA was isolated by the CTAB method described by Allen et al. [31] from leaves. The concentration of DNA was determined spectrophotometrically and the quality of DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). cDNA was purified by QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden).<br /><br />Conclusions In this study, we present a large-scale EST dataset comprising 71,367 unique EST sequences derived from wild rice O. longistaminata by massively parallel pyrosequencing. Among them, 34,510 ESTs matched to known gene models, and 25,448 ESTs were annotated with GO terms. The comparative analysis between wild rice and two domesticated rice subspecies indicated that O. longistaminata had parallel similarity to japonica as to indica rice. Notably, a large amount of ESTs derived from O. longistaminata roots have not yet been detected as expressed in O. sativa, or did not show similarity to publicly available rice sequences or any other genes. Our data contribute to future annotation approaches of the O. longistaminata genome, to identification of O. longistaminata-specific genes and to the comparative study of the evolution among Oryza genus. These novel ESTs will particularly provide a basis for further identification of genes of O. longistaminata underlying<br /><br />454 pyrosequencing, assembly and annotation Synthesis of cDNA and normalization for pyrosequencing was carried out by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) using RNA from roots of soil-grown plants without Nfertilizer. High quality polyA+ RNA was isolated from total RNA as template for first- and second-strand synthesis. By using a semirandom priming approach for both strands, an even shotgun-like distribution of cDNA fragments was achieved. The fragments were size-fractionated and normalised by denaturing and reassociation. Approximately 10 μg of cDNAs were sheared by nebulisation and sequenced on a 454 GSFLX pyrosequencing platform. A total of 337,830 raw reads were obtained. SeqClean software http://compbio. dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/ was applied to eliminate low quality sequences, poly A/T sequences, adaptor sequences. The cleaned sequences were subjected to the CAP3 program [32] for clustering and assembly with default parameters. All the consensus sequences were<br /><br />Yang et al.

GO accessions were obtained via assignment of Arabidopsis gene identifiers with the strongest BLASTx alignments to the corresponding O. longistaminata ESTs. Comparison of the distribution of cellular component, biological processes or molecular function obtained using GO annotation was done using the GOSlim program http://www. geneontology.org.<br />The sequences are available at http://www.gabipd.org/ under the accession Xa21_454, and at GenBank (dbEST acc. No. HS317469 - HS388835).<br />RT-PCR and Southern blot analyses To validate the presence of novel ESTs detected by pyrosequencing in O. longistaminata, randomly selected sequences were used for expression analysis by RT-PCR (root RNA) and Southern blot (leaf DNA) analyses. About 100 ng total RNA was use to synthesize the firststrand cDNA by SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with Oligo(dT)12-18 primers. Specific primer pairs for cDNA amplification were designed by Primer3 software [33] according to the EST sequences. PCR was performed in a 50 μL reaction volume containing 1 μL cDNA, 1× PCR buffer [10 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2], 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, and 1.5 U Taq polymerase (MolTaq). The annealing temperature was 60°C for all primer pairs. After 5 min at 94°C, 35 cycles were carried out with 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C for extension and final step of 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were purified and sequenced by the Sanger method (LGC Genomics, Germany). For Southern blot analysis, 5 μg of genomic DNA was used for restriction endonuclease digestion with HindIII and subjected to Southern blot analysis with digoxygenin-labeled probes according to the protocol described by Neuhaus-Url et al. [34].<br />Additional material<br />Additional file 1: Source of O. longistaminata root ESTs.<br />Additional file 2: Characterization of O. longistaminata ESTs before and after assembly.<br />Additional file 3: Summary of component reads per assembly.<br />Additional file 4: Consensus sequences specifically matched to indica or japonica genome sequences.<br />Additional file 5: O. longistaminata ESTs analyzed by RT-PCR from cDNA of pot-grown O. longistaminata rice roots.<br />Additional file 6: Assembled pyrosequencing ESTs.

Because most annual crops have less extensive, shorter-lived root systems than do perennial species, with a correspondingly lower capacity to manage nutrients and water, annual cropping systems tend to suffer higher levels of soil erosion and generate greater water contamination than do perennial systems. In an effort to reduce soil degradation and water contamination simultaneously – something that neither no-till nor organic cropping alone can accomplish – researchers in the United States, Australia and other countries have begun breeding perennial counterparts of annual grain and legume crops. Initial cycles of hybridization, propagation and selection in wheat, wheatgrasses, sorghum, sunﬂower and Illinois bundleﬂower have produced perennial progenies with phenotypes intermediate between wild and cultivated species, along with improved grain production. Further breeding cycles will be required to develop agronomically adapted perennial crops with high grain yields.<br />Additional keywords: plant breeding, sorghum, sunﬂower, sustainable agriculture, wheat.<br /><br />Introduction<br />Before the introduction of agriculture, almost all of the world’s landscapes were covered primarily by perennial plants growing in mixed stands; today, the bulk of global cropland is sown to monocultures of annual crops. The transformation is accelerating, with more land worldwide having been converted from perennial to annual cover since 1950 than in the previous 150 years (Chiras and Reganold 2004). As the area occupied by annual species continues to expand, the threat of soil degradation looms larger. In a ﬁeld experiment encompassing 100 years of data collection, annual crops were 50 times more susceptible to soil erosion than were perennial pasture crops (Gantzer et al. 1990).<br />‘No-till’ cropping, a method of curbing soil erosion using annual grain crops, reduces soil loss but requires chemical inputs for control of weeds and other pests. As it improves the soil permeability of previously tilled land, no-till cropping of annual species decreases nutrient runoff, but it does not address the increasingly serious problem of nutrients and water leaching from annual crop ﬁelds into groundwater and eventually into rivers and seas (Randall and Mulla 2001; Tilman et al. 2001). Nitrogen losses from annual crops may be 30 to 50 times higher than those from perennial crops (Randall and Mulla 2001). Organic farming of annual crops addresses the problem of pesticide contamination but not the physical erosion of soil. And organic systems do not compensate for the relative inefﬁciency of annual species in capturing water and nutrients.<br />Diverse, perennial grain-cropping systems have been proposed as a means of protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon below ground, and building better pest tolerance (Glover et al. 2007). However, before such systems can be deployed and tested, new,<br />Ó CSIRO 2010<br /><br />perennial cereal, grain legume, and/or oilseed crops must be developed through breeding (Cox et al. 2002, 2006).<br />One of the globe’s most striking impacts of annual cropping has been the emergence of soil salinisation in parts of Australia. Citing a survey of lucerne research by Ward et al. (2006), Bell et al. (2008) projected that escape of rainwater below the root zone (which can lead to rising water tables and salinisation) could be reduced 90% by replacing annual wheat with perennial wheat. Bell et al. (2008) concluded that ‘perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a proﬁtable option for mixed crop/livestock producers’ while helping prevent salt build-up in the soil.<br />The Land Institute in the United States, Australia’s Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research Centre, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China, and other research groups are conducting or initiating breeding programs in intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth &amp; D. R. Dewey], perennial wheat (Triticum spp./ Thinopyrum spp.), perennial sorghum [Sorghum bicolour (L.) Moench/S. halepense (L.) Pers.], Maximilian sunﬂower (Helianthus maximiliani Schrad.), perennial sunﬂower (complex hybrids of Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleﬂower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michaux) MacMillan), and perennial rice (hybrids of Oryza spp.) This paper summarises some of the results obtained so far at The Land Institute from two breeding approaches: direct domestication of wild perennial species, and hybridisation between annual crops and related perennial species followed by selection.<br />Materials and methods<br />All hybridisation, propagation, and experimental activities described below were conducted between 2002 and 2008,<br />10.1071/CP09201 1836-0947/10/070513<br /><br />514 Crop &amp; Pasture Science<br /><br />T. S. Cox et al.<br /><br />inclusive, on The Land Institute’s research farm and in its glasshouses in Saline County, KS. Soil types on the research farm include Hord silt loam (ﬁne-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls) and Cozad silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls). The location is 370 m above sea level on the western fringe of the tallgrass prairie region, near the geographical centre of the continental United States. Mean annual precipitation in the area is 737 mm, with an average of approximately one-tenth of that precipitation coming in the form of snow. Rainfall is concentrated in spring and fall, and extended droughts are common in summer. The mean daily high temperature in July is 348C, the mean nightly low in January is –78C, and rapid, wide swings in temperature are common in all seasons. Leading crops in the region are hard winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), grain sorghum, maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Winter-killing of wheat is not common but can occur. Chief stresses for winter wheat in the area are created by a variety of pathogens and by heat during reproductive growth; for the warm-season crops, summer drought is the most common stress. In experimental perennial crops, additional stresses include late spring heat for wheat, prolonged periods of sub-freezing soil temperatures for sorghum and sunﬂower, and feeding by a range of insects in sunﬂower.<br />Intermediate wheatgrass<br />An intermediate wheatgrass population was developed by intermating germplasm from a wide range of sources, including a population acquired from an earlier selection program conducted by the Rodale Institute and US Department of Agriculture (Wagoner 1995). Each of 1000 plants was divided into 3 clonal replicates, and the population was evaluated in a randomised complete-block design in 2003–05. Plants were transplanted into a 92 cm grid pattern. Plant height, grain yield per stem, and 1000-kernel weight were determined for all plants in the second summer of growth. A selection index was constructed, giving equal weight to yield per stem and kernel weight. Based on this index, the four plants with the highest values for the index, plus a ﬁfth, extremely short plant, were intermated in isolation to establish the ‘I5C1’ population. Additionally, 50 plants (including the 5 I5C1 parents) were intermated to establish the ‘I50C1’ population. A total of 4000 plants from the two populations were evaluated as unreplicated spaced plants in 2005–08. The same traits were evaluated as in the ﬁrst cycle, again in the second summer of growth. The proportion of kernels threshing free of hulls was estimated for each plant, and the yield and kernel-weight values were adjusted to estimate these values on a naked-kernel basis.<br />Perennial wheat<br />Among hundreds of hybrids produced between wheat and perennial grasses since 2002, was a hybrid between a tetraploid, carthlicum-type wheat (T. turgidum L.) accession PI 573182 and a Th. intermedium plant derived from a population that had undergone two cycles of selection for seed yield and grain quality. The male-sterile F1 hybrid was pollinated with another Th. intermedium plant. Although several F1 plants were obtained from that cross, only 2 produced selfed seed. The F2 seeds from one F1 individual were grown in the glasshouse, and root tips and slides were prepared for genomic in situ hybridisation<br /><br />(GISH) analysis. Methods of DNA extraction, labelling, and hybridization were carried out as described by Zhang et al. (2001). Total genomic DNA extracted from Th. intermedium was used as probe. T. aestivum DNA was used as the competitor to block non-speciﬁc DNA hybridization with the probe.<br />Perennial sorghum<br />Perennial sorghum populations were initiated by fertilizing diploid (2n = 20) sorghum plants with pollen from tetraploid, perennial plants (2n = 40). Diploid parents included the genetic male-sterile inbred line N216 and the cytoplasmic-genetic male-sterile inbred lines ATx2921, ATx2925, ATx2926, and ATx2928. Tetraploid parents were obtained from an anonymous bulk population of perennial plants ﬁrst created in the early 1980s at The Land Institute by hybridizing induced tetraploid sorghum plants with unidentiﬁed accessions of S. halepense (Piper and Kulakow 1994). The male sterile diploid parents, when pollinated by tetraploid plants, produced very small numbers of viable seed: approximately one seed per pollinated panicle, an outcome consistent with Hadley (1958). All hybrids thus produced were tetraploid. Out of ~20 000 F3 plants harvested in 2005, ~300 survived the winter and emerged in spring 2006. The surviving plants were descended from 28 diploid/tetraploid parental combinations; the number of plants descended from any one parental combination ranged from 1 to 37. Of the surviving plants, 38 plants representing 16 parental combinations were selected on the basis of phenotype, and 38 F3derived families derived from those plants via self-pollination were entered in a ﬁeld experiment along with two cultivated checks (BTx2921 and a commercial hybrid, ‘Phillips 664’) in 2007. The experiment was sown in a randomised complete-block design with 4 replicates. The experimental unit (plot) was a single row 3 m long bordered by single rows of ‘Phillips 664’ on both sides. Spacing between rows was 92 cm. Each plot was assigned an agronomic index incorporating equally weighted, visual ratings of plant height, plant form, and panicle compactness. The range of the index was 0 to 9, with 9 assigned to the grain sorghum parent. Harvested grain was de-hulled and dried to uniform moisture before weighing. In April and May, 2008, re-emergence from rhizomes was scored in the experiment described above as well as in two sets of smaller, replicated, randomised plots located 2 km from the main plots. Observations of the proportion of plants surviving the winter in all ﬁeld plots were combined into a single, unitless winter-hardiness index, ranging from 0 to 9, that was associated with each family. Families were allocated between two groups: ‘most winter-hardy’, which contained 13 families with winter-hardiness indices of 5 or greater, and ‘other’, which contained 25 families with indices below 5. Signiﬁcance of differences between the two groups for traits other than winter-hardiness was tested via analysis of variance based on a generalized linear model using GENSTAT, Release 11.1 (VSN International Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Spearman rank correlation was used to test for signiﬁcance of association between traits.<br />Perennial sunﬂower<br />Crowns from 300 wild H. maximiliani plants grown from seeds collected across Kansas were divided and transplanted in a selection experiment with six clonal replicates of each plant.<br /><br />Progress in breeding perennial grains<br /><br />Crop &amp; Pasture Science 515<br /><br />An index including second-year estimates of shattering resistance, seed size, and stalk yield was used to rank the plants. The 20 plants with highest index values were transplanted into an intermating nursery in 2006. One hundred and twelve progeny seedlings from each of the 20 intermated parents were transplanted to the ﬁeld in a 92 cm grid pattern in spring 2007. At maturity, but before shattering could occur, ﬁve heads were harvested from each plant and dried. The heads were placed in a gentle electric mixer for 1 min to encourage shattering, and the seed was weighed. Those seeds remaining in the heads were threshed manually or using a more aggressive electric mixer and weighed. In 2008, head samples were placed in a plastic jar and the jars tumbled in an electric concrete mixer for 3 min to encourage shattering. (Domestic sunﬂower heads would not have ﬁt in the jars used and were not used as checks.) The number and diameter of stalks was recorded. After heads remaining in the ﬁeld had been exposed to killing frosts, heads from each plant were examined and visual estimates of the percent seed lost through shattering were made. GENSTAT REML-based spatial analysis software was used to account for spatial variation and obtain adjusted values for each plant. Several subsets of the full spatial model for each trait were compared. Model selection followed the criteria described in the GENSTAT user guide. Adjusted values are reported.<br />Results<br />At The Land Institute, we are working towards direct domestication of three perennial species: intermediate wheatgrass, Illinois bundleﬂower, and Maximilian sunﬂower. This work does not involve interspeciﬁc hybridisation. We have used cycles of interspeciﬁc hybridisation and selection as well, in efforts to develop three other perennial crops: wheat, sorghum, and sunﬂower.<br />Intermediate wheatgrass and perennial wheat<br />Intermediate wheatgrass is an allogamous, perennial relative of wheat. Both species are allohexaploids with 2n = 42, and share no homologous genome. We are domesticating intermediate wheatgrass by selecting for increased grain yield and larger, free-threshing kernels. The evaluation phase of a second cycle of population improvement was completed in 2008. Each of the 4000 plants in the selection nursery was identiﬁed as having been produced by intermating either the top 5 selected plants (I5C1) or top 50 selected plants (I50C1) from the ﬁrst cycle. The two subpopulations, which resulted from ﬁrst-cycle selection intensities of 0.5% and 5.0%, respectively, both displayed signiﬁcant positive skewness for the traits on which selection had been based in the ﬁrst cycle: yield per head and kernel weight. All of the traits used in selecting the parents of the I5C1 population (yield per head, kernel weight, and reduced height) had substantially larger values for kurtosis and skewness (always in the direction of selection) than did the I50C1 population (Fig. 1; Table 1). If selection is having an impact on these statistics, the effect would be larger in populations undergoing higher selection intensity, and that is what occurred. Traits not subjected to selection, including fraction of naked kernels and yield per plant, had skewness and kurtosis in I5C1 equal to or lower than those in I50C1 (Table 1).<br /><br />The most dramatic result of selection was an increasing frequency of short, stiff-strawed genotypes with erect leaves and large spikes. Some of those plants, along with others in the long positive tails of the skewed distributions for traits under selection, had very high values. Some 1000-kernel weights were 8 g and higher, compared with a population median less than 4.4 g. Yields per 100 spikes of the top 10 plants ranged from 41 to 320 g, compared with a median of 6 g. The planting arrangements of the selection experiments were not appropriate for estimating yield per unit land area.<br />Thinopyrum species can be hybridised with tetraploid and hexaploid wheat plants, with the objective of developing perennial, wheat-like plants. Chromosome doubling in the high-ploidy hybrids is extremely difﬁcult, so few amphiploids have been made. Our backcrosses to the annual parent have produced thousands of plants with good fertility and kernel size. In the glasshouse, a large proportion of such plants continue to live after their mature seed has been harvested, but in The Land Institute’s ﬁeld plots, a very small minority of plants re-grow after summer harvest, and they invariably die in late summer.<br />To obtain larger numbers of perennial plants, we have crossed interspeciﬁc hybrid plants to Thinopyrum plants. Out of hundreds of such species-backcross hybrids, many were sterile, as expected. Crossing male-sterile hybrid plants with the few male-fertile plants produced a population of ~1100 progeny, almost all of which displayed some degree of fertility along with improved kernel size and re-growth capacity. F2 plants descended from a plant designated ‘B930’ (T. turgidum/ Th. intermedium//Th. intermedium), for example, have a phenotype intermediate between the annual and perennial parent and strong re-growth in the glasshouse (Fig. 2a, b). Fertility is low, with fewer than 5 kernels per spike, and kernels are intermediate in weight between those of the annual and perennial parents. Among 3 plants in family B930, chromosome numbers were 57, 59, and 60. Based on ﬂuorescence patterns in GISH images (Fig. 2c), the genomes of two plants from B930 carried 42 chromosomes from Th. intermedium – the normal number for pure Th. intermedium plants – and 17 to 18 wheat chromosomes. Plant B930-36 had 43 Th. intermedium and 14 wheat chromosomes. The complete genome of Th. intermedium and varying portions of the wheat genome appear to be carried by these 3 plants. No spontaneous interspeciﬁc translocations were detected in these plants. We ﬁnd such translocations only rarely; therefore, we cannot rely on them to separate known beneﬁcial and deleterious genes that might be located on the same chromosome in the interspeciﬁc lines. To effect recombination between, for example, a gene conferring perenniality and genes found on the same Thinopyrum chromosome that confer undesirable traits, tools such as the ph alleles that permit non-homologous pairing must be used (Gill et al. 2006).<br />Perennial grain sorghum<br />The Land Institute’s perennial sorghum breeding program, initiated in 2001 with rhizomatous tetraploid germplasm originally developed in the 1980s, has focused on improving winter survival of rhizomes and reducing height and tillering<br /><br />516 Crop &amp; Pasture Science<br /><br />T.

The 14 dark chromosomes are inherited from the wheat parent, and the 43 light chromosomes are from Th. intermedium.<br /><br />while increasing kernel size. S. halepense overwinters in temperate regions through survival of rhizomes. Genetic control of rhizome production and growth is highly complex (Paterson et al. 1995); despite that, increasing the grain yield and kernel weight of rhizomatous plants has proceeded without apparent hindrance. However, the majority of rhizomatous plants are not winter-hardy in central Kansas.<br />In 2005–06 and 2006–07 yield trials, ~1.5% of an estimated 20 000 F3 and F4 plants derived from annual/perennial crosses,<br /><br />survived to re-emerge from rhizomes in spring. In smaller<br />observation plots 2 km distant from the yield trials, mean survival was 20%. Selfed seeds from the 38 least ‘wild’ plants that survived in 2005–06 were used to sow a 2007 yield trial. The mean yield across the 38 families was 60% of an inbred parental check’s yield and 36% of the yield of a locally adapted commercial grain sorghum, ‘Phillips 664’. Mean kernel size was 36% of the value of the grain sorghum entries, which<br />were similar to each other. Taken together, the results imply<br /><br />518 Crop &amp; Pasture Science<br /><br />T. S. Cox et al.<br /><br />that numbers of seeds produced per unit of area were similar between the experimental families and grain sorghum checks, although seed numbers were not determined directly. The onethird of families with winter-hardiness indices of 5 and above had 11% lower yields and 5% lower kernel weights than did less winter-hardy families with indices of 0 to 4 (Table 2). Differences between means of the two groups were highly signiﬁcant (P &lt; 0.01), as were differences between progeny and parent means.<br />Grain production in current perennial sorghum germplasm is clearly lower than in modern annual cultivars. However, the yields and kernel weights shown in Table 2 are higher than those of most other perennial plant species currently under development as perennial grains (Cox et al. 2006). Studies since 2003 have demonstrated no strong associations between rhizome development or winter-hardiness on one hand and agronomic traits on the other. Despite the mean differences between groups in Table 2, there were no signiﬁcant correlations between perenniality and productivity traits, with one exception: a weak rank correlation of –0.33 between the agronomic and winter-hardiness indices. Of the traits going into the agronomic index, the one having the strongest association with winter-hardiness was panicle compactness, with a rank correlation of –0.70 (P &lt; 0.01). Studies are underway to determine whether the association between these complex traits is a result of linkage or pleiotropy.<br />Perennial sunﬂower<br />Maximilian sunﬂower is a diploid perennial species (2n = 34) native to the central United States. We are domesticating it for use as an oilseed crop, via methods similar to those described above for intermediate wheatgrass. Seed production is low, but phenotypic variation is extensive. In addition to the usual production traits, selection goals include elimination of shattering and dormancy, along with a more determinate growth habit, with small seed-heads fused into larger, more highly clustered heads.<br />Data collected from a population of 2240 plants in 2007–08 were used to select parents for a third cycle of intermating and selection. Forty plants were selected based on an index in which trait values, standardised to mean 0 and standard deviation 1, are summed: yield per plant + yield per head + yield per stalk – height – mean shattering. With second-year plants averaging 2 m tall, height was selected against as an indirect way to reduce lodging<br /><br />and increase harvest index. Based on selection intensities, the selection index would be expected to move the population in the direction of greater seed productivity without improving other traits (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, rare individual plants in the population exhibited extreme trait expression for individual traits, including non-shattering, head clustering, stalk diameter, and single-seed size. In this work, we are domesticating a wild population in which no single plant would be rated acceptable for cultivation; therefore, it is not surprising that such plants, which warranted retention on the basis of superlative single-trait values, did not score high on more than one trait of interest (Fig. 3). For example, we identiﬁed three plants with shattering scores in the lowest 20% of all plants in one natural and two mechanical shattering tests. None of the low-shattering plants, including plant 1104 (Fig. 3), was superior for any other trait. (For the 2040 samples evaluated for shattering resistance by the concrete-mixer method, percent shattering ranged from 36 to 100%, with a mean of 89%. As a screen for outliers with reduced shattering, this method was the most useful of those used. However, resolution was sacriﬁced at the middle and upper ranges of the distribution. Researchers seeking more uniform resolution would need to use a less vigorous method.)<br />Plant 2108’s seed yield per stalk was 6 times the population mean. Although its yield per plant was only slightly above the mean, its lower stalk density may provide better adaptation to production conditions. Plant 273 was unusual in having unbranched stalks and a single head per stalk. Its yields per plant and stalk were very low; however, its heads were larger than those of any other plant in the population. Plant 2196’s 1000-seed weight was 5.3 g, compared with a population mean of 3.1 g, but it had lower-than-average yield per plant and higher-than-average shattering and height. We identiﬁed 3 plants with height in the bottom 2.5 percentile of the population, and compactness and stem diameter in the top 97.5 percentile – all desirable traits. One of them, plant 8, was among the top 20 plants for stalk diameter, and at 1.5 m, it was almost 0.5 m shorter than the population mean. Plants were not clonally replicated, so the effects of genotype, environment, and their interaction on that expression cannot be separated. However, plants falling far outside the usual range, and in a desired direction, were considered likely to produce useful progeny when used in plant-to-plant crosses.<br />The parallel route to perennial sunﬂower is through hybridisation. Domestic sunﬂower, a diploid, can be hybridised with several perennial species in its genus, including Maximilian sunﬂower and two hexaploids: rigid-leaf<br /><br />Table 2.

Desf.] and Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus L.). Hybrids between annual and Maximilian sunﬂower are highly sterile. The strategy we have followed in producing perennial, partially fertile plants involves crossing both annual and Maximilian sunﬂower to H. rigidus and H. tuberosus to produce tetraploid plants, which we then interpollinate. Large perennial populations thus produced are now undergoing selection for greater seed fertility. In 2007, 102 interspeciﬁc hybrid plants produced more than 100 seeds each, and 26 produced more than 500 each. Those are small seed numbers compared with the annual parent, but large compared with most such hybrids.<br />Illinois bundleﬂower<br />Bundleﬂower is a long-lived, widely adapted, native perennial. Plants produce unusually large seed for an herbaceous perennial species, and the seed has high protein concentration (Kulakow 1999). Current domestication efforts are focused on improving shattering resistance, synchronous maturity, seed yield, and seed size and quality. The germplasm base is a large collection of accessions from a wide geographical area (Kulakow 1999) that exhibits great allelic diversity (DeHaan et al. 2003). Making controlled hybrids is difﬁcult, but methods have been developed to foster natural hybridisation and identify hybrids using morphological or molecular markers. Almost all Illinois bundleﬂower plants have means of seed dispersal, which are<br /><br />essential to ﬁtness in the wild but make harvest difﬁcult. Rare nonshattering families have been selected and used as initial parents. In addition, plants whose pods open in order to shed seed are being hybridised with other, rarer plants whose pods abscise and fall to the soil intact. The goal is to select recombinants whose pods neither open nor abscise before harvest.<br />Discussion<br />DeHaan et al. (2005) predicted that artiﬁcial selection in a properly managed agricultural environment could increase seed yield while maintaining perenniality. The experience of forage breeders in improving seed production can suggest strategies and techniques for the direct domestication of species such as intermediate wheatgrass, Maximilian sunﬂower, and Illinois bundleﬂower; however, without the need to select for forage yield or quality, grain production may be increased more quickly than is seed production in forages. The process may be complicated by high degrees of skewness and kurtosis in distributions for traits under selection, as were apparent in intermediate wheatgrass. In the absence of gene interaction, kurtosis is expected to be near zero or negative (Choo and Reinbergs 1982); positive skewness has been associated with complementary epistasis (Pooni et al. 1977), and higher selection intensities are expected to be more effective when interaction is complementary.<br /><br />520 Crop &amp; Pasture Science<br /><br />T. S. Cox et al.<br /><br />Results to date from the intermediate wheatgrass selection program are consistent with the above predictions. Phenotypes of the top-ﬁve selected plants – parents of the I5C1 population – and segregation in their progeny were consistent with existence of major genes for seed size, short stature, reduced stem number, non-shattering, or increased yield per head. The differences could generally be identiﬁed qualitatively due to gross morphological differences. When only the 5 plants expressing those traits were intermated in isolation, there were a few outstanding plants appearing in the I5C1 population. The I5C1 parents made up only 10% of the parentage of the I50C1 population, so their majoreffect genes, if they exist, were seldom brought together in the same plants. These results suggest that traditional population improvement through cycles of selection and random mating may not be an effective method for domesticating a self-incompatible perennial species. Inbreeding, though more complex and difﬁcult in obligately allogamous species than in others, will be required to bring desired genes closer to ﬁxation. Similarly in Maximilian sunﬂower, plants such as number 273, with its hitherto unfamiliar growth form, and seed dispersal mutants in Maximilian sunﬂower and Illinois bundleﬂower, should be handled in biparental crosses or very small populations as well as in the large main population.<br />During domestication, selection for yield begins at a low starting point. Yields of dehulled intermediate wheatgrass grain produced in small, solid-seeded plots during 2006–08 have been in the range of 30 g/m2. Managed gene ﬂow from modern crop species can, in theory, introduce genes conferring higher yields as well as those important for domestication (DeHaan et al. 2005). However, the useful genes acquired through hybridisation do not come without a genetic cost. When most crops – including wheat, rice, barley, rye, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, soybean, and sunﬂower – are crossed with perennial relatives, differences in chromosome number, lack of chromosome homology, or other factors can cause moderate to complete sterility and restrict genetic recombination in the progeny (Cox et al. 2002). The plant breeder working with such crosses must struggle with genomic disruptions in addition to selecting to improve multiple traits simultaneously.<br />Loss of Thinopyrum chromosomes in early generations of progeny derived directly from hybrids and amphiploids between Triticum and Thinopyrum species typically produces plants with ~42 Triticum and 14 Thinopyrum chromosomes (Banks et al. 1993). Such plants do not function as perennials in the Kansas environments in which we have tested them; therefore, we are examining the results of backcrossing to the Thinopyrum parent. Such crosses have produced plants whose relative chromosomes numbers – 42 to 43 from Thinopyrum and 14 to 18 from Triticum (Fig. 2) – form a reverse image of what is typically obtained from progeny of amphiploids. We have generated other plants, not shown, that carry the entire Thinopyrum complement along with a single pair of wheat chromosomes. GISH cannot identify speciﬁc chromosomes, so we will employ other techniques such as C-banding and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to determine which speciﬁc wheat chromosomes are being retained in backcross plants. Determining chromosomal constitutions of key plants in such populations is important. Cox et al. (2002) predicted that perennial wheat breeders would need to subdivide their programs, assigning plants of similar chromosomal makeup to subpopulations within which<br /><br />hybridization would not lead to excessive aneuploidy and sterility. Furthermore, with further backcrossing, we hope to determine which individual pairs of wheat chromosomes might be added to wheatgrass to improve kernel weight or other traits.<br />In the taxa studied to date, plants derived from interspeciﬁc hybrids tend to be perennial only when the expected proportion of their total genome derived from a perennial parent is at least 50% (Cox et al. 2002). Therefore, one random backcross to the annual species tends to produce populations consisting largely of annual plants; with the autogamous species sorghum and rice at The Land Institute and at YAAS (Hu Fengyi, YAAS, pers. comm.; Sacks et al. 2003) respectively, we have found it most efﬁcient to self-pollinate interspeciﬁc hybrids one or more generations, select the most strongly perennial progenies, and only then backcross to annual parents. Perenniality in sorghum and rice is under complex genetic control (Paterson et al. 1995; Hu et al. 2003) and interacts strongly with the environment. Therefore, it will not be fully achieved through manipulation of individual genes. On the other hand, marker-assisted selection could help accelerate the simultaneous improvement of perenniality, fertility, and grain production in rice, sorghum, and other species (Paterson et al. 1995; Hu et al. 2003). The Land Institute’s sorghum program has chosen strong winter-hardiness as a breeding objective. But agronomically improved, rhizomatous plants with little or no winter-hardiness have been developed and maintained as breeding material for warm temperate or tropical environments. There, plants regrowing from rhizomes could have the potential for faster early growth and greater vigour than plants in a traditional ratoon crop re-growing from crowns.<br />The time scale needed to bring perennial grain crops to the farm will vary across species. Intermediate wheatgrass, for example, is ready for small-scale on-farm testing to work out agronomic practices, handling, and processing. More time will be required before perennial wheat is ready for ﬁeld-scale testing. In the central plains of the United States, the ultimate goal of breeding perennial grains is to develop a system that serves the ecological functions that the original prairie did; herein, we have described progress towards that goal. In the Palouse region of the north-western United States, perennial wheat could make cropping on steeply sloping land more sustainable, and a breeding program aimed at that goal has made signiﬁcant progress (Scheinost et al. 2001). In Western Australia, alternating strips of trees and yet-to-be-developed perennial wheat could serve to obtain good production, while preventing the rise in water tables that causes salinity problems. In other parts of Australia, perennial wheat could conserve soil and water; provide a new tool for dealing with persistent droughts; and improve the proﬁtability of farms that incorporate both grain production and grazing (Bell et al. 2008). Parental germplasm to develop perennial wheats for Australia is undergoing preliminary evaluation there (Philip Larkin, CSIRO, and Len Wade, Charles Sturt University, pers. comm.). In south-east Asia, systems involving perennial upland rice and food-producing trees could prevent erosion on lands that are highly susceptible (Sacks et al. 2003).

WHY SORGHUM?<br />As a food and feed crop, sorghum is an important “failsafe” in the global agroecosystem. Worldwide, sorghum is the 5th most important grain crop grown based on tonnage, after maize, wheat, rice, and barley (www.fao.org). Sorghumis unusually tolerant of low input levels, an essential trait for areas such as Northeast Africa and the US Southern Plains that receive too little rainfall for most other grains. Increased demand for limited fresh water supplies, increasing use of marginal farmland, and global climatic trends, all suggest that dryland crops such as sorghum will be of growing importance to feed the world’s expanding populations.<br />Currently the 2nd source of grain-based ethanol in the US (after maize), sorghum is a biofuel crop of growing importance. The generally lower water demands and market price for sorghum than maize, versus their equal per-bushel ethanol yields, suggests that sorghum will be of growing importance in meeting grain-based biofuels needs. Cellulosic biofuel production oﬀers compelling advantages over seedbased production [1], but will require greater utilization of marginal lands to make the low per-unit value of biomass production economical, and will be heavily dependent upon the use of perennials to be sustainable [2, 3]. A relatively advanced state of knowledge of the genetic control of perenni-<br /><br />ality in sorghum [4, 5] and early progress in functional genomics of perenniality [6] add to its promise as a cellulosic biofuels crop. “Sweet sorghums” with high sugar content in stems, already grown for forage and silage, may be especially promising.<br />The Sorghum genus also oﬀers the opportunity to gain new insights into biology of weeds and invasives. Vegetative dispersal by rhizomes (underground stems) and seed dispersal by disarticulation of the mature inﬂorescence (shattering) cause “Johnsongrass” [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers, 2n = 2x = 40] to rank among the world’s most noxious weeds [7]. Johnsongrass is an interspeciﬁc hybrid of Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum, the latter contributing rhizomatousness. Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum are readily crossed, and their progeny provide a system in which to dissect the genetic basis of rhizomatousness [4]. The same features that make Johnsongrass such a troublesome weed are actually desirable in many forage, turf, and biomass crops which are genetically complex. Therefore, sorghum oﬀers novel learning opportunities relevant to weed biology as well as to improvement of a wide range of other forage, turf, and biomass crops.<br />The small genome of sorghum has long been an attractive model for advancing understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of cereal genomes. Sorghum is representative of tropical grasses in that it has “C4” photosynthesis,<br /><br />2 International Journal of Plant Genomics<br /><br />using complex biochemical and morphological specializations to improve carbon assimilation at high temperatures. By contrast, rice is more representative of temperate grasses, using “C3” photosynthesis. Its lower level of gene duplication than many other tropical cereals makes sorghum, like rice, an attractive model for functional genomics. However, sorghum is much more closely related than rice to many major cereal crops with complex genomes and high levels of gene duplication. Sorghum and Zea (maize, the leading US crop with a farm-gate value of $15–20 billion/y) diverged from a common ancestor ∼12 mya [8, 9] versus ∼42 mya for rice and the maize/sorghum lineage [10]. Saccharum (sugarcane), arguably the most important biofuels crop worldwide, valued at ∼$30 billion including $1 billion/y in the US∗, may have shared ancestry with sorghum as little as 5 million years ago [11], retains similar gene order [12], and even produces viable progeny in some intergeneric crosses [13]. Zea has undergone one whole-genome duplication since its divergence from Sorghum [14], and Saccharum has undergone at least two [12].<br />2. PROGRESS IN SORGHUM GENOME CHARACTERIZATION<br />2.1. Genetic mapping<br />Linkage mapping in sorghum takes advantage of its straightforward diploid genetics, amenability to inbreeding, high levels of DNA polymorphism between Sorghum species, and manageable levels of DNA polymorphism within S. bicolor. High-density reference maps of one intraspeciﬁc S. bicolor [15–18] and one interspeciﬁc S. bicolor x S. propinquum [19, 20] cross provide about 2600 sequence-tagged-sites (based on low-copy probes that have been sequenced), 2454 AFLP, and ∼1375 sequence-scanned (based on sequences of genetically anchored BAC clones) loci. These two maps share one common parent (S. bicolor “BTx623”) and are essentially colinear [21]. Cytological characterization of the individual sorghum chromosomes has provided a generally adopted numbering system [22].<br />More than 800 markers mapped in sorghum are derived from other taxa (hence serve as comparative anchors) and additional sorghum markers have been mapped directly in other taxa, or can be plotted based on sequence similarity. Anchoring of the sorghum maps to those of rice [10, 23], maize [20, 24], sugarcane [12, 25], millet [26], switchgrass [27], bermuda grass [28], and others provides for the crossutilization of results to simultaneously advance knowledge of many important crops.<br />2.2. Physical mapping<br />Sorghum was the ﬁrst angiosperm for which a BAC library was published [29]. Estimates of the physical size of the sorghum genome range from 700 Mbp based on Cot analysis [30] to 772 Mbp based on ﬂow cytometry [31]. This makes the sorghum genome about 60% larger than that of rice, but only about 1/4 the size of the genomes of maize or human. DNA renaturation kinetic analysis [30] shows the<br /><br />sorghum genome to be comprised of about 16% foldback DNA, 15% highly repetitive DNA (with individual families occurring at an average of 5200 copies per genome), 41% middle-repetitive DNA (average 72 copies) and 24% lowcopy DNA. About 4% of the DNA remained single-stranded at very high Cot values and is assumed to have been damaged (thus the other percentages are slight underestimates).<br />High-coverage BAC libraries are available for BTx623 (about 12X coverage from HindIII and 8X from BamHI), S. propinquum (13-14X coverage from EcoRI (∼7X) and HindIII (∼7X) and IS3620C (∼9X coverage from HindIII). A total of 69 545 agarose-based ﬁngerprints from BTx623 BACs are also anchored with 211,558 hybridization loci from 7292 probes (about 2000 of which are genetically mapped). In parallel, 40 957 agarose-based ﬁngerprints from S. propinquum are anchored with 189 735 hybridization loci from 7481 probes (2000 genetically mapped). Targeted HICF of additional contig-terminal BACs has been used to ﬁll gaps. Each of these has been assembled into WebFPCaccessible physical maps (http://www.stardaddy.uga.edu/fpc/ WebAGCoL/bicolor/WebFPC and http://www.stardaddy.uga .edu/fpc/WebAGCoL/propinquum/WebFPC), for which earlier versions have been described in detail [32]. About 456 S. propinquum and 303 S. bicolor BAC contigs (41% of BACs, 80% of single-copy loci) appear to be well-anchored to euchromatic regions, with the percentage of the genome attributable to euchromatin likely to rise with additional anchoring. The ﬁnding that 41% of BACs are anchored to euchromatin while only 24% of the sorghum genomic DNA is single- or low-copy [with an overall kinetic complexity of 1.64×108 [30]], suggests that sorghum euchromatin includes a mixture of low-copy and repetitive DNA.<br />2.3. Genome sequence<br />The shotgun sequencing of a leading US sorghum inbred, BTx623, is now complete, with ∼10.5 million reads (∼8X coverage) deposited in the NCBI Trace Archive. Early analysis conﬁrms that the sorghum genome sequence will be a suitable substrate for a complete and high-quality annotation. In a preliminary assembly (that is expected to further improve with ongoing analysis), more than 97% of sorghum protein-coding genes (ESTs) were captured in the ∼250 longest scaﬀolds. The vast majority of these can be linked, ordered, and oriented using the genetic and physical map to reconstruct complete chromosomes. Alignments of the preliminary assembly to sorghum methyl-ﬁltered sequence; sorghum, maize, and sugarcane transcript assemblies; and the Arabidopsis and rice proteomes conﬁrms the base-level accuracy of the assembly and correct local structure of protein-coding loci.<br />Additional resources from reduced-representation sequencing will contribute to the identiﬁcation of expressed portions of the genome sequence. The sorghum gene space is presently represented by approximately 204 000 expressed sequence tags, many of which have been clustered into ∼22 000 unigenes representing more than 20 diverse libraries from several genotypes [33]. About 500 000 methyl-ﬁltered (MF) reads that provide an estimated 1x coverage of the<br /><br />Andrew H. Paterson<br /><br />3<br /><br />MF-estimated gene space [34] have been assembled into contigs (SAMIs, http://magi.plantgenomics.iastate.edu).<br />3. POSTGENOMICS OF SORGHUM<br />With the genome sequence available, one can anticipate renewed interest and accelerated progress in relating sorghum genes to their functions. Prior eﬀorts will beneﬁt from the sequence as a means of integrating diverse data types, providing for the formulation and testing of new hypotheses about roles of speciﬁc genes in particular traits. Existing data from QTL mapping, expression proﬁling, and early association genetics studies are likely to ﬁgure prominently in this merger. To fully realize the fruits of the sorghum sequence, additional functional genomics resources will be needed that provide for identiﬁcation and study of crippling mutations in speciﬁc sorghum genes, in a manner that can be targeted to the subset of genes for which sorghum is a preferred system over rice, maize, or other cereal models.<br />3.1. QTL mapping<br />Motivated by interest in a range of basic and applied questions, the linkage maps of sorghum have been employed in the “tagging” (mapping) of genes for a large number of traits. The interspeciﬁc population has been especially useful for characterization of genes related to domestication, such as seed size, shattering [23], tillering, and rhizomatousness [4]. Plant height and ﬂowering time [35, 36] have been a high priority. Similarly, the importance of hybrid sorghum motivated much research into the genetic control of fertility restoration [37–39]. Resistance genes have been tagged for numerous diseases [40–47], key insect pests [48–51], and also the parasitic weed, striga [40, 52]. Genes and QTLs have been identiﬁed that are related to abiotic stresses including postreproductive stage drought tolerance (stay-green) [53–56]; preharvest sprouting [57, 58], and aluminum tolerance [59]. Additional morphological characteristics have also been mapped in interspeciﬁc and/or intraspeciﬁc populations [21].<br />3.2. Expression proﬁling<br />Progress in characterization of the transcriptome has been paralleled by identiﬁcation of diﬀerential gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic factors, including greenbug feeding [60], dehydration, high salinity and ABA [61], and methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid treatments [62].<br />3.3. Association genetics<br />Much of the value of the sorghum sequence may be realized through better understanding of the levels and patterns of diversity in extant germ plasm, which can contribute both to functional analysis of speciﬁc sorghum genes and to deterministic improvement of sorghum for speciﬁc needs and environments. Sorghum is well suited to association mapping methods because of its medium-range patterns of linkage disequilibrium [63] and its self-pollinating mating sys-<br /><br />tem. Extensive ex situ sorghum germplasm collections exist within the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System and ICRISAT. Early characterization of complementary association genetics panels developed by a group of US scientists [6], and by Subprogram 1 of the Generation Challenge Program, is in progress. At present, more than 750 SSR alleles and 1402 SNP alleles discovered in 3.3 Mb of sequence [63– 66] are freely available from the Comparative Grass Genomics Center relational database [67]. Extensive studies of sequence variation in sorghum show that haplotype diversity is low, even when nucleotide diversity is high: for regions of average length 671 bp surveyed in 17 accessions, the median number of haplotypes was three and the mode was two [63]. Common sequence variation can therefore be captured in a small sample of accessions.<br />3.4. Need for mutants and their characterization<br />A collection of ∼400 S. bicolor mutants, now under the curation of C. Franks (USDA-ARS, Lubbock TX), provides a start toward testing hypotheses about the functions of individual genes, but a much broader set is needed, ideally providing for the identiﬁcation of multiple loss-of-function mutants in each gene. Sorghum oﬀers an opportunity to complement more extensive reverse genetics resources in for Oryza and Zea, providing for the study of genes/gene families that are less tractable in maize or rice (e.g., which remain duplicated in both taxa, but are single copy in sorghum), and also for targeting functional analyses to speciﬁc sorghum genes implicated in key traits by association genetics or other approaches.<br />To accelerate identiﬁcation in a targeted manner of mutants useful to relate Sorghum genes to their functions, 1600 M3 annotated individually pedigreed mutagenized lines using ethyl methane sulfonate have been generated for sorghum genotype BTx623 and their preliminary characterization is in progress [68]. To date, every M3 row inspected closely has been distinguishable from the original stock, and many have multiple mutant phenotypes (Z. Xin, personal communication). More eﬀort in this area is desirable.<br />Transposon tagging warrants further exploration as a means to obtain additional mutants in sorghum. Cs1 is the ﬁrst active transposable element isolated from sorghum, and oﬀers several advantages as an insertion mutagen. Cs1homologous sequences are present in low copy number in sorghum and other grasses, including sudangrass, maize, rice, teosinte, and sugarcane [69]. The low copy number and high transposition frequency of Cs1 implies that this transposon could prove to be an eﬃcient gene isolation tool. Preliminary studies of Cs1 as a mutagen (S. Chopra, personal communication) indicate the feasibility of using this transposon as a tagging tool.<br />4. BEYOND SORGHUM-BROADER CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SACCHARINEAE<br />Sorghum sprung from the loins of the Saccharinae group of cereals, which also includes cultivated sugarcane and weedy/invasive Johnsongrass and Microstegium. This curious<br /><br />4 International Journal of Plant Genomics<br /><br />group shows a 6-fold variation in genome size among closely related species with the same chromosome number (S, bicolor and propinquum versus nitidum) [70]; an apparent reduction in chromosome number from the ancestral 20 to 10 in most parasorghums [71]; at least two chromosome doublings in Saccharum since its divergence from the remainder of the group [12]; and both natural (Sorghum halepense: [4]) and human-mediated polyploidization (Saccharum cultivars: [12]). Knowledge of the mechanisms, levels, and patterns of evolution of genome size and structure in this curious group will help to reveal the path by which the sorghum genome has arrived at its present state, also laying the foundation for further study of sugarcane and other economically important members of the group.<br />Of singular importance is the role that sorghum may play in clarifying the fates and consequences of genes duplicated in recent whole-genome duplications in Saccharum, and Zea (albeit not in the Saccharinae). Zea is the less complicated of these opportunities—a genomewide (or largely so) duplication in the Zea lineage shortly followed the SorghumZea divergence [14, 72], making Sorghum an excellent outgroup for deducing the ancestral state at duplicated loci with regard to location, sequence, regulatory and other features. This opportunity is less complicated in that Zea is relatively advanced in restoration of the diploid state with regard to chromosome pairing, behaving for practical purposes as a diploid. Saccharum oﬀers insight into an earlier stage following polyploid formation, behaving largely as an autopolyploid although with varying degrees of preferential pairing in diﬀerent taxa and crosses [12, 73, 74]. Sorghum halepense, although far less well studied than either Zea or Saccharum, appears to be even closer to polyploid formation, in that its formation postdates the divergence of S. bicolor and S. propinquum which we roughly estimate to be 12 million years ago (based on ∼1.2% divergence of coding nucleotides). While it is very possible that these three polyploidizations diﬀered in the degree of pairing speciﬁcity that was possible at the outset of polyploid evolution, insight into the relative degrees of duplicate gene loss, and/or silencing would be a valuable resource toward clarifying recent hypotheses about adaptation of genomes to the polyploid state [75].<br />ACKNOWLEDGMENT<br />The author thanks the USDA-CSREES, NSF Plant Genome Research Program, and International Consortium for Sugarcane Biotechnology for funding relevant aspects of his research, and the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute Community Sequencing Program for sequencing of the sorghum genome.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: Farrell, A.E., Wagoner, P., Perennial grain development: Past efforts and potential for the future (1990) Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 9 (5), p. 381. , 408; <br/>Scheinost, P.L., Lammer, D.L., Cai, X., Murray, T.D., Jones, S.S., Perennial wheat: The development of a sustainable cropping system for the U.S. Pacific Northwest (2001) American Journal of Alternative Agriculture, 16 (4), p. 147. , 151;<br/>Paterson, A.H., Schertz, K.F., Lin, Y.-R., Liu, S.-C., Chang, Y.-L., The weediness of wild plants: Molecular analysis of genes influencing dispersal and persistence of johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense (L.)

We have identified genes expressed at substantially higher levels in rhizomes than other plant parts, and explored their functional categorization, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and association with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring rhizomatousness. The finding that genes with rhizome-enriched expression are distributed across a wide range of functional categories suggests some degree of specialization of individual members of many gene families in rhizomatous plants. A disproportionate share of genes with rhizome-enriched expression was implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism, and abiotic stimuli and development. A high frequency of unknown-function genes reflects our still limited knowledge of this plant organ. A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high (but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes. From cDNA clones showing rhizome-enriched expression, expressed sequence tags forming 455 contigs were plotted on the rice genome and aligned to QTL likelihood intervals for ratooning and rhizomatous traits in rice and sorghum. Highly expressed rhizome genes were somewhat enriched in QTL likelihood intervals for rhizomatousness or ratooning, with specific candidates including some of the most rhizome-specific genes. Some rhizomatousness and ratooning QTLs were shown to be potentially related to one another as a result of ancient duplication, suggesting long-term functional conservation of the underlying genes.

We have identified genes expressed at substantially higher levels in rhizomes than other plant parts, and explored their functional categorization, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and association with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring rhizomatousness. The finding that genes with rhizome-enriched expression are distributed across a wide range of functional categories suggests some degree of specialization of individual members of many gene families in rhizomatous plants. A disproportionate share of genes with rhizome-enriched expression was implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism, and abiotic stimuli and development. A high frequency of unknown-function genes reflects our still limited knowledge of this plant organ. A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high (but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes. From cDNA clones showing rhizome-enriched expression, expressed sequence tags forming 455 contigs were plotted on the rice genome and aligned to QTL likelihood intervals for ratooning and rhizomatous traits in rice and sorghum. Highly expressed rhizome genes were somewhat enriched in QTL likelihood intervals for rhizomatousness or ratooning, with specific candidates including some of the most rhizome-specific genes. Some rhizomatousness and ratooning QTLs were shown to be potentially related to one another as a result of ancient duplication, suggesting long-term functional conservation of the underlying genes. Insight into genes and pathways that influence rhizome growth set the stage for genetic and/or exogenous manipulation of rhizomatousness, and for further dissection of the molecular evolution of rhizomatousness.<br /><br />Rhizomes are organs of fundamental importance to plant competitiveness and invasiveness, playing two contrasting roles in agricultural ecology. As a primary means of dispersal, rhizomes are an essential component of “weediness” for many of our most noxious weeds, including Sorghum halepense L. Pers. (Johnsongrass), Cynodon dactylon L. Pers. (bermudagrass), and Cyperus spp. (nutsedge). S. halepense and C. dactylon were introduced to the United States as prospective crops but became major weeds, largely due to their aggressive rhizomes. The threat of other such escapes restricts improvement of several crops. For example, the rhizomatous grasses Oryza longistaminata (sexually compatible with rice [Oryza sativa]) and Saccharum spontaneum (sexually compatible with sugarcane [Saccharum officinarum]) harbor many genes of potential value for improving rice and sugarcane, respectively. They cannot, however, be legally grown in the United States due to the threat of their becoming weedy escapes.<br /><br />By contrast, rhizomes are advantageous in establishment and persistence of dense, productive stands of forage and turfgrasses, including Cynodon spp. (bermudagrass), Paspalum spp. (bahia and dallisgrass), Pennisetum/Cenchrus spp. (buffelgrass), and many others. Such grasses are cultivated on more than 60 million acres in the southern United States alone (Burton, 1989), and have an estimated value of $3 billion per year in the United States as forage and a national economic impact estimated at $24 billion annually (Barnes and Baylor, 1995) via meat, dairy, and fiber (wool) production. These species, together with wild perennial grasses, form a dense subterranean “net” that plays a major role in erosion control. Failure to recognize this role was partly responsible for the Dust Bowl epochs that have periodically crippled the economies of various parts of the United States.<br /><br />Botanically, rhizomes are modified subterranean stems that are diageotropic (i.e. orient their growth perpendicular to the force of gravity; Gizmawy et al., 1985) but retain the ability to spawn geotropic shoots that can become independent ramets. Rhizomes and tillers both develop from axillary buds at the lowermost nodes of the erect leafy shoot of the plant. These basal buds exhibit a clear positional gradient, with acropetally increasing tendency to develop into tillers rather than rhizomes, both in S. halepense and in Agropyron repens (Gizmawy et al., 1985).<br /><br />Several lines of evidence suggest that an overlapping set of genes may account for much of the genetic variation in growth and development of rhizomes across diverse taxa. We have previously reported on the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for several aspects of rhizome growth, in a cross between cultivated Sorghum bicolor L. Moench and a rhizomatous relative Sorghum propinquum (Paterson et al., 1995). The chromosomal locations harboring most QTLs responsible for rhizomatousness in Sorghum corresponded to the regions containing QTLs for rhizomatousness in Oryza (Hu et al., 2003), suggesting that analysis of this trait in botanical models will extrapolate broadly to a wide range of cultivated and weedy Poaceae cereals. Recently, QTL mapping of traits associated with perennialism in a cross between annual maize (Zea mays) and perennial teosinte (Zea diploperennis) suggested additional correspondence (Westerbergh and Doebley, 2004).<br /><br />Little is known of the molecular mechanisms related to initiation and elongation of rhizomes, although several well-described gene functions associated with tillering mechanisms in the Poaceae may also have some relevance to rhizomes. For example, a putative bHLH transcription factor, teosinte branched1, accounts partly for morphological differences in axillary branching between maize and teosinte (Hubbard et al., 2002). The rice MONOCULM1 (MOC1) gene isolated from tillering mutants encodes a GRAS family protein (Li et al., 2003). Anatomical and histological features of moc1 mutants advanced an expectation that MOC1 would play a key role in axillary bud initiation and promotion of tiller outgrowth. It remains to be determined the degree to which mechanisms of initiation and elongation of (diageotropic) rhizome tissues parallel molecular mechanisms determining tiller formation.<br /><br />We have sampled the population of genes that are highly expressed in rhizomes relative to other plant parts, and have explored this sample for functions, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and proximity to QTLs conferring rhizomatousness. We have compared these genes to random surveys of the rhizotranscriptome in S. halepense and S. propinquum. Insight into genes and pathways that influence rhizome growth set the stage for genetic and/or exogenous manipulation of rhizomatousness, and for further dissection of the molecular evolution of rhizomatousness.<br />Previous Section<br />Next Section<br />RESULTS<br />Isolation of Rhizome-Enriched Genes<br /><br />Two cDNA libraries derived from the rhizome tip (RT; distal 1 cm of the young rhizome) tissues of S. halepense (pSH) and S. propinquum (pSP), respectively, were studied. A total of 18,432 clones per library were analyzed by hybridizations of macroarrays with labeled cDNAs from RT, mature rhizome internodes (RMI), and pooled aboveground (AG) tissues. Relative expression levels of the cDNA clones ranged from 6.33 to 0.40 normalized units, with a mean value of 1.00 in all tissues (Table I ). For each of the two clone sets, expression levels in RT and RMI were correlated (r = 0.51, 061 for pSH and pSP, respectively). Expression levels in RT more closely resembled AG (r = 0.41, 0.34) than did RMI (r = 0.30, 0.30).<br />View this table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this window In a new window <br /><br />Table I.<br /><br />Expression profile of cDNA clones using macroarrays<br /><br />Based on the relative expression levels of RT versus RMI (RT/RMI) and AG (RT/AG) tissues, 192 clones (approximately 1%) with the highest ratios from each library were selected as candidate rhizome-enriched genes. Selected as negative controls were 48 clones (approximately 0.3%) with the lowest ratios from each library (Table II ). Of the 768 selected candidate rhizome-enriched genes, 71 (9%) clones with high RT/RMI ratios also had high RT/AG ratios. The resulting 697 unique cDNA clones from putatively rhizome-enriched genes and 192 controls were sequenced from both ends. Assembly with phred and phrap produced 343 and 393 sequences from the pSP and pSH libraries, respectively (accession nos. DN551694–DN551965, DN552280–DN552796). Phrap assembly using both libraries formed a 534-member set of nonoverlapping sequences.<br />View this table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this window In a new window <br /><br />Table II.<br /><br />Expression profile of clone sets constructed on the basis of relative expression ratio<br /><br />We also included in our analysis sequences from a prior study (Y. Si and A.H. Paterson, unpublished data), in which differential display (DD; Liang and Pardee, 1992) was used to identify transcripts present in young rhizomes but absent in rhizome-derived shoots developing into tillers. Slot-blot hybridization analysis showed that these pSHR (S. halepense rhizomes) clones tended to be highly expressed in rhizome tissues but rare in other tissues (Y. Si and A.H. Paterson, unpublished data). Among 103 rhizome-specific fragments amplified from DD, 75 were successfully cloned, sequenced, and deposited in GenBank (accession nos. BQ479097 and BQ479098, BQ656181–BQ656248, and BQ789583–BQ789587). pSHR clone lengths average only 267 bp and are largely composed of the generally less conserved 3′ untranslated regions. Therefore, to facilitate computational analysis, a search of the GenBank Sorghum (taxonomy ID 4557) database was performed. A total of 67 longer sorghum cDNA sequences identified by best homology were substituted for relatively short DD pSHR clones and analyzed along with the remaining eight original pSHR sequences.<br />Functional Categorization of Rhizome-Enriched Genes<br /><br />A set of 2,616 sequence contigs composed of randomly selected expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from S. halepense (rhiz1 = pSH) and S. propinquum (rhiz2 = pSP) libraries were downloaded from the Comparative Grass Genomics Center database (ftp://cggc.agtec.uga.edu/SorghumUnigene/fasta_file/) for comparisons to differentially expressed rhizome genes. All sequences with a significant match in the plant and/or embryophyta databases were divided into 15 categories based on their putative biochemical and physiological roles (Table III ). For all clone sources, the “unknown function” category, composed of sequences with no significant hit to the plant protein database but a significant match to non-self sequences in the embryophyta database, was the most abundant. Curiously, a significantly higher fraction of the randomly selected rhizome EST sequences showed unknown function than all differentially expressed groups.<br />View this table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this window In a new window <br /><br />Table III.<br /><br />Functional categorization of rhizome tissue-derived ESTsa<br /><br />Among functional categories, there was striking and statistically significant enrichment of genes involved with secondary and hormone metabolism in the high RT/AG group, and protein synthesis and processing in the low RT/RMI selected group. Genes related to abiotic stimuli and development were significantly enriched in high RT/RMI relative to low RT/RMI and to the random set, but both high and low RT/AG resembled high RT/RMI.<br />Genes Expressed at High Levels in RT<br /><br />Genes showing the 50 highest expression levels in RT relative to RMI and AG tissues are described in Supplemental Tables S1 (RT/RMI) and S2 (RT/AG), respectively. (The corresponding genes with the lowest expression ratios are described in Supplemental Table S3.) The pSH clone identified as c083, encoding a putative oligosaccharyl transferase (STT3), showed the highest relative expression ratios in both RT/RMI (6.66) and RT/AG (8.48) treatments.<br /><br />Several high RT/RMI and/or high RT/AG expression candidates corresponded to transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors. Five candidates (and their putative protein products), c298 (zinc-finger [DHHC-type] family protein), c110 (ribosomal protein S11), c243 (nuclear RNA-binding protein), c171 (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and c257 (26S proteasome regulatory particle triple-A ATPase subunit), map to QTL interval QRn5; AQDK006 and QRl7; sorghum regrowth on LG-C (chromosome 1) corresponding to rice chromosome 1; and the latter two to RAAB CQE43 on rice chromosome 6, respectively. A total of 10 other possible transcription factors did not show significant sequence homology with rice or were located outside rhizome-related QTL regions.<br /><br />The clone set selected based on relative expression ratio data was compared to pSHR clones isolated by DD (Y. Si and A.H. Paterson, unpublished data) and their derived sequences using the local BLASTn program. Ten pSHR clones (approximately 13%) showed significant homology (E &lt; 10−25) with macroarray-selected genes: five high RT/RMI (c155, c179 twice, c202, and s177), four high RT/AG (c121, c328, and s021 twice), and, curiously, one low RT/RMI (s010). The relatively low 13% match between the two clone sets, although much higher than would be expected if each method were randomly sampling the transcriptome, probably reflects differences related to the methods; in particular, DD-PCR may be more sensitive to identification of differentially expressed low-abundance transcripts. The incongruous low RT/RMI clone is not especially surprising in that the pSHR clones were selected based on DD-PCR products present from a mRNA pool including both mature rhizomes and tips but absent from rhizome-derived shoots. Five of the 10 matching clones showed significant homology with genes deposited in the plant protein database, e.g. cytochrome P450, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, lipase class 3 family protein, and Golgi-associated protein se-wap41 (two matches).<br />Identifying Rice Homologs<br /><br />A total of 453 of the 609 unique sequences (330 high RT/RMI and/or RT/AG, 79 low RT/RMI and/or RT/AG, and eight pSHR and 36 pSHR derived) could be plotted on the rice pseudomolecules and aligned with genetically defined intervals of sorghum (Fig. 1 ; Supplemental Fig. S1). The rhizome-derived cDNA sequences were widely distributed throughout the genome, showing no obvious bias correlating with either the species or differential expression.<br />Figure 1.<br />View larger version:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this page In a new window <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download as PowerPoint Slide <br /><br />Figure 1.<br /><br />Associations between sorghum and rice rhizomatous and ratooning QTLs and candidate differentially expressed ESTs. Rice chromosome 1 and the corresponding sorghum QTL are shown in the printed volume; figures for the remaining chromosomes are available in Supplemental Figure S1. Comparative maps with QTLs by Hu et al. (2003) are modified according to physical data from TIGR release 2 rice pseudomolecules. In Figure 1 and/or its supplements, lines drawn to rice chromosome crossbars show BLASTn-supported locations of sorghum-rice anchor markers (as described in text). Additional anchor markers with inferred genetic positions based on either the Paterson et al. (1995) or high-density sorghum map (Bowers et al., 2003) are indicated by §. Loci added by BLASTn to the TIGR release 3 physical assembly are indicated by *. Anchor markers connected by dashed lines reflect changed positions, relative to the report by Hu et al. (2003), as determined based on the current rice pseudomolecules. ♦ indicates best BLASTn hits are to other genomic positions. Other observed discrepancies in colinearity of the Rice-IRRI RD23/Olong F2 QTL 2003 population mapped markers and the TIGR version 2 physical assembly are indicated by RM and OSR markers located to the right of the rice chromosome. For example, the physical map order of three markers, OSR13-OSR16-RM36, flanking the Rhz2 locus deviates from the genetic order of OSR16-RM36-OSR16.<br />Comparison of Putative cis-Acting Regulatory Elements<br /><br />To compare putative cis-acting regulatory elements between genes expressed at high and low levels in RT, 1-kb upstream regions from the ATG translation start site were retrieved from the rice pseudomolecules. Putative upstream promoter regions could be retrieved for 395 loci, including 153 high RT/RMI, 24 low RT/RMI, 148 high RT/AG, 31 low RT/AG, and 39 pSHR. Using the PLACE database, about 70,985 candidate cis-acting regulatory elements were identified from both strands of the 395 kb of putative promoter sequences. The average number of each type of cis-acting regulatory elements from each class of genes was calculated. Because some promoter regions have many copies of one type of cis-acting regulatory element, we further categorized elements found in two or more copies per gene, only one copy per gene, or absent. Elements found in significantly different proportions between treatments are shown in Table IV .<br />View this table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this window In a new window <br /><br />Table IV.<br /><br />Summary of selected cis-acting regulatory elements located on putative promoter sequences (i.e. within 1,000 bp in the 5′ direction of the ATG translation start site) of rice pseudomolecules<br /><br />Three cis-acting regulatory elements, the pyrimidine box (CCTTTT), the TATCCA box (TATCCA), and the I box (GATAAG), showed significantly higher abundance in high RT/RMI than low RT/RMI. In particular, the pyrimidine box (Mena et al., 2002), an element of a tripartite GA-responsive complex (GARC), was much more abundant in the promoters of high RT/RMI (64.7%) than low RT/RMI (37.5%) genes. In contrast, the GA-responsive element (TAACAAR) was higher in low RT/RMI.<br /><br />In the comparison of high and low RT/AG, two cis-acting regulatory elements, CArG motif-binding MADS domain proteins (Tang and Perry, 2003) and CAACTC regulatory element (a novel GAREGARE; Sutoh and Yamauchi, 2003), were found at higher percentages (both 46.6%) in high RT/AG.<br /><br />The promoters of pSHR genes were enriched relative to the other gene sets for two cis-elements, NC II known as a plastid atpB gene promoter (Kapoor and Sugiura, 1999), and RY repeat element found in the RY/G box, a complex containing the two RY repeats and the G box of the Brassica napus napin promoter (Ezcurra et al., 2000).<br />Relationship of Rhizome-Enriched Genes to QTLs for Rhizomatousness and Ratooning<br /><br />The proximity of genes with rhizome-enriched expression to QTLs that explain genetic variation in rhizomatousness provides one means by which to prioritize candidates for further study. Using genetic markers previously described (Hu et al., 2003), we aligned 21 sorghum QTLs in 13 nonoverlapping regions (Paterson et al., 1995) with the rice pseudomolecules. Eight of these sorghum QTL regions correspond to eight of the 12 rice QTLs for rhizomatousness (Hu et al., 2003). (One case of apparent correspondence between rice QRl7 and a sorghum QTL, reported by Hu et al. [2003], no longer shows correspondence based on improvements to both the sorghum map and the rice sequence.) Similarly, among 11 previously reported QTLs influencing rice ratooning ability (RAAB; Tan et al., 1997; Ishimaru et al., 2001; Cai and Morishima, 2002) or main stem and tiller regeneration after cutting, six and four showed overlap with rhizomatousness QTLs of sorghum and rice, respectively. Of special interest is the rice chromosome 6 location of QTL AQF082 that clearly shows alignment with both the interval corresponding to the sorghum regrowth trait and the tiller number trait included in the rice QRi6 locus.<br /><br />A comprehensive assessment (Supplemental Table S4) shows highly expressed rhizome genes to be slightly enriched in the rice rhizome QTL likelihood intervals of Hu et al. (2003), with a total of 29 (6.4%) high RT/RMI and/or RT/AG genes versus three (3.7%) of the low expression ratio genes being located within the QTL likelihood intervals. Highly expressed rhizome genes were also somewhat enriched in the RAAB QTL regions, with 28 (8.5%) high RT/RMI and/or high RT/AG and three (3.7%) low ratio selected clones found in 10 of the 11 inferred intervals. The Hu et al. (2003) intervals and RAAB intervals also contained two (4.3%) and eight (17.4%) pSHR-related sequences, respectively.<br /><br />Of special interest are cases in which genes that were differentially expressed in rhizomes also mapped to QTL likelihood intervals. Two of the five annotated candidates with the greatest RT/RMI ratios could be associated with QTL intervals. The putative oligosaccharyl transferase identified as c083, showing the highest relative expression ratios in both RT/RMI (6.66) and RT/AG (8.48), failed to map to The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) release 2 pseudomolecules but could be located to the QRn5 likelihood interval using TIGR release 3 rice assembly. c087, with a RT/RMI ratio of 2.70 and a high RT/AG ratio of 2.59, maps to the rice chromosome 4 RAAB AQDK002 locus with correspondence to sorghum QTLs for rhizomatousness, seedling tillers, and regrowth traits. Among the five clones with the highest RT/AG ratios, three located to rhizomatous QTL intervals, including c083 as described above. Candidate s036, with RT/AG expression ratio of 3.38 and encoding a putative monosaccharide transporter, locates to the rice Rhiz3 QTL likelihood interval on rice chromosome 4 and corresponding sorghum LG-D (chromosome 6) QTLs affecting subterranean rhizomatousness, regrowth, and seedling tillers. The comparative map infers that s125, a putative AER-encoding gene, is also found within this sorghum LG-D/chromosome 6 QTL interval.<br /><br />An interesting candidate not shown in Supplemental Table S2 because of its more moderate (1.76) RT/RMI expression ratio is c272, which gave a best BLASTx match to the maize and wheat (Triticum aestivum) GAI gene orthologs. The best hit location on the rice chromosome 3 pseudomolecule, between markers ORS31 and RM55, does not show clear association with any rhizome trait QTL; however, the second best hit was located within the QRl1 locus (rhizome length traits) and the corresponding sorghum QTL for regrowth.<br />Paleohomeologs of Ancient Duplication<br /><br />The discovery that rice is a paleopolyploid (Paterson et al., 2003, 2004) raises the question of whether ancient correspondence in the locations of rhizomatousness QTLs might be found. Such correspondence may perhaps represent single genes with important functions or represent clusters of genes with related functions that have undergone independent but convergent mutations to account for genetic variation in sorghum and rice, respectively.<br /><br />We found correspondence between rice QTLs located on ancient duplicated segments of rice chromosomes 2 and 4 and rice chromosomes 2 and 6, together with the corresponding regions of the sorghum genome (Fig. 2 ). In the first case, the rice QRbn2 QTL for rhizome number per plant on chromosome 2 and a region on chromosome 4 affecting several measures of rhizomatousness, as well as tillering and ratooning ability, correspond closely to one another and also to sorghum QTLs for regrowth on sorghum chromosome 4, and regrowth, seedling tillers, and rhizomatousness on sorghum chromosome 6. Additional supporting evidence that this region harbors a conserved gene(s) responsible for tillering is provided by Feltus et al. (2006), who reported a significant correspondence probability for overlap of tillering QTLs between a sorghum interspecific and intraspecific population, as well as alignment with the maize chromosome 10 QTL interval for looseness of tillers (Westerbergh and Doebley, 2004).<br />Figure 2.<br />View larger version:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this page In a new window <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download as PowerPoint Slide <br /><br />Figure 2.<br /><br />Ancient correspondence between rice paleohomeologous regions associated with rhizomatousness, tillering, and/or ratooning QTLs in rice and/or sorghum. Duplicated rice chromosomal regions were identified by synteny between protein-encoding genes reported by Paterson et al. (2004). For genetic marker positions, see “Materials and Methods” or Figure 1.<br /><br />Whereas the central region of rice chromosome 2 is related by ancient duplication with rice chromosome 4, its more terminal region is related to the central region of rice chromosome 6 and to corresponding regions of sorghum LG-F (chromosome 4) and LG-I (chromosome 10). In the upper part of the chromosome (Fig. 2), the sorghum LG-I (chromosome 10) QTL intervals for rhizomatousness and regrowth correspond very closely to the rice chromosome 6 QRi6 and RAAB AQF082 loci. In turn, these correspond to a rice QTL for rhizome dry weight (Qrdw2) and to a sorghum LG-F (chromosome 4) rhizomatousness QTL. In the lower part of the chromosome, correspondence is found between the rice chromosome 6 RAAB CQE43 locus and the sorghum LG-F (chromosome 4) QTL interval for the regrowth trait. Because sorghum LG-I (chromosome 10) appears to bridge a rearrangement shared by rice chromosome 2 and sorghum LG-F (chromosome 4), there is also a tenuous association of the lower end of the chromosome with the sorghum LG-I (chromosome 10) rhizomatousness and regrowth QTL intervals.<br />Previous Section<br />Next Section<br />DISCUSSION<br /><br />We have screened the Sorghum transcriptome for genes that are differentially expressed in rhizomes, and explored their functional categorization, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and association with QTLs conferring rhizomatousness. The relative lack of information about the rhizotranscriptome is reflected in the high abundance of rhizome-expressed genes with unknown function or no match in GenBank, especially in genes of relatively low expression levels (such as the 2,616 randomly sampled genes). We identified specific genes and motifs, general pathways, and exogenous regulatory agents that warrant further investigation as mechanisms by which to enhance turf and forage grasses and control noxious weeds, through either genetic approaches or application of exogenous growth regulators.<br /><br />While gene expression patterns in the two distinct regions of the rhizome that we studied were similar in many cases, expression levels in RT more closely resembled aboveground plant parts than did those of RMI. This was consistent with our expectation, in that RMI is largely a storage organ while RT and AG are actively growing.<br /><br />The finding that genes with rhizome-enriched expression are distributed across a wide range of functional categories suggests some degree of specialization of individual members of many gene families, perhaps in concert with ancient duplication of the transcriptome (Paterson et al., 2003, 2004) followed by subfunctionalization of expression patterns (Adams et al., 2003). This may explain some of the apparent incongruities with existing data. For example, contig382, a putative lipid transfer protein, showed high relative expression ratios of 1.90 (RT/RMI) and 2.85 (RT/AG) in the rhizomes. While lipid transfer proteins had previously been reported to be expressed predominantly in aerial tissues, other members of this small multigene family are likely to have different functions in plants (Kader, 1996). Further exploration of the rhizome, an organ that is common to many wild plants but is usually absent from well-studied row crops, may reveal functions of an appreciable number of previously cryptic plant genes.<br /><br />Developmental and environmental responses of aerial and subterranean plant tissues differ in the types and/or levels of hormones and signaling proteins involved. Enrichment of the RT/AG set for genes implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism is consistent with this expectation. Similarly, the statistically significant abundance of abiotic stimuli and development genes in high RT/RMI and high RT/AG sets is consistent with the different developmental states of the respective tissues and need for response to distinctively different (aerial versus subterranean) environmental cues.<br /><br />One way to prioritize rhizome-enriched candidates for further studies aimed at identifying the genetic factors determining rhizomatousness would be to select those mapping near QTLs. Building on prior evidence of correspondence between QTLs influencing rhizomatousness of rice and sorghum (Hu et al., 2003), the correspondence that we report here with RAAB (main stem and tiller regeneration after cutting; Tan et al., 1997; Ishimaru et al., 2001; Cai and Morishima, 2002), together with a report on QTLs influencing perenniality in wild relatives of maize (Westerbergh and Doebley, 2004), lend further support to cross-taxon correspondence in the genetic control of rhizomatousness.<br /><br />While we recognize the hazards of building functional hypotheses based on candidate gene studies, a few such hypotheses of special merit are suggested. For instance, the Rhz3 interval between RM119 and RM274 harbors at least 201 rhizome EST-verified genes (Supplemental Table S4). Three of these were among the genes with most highly enriched rhizome expression: a monosaccharide transporter (high RT/AG), porphyromonas-type peptidyl-Arg deiminase family protein (PPAD; high RT/AG), and β-keto acyl reductase (high RT/RMI). Monosaccharide transporters with six transmembrane domains, which have transport activity for some monosaccharides in an energy-dependent manner, were predominantly expressed in the sclerenchyma and xylem cells in young rice roots (Toyofuku et al., 2000). Enhanced activity of monosaccharide transporters in rhizomes might be important to cell wall formation as well as to providing a carbon source for reserve carbohydrates. Other roles of monosaccharide transporters have been related to senescence pathways in aerial tissues (Quirino et al., 2001) and may prove relevant to the perennial nature of rhizomes. Little is known of the functions of PPAD in plants. The related PAD from Porphyromonas gingivalis catalyzes the deimination of the guanidino group of carboxyl-terminal Arg residues on a variety of peptides to yield ammonia and a citrulline residue (McGraw et al., 1999). Further study is necessary to elucidate the catalytic role(s) of PPAD in plant RT, if any. The β-keto acyl reductase, one component of acyl-CoA elongase, is involved in fatty acid elongation, especially synthesis of suberin monomers with chain lengths up to C26, in the cuticular wax biosynthetic pathway (Xu et al., 2002). The activity of acyl-CoA elongase showed the highest activity in maize root tips but significantly decreased along the length of roots because new apoplastic cell wall spaces were necessary to be modified by the incorporation of biopolymer suberin (Schreiber et al., 2005). Our finding that c279, putatively encoding a β-keto acyl reductase, was enriched in RT relative to mature rhizomes (RT/RMI of 1.87) was consistent with previous maize data. While much work remains to identify the specific gene(s) responsible for Rhz3, monosaccharide transporters and β-keto acyl reductase stand as interesting candidates worthy of further study.<br /><br />Another case worthy of further study is c083, encoding a putative oligosaccharyl transferase with the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression (both RT/AG and RT/RMI) among all genes studied and located near QRn5, which contributes to rhizome length and number, rhizome branching, and rhizome internode number and length.<br /><br />The c173 sequence, a putative a 60S ribosomal protein L17, mapped to the QRn10 locus accounting for variation in rice rhizome number, internode number, dry weight, and length, and sorghum rhizome number, rhizomatousness, and seedling tillers (Fig. 1). The second best BLASTn hit (data not shown) locates c173 to rice chromosome 3, in a region that aligns with a sorghum QTL for height of the main culm and tillers (Lin et al., 1995). Differential production of transcripts in plant tissues has been reported for ribosomal subunit proteins (Gao et al., 1994), and their silencing can delay development and stunt and inhibit lateral root growth (Popescu and Tumer, 2004). This information, in combination with the paleohomeolog and phenotypic relationships and its high RT/RMI expression value, provides good reason to further investigate c173.<br /><br />Correspondence of QTL locations between ancient duplicated chromosomal segments in both rice and sorghum suggests that the functions of key determinants of genetic variation in rhizomatousness may have been conserved over long periods of time. Most, if not all, cereal crops shared a common paleopolyploid ancestor perhaps 70 million years ago (e.g. Paterson et al., 2004), with sorghum diverging from rice perhaps 41 to 47 million years ago. We refine previously known correspondence between sorghum and rice QTLs affecting rhizomatousness (Hu et al., 2003), extending this correspondence to six of the 11 rice ratooning QTLs (Tan et al., 1997; Ishimaru et al., 2001; Cai and Morishima, 2002) and revealing the subset of cases that are further supported by the modern descendants of paleoduplicated chromosomal segments. While it remains unknown whether these correspondences represent single genes that have independently evolved polymorphisms in rice and sorghum or clusters of functionally related genes in which polymorphisms in different members may account for phenotypic variation, this information provides still additional clues to support identification of genes playing direct roles in rhizomatousness.<br /><br />Several lines of evidence pointed to GAs as probable key regulators of rhizome gene expression and development. Rhizomes develop from axillary buds at the lowermost nodes of the erect leafy shoot of the plant. Although auxin is recognized as an inhibitor of lateral bud growth, Chatfield et al. (2000) suggested that cytokinin may act independently as a key hormone for regulation of initiation and early outgrowth of axillary buds, such as those leading to rhizomes. After early outgrowth, however, elongation of rhizomes could be largely dependent upon GAs (Richards et al., 2001). Three cis-acting regulatory elements related to GA responses, the pyrimidine box, the TATCCA box, and the CAREs box, all were enriched in abundance in the 5′ upstream regions of high RT/RMI or high RT/AG genes. Together, these three elements compose the conserved cis-element GARC required for GA induction. Although it is most often found to be tripartite, there are variations of GARC (Gubler and Jacobsen, 1992). Mena et al. (2002) reported that the BPBF protein, a transcription factor of DOF (DNA-binding with one finger) up-regulated by GA treatment, binds specifically to the pyrimidine-box motif (CCTTTT). Their results showed that the DOF class of transcription factors was not only an activator of reserve protein-encoding genes during development but also played a part in the control of postgermination hydrolase genes. We found the 1-kb upstream sequences of the putative orthologs of eight high RT/RMI selections (c016, c027, c261, c263, c275, s045, s147, s168, s192, s207) to encode variations of a tripartite GARC. Mapping within sorghum QTL intervals characterized by all five measured traits were the four genes functionally categorized as a superoxide dismutase, a ripening-regulated protein, a CTP synthase, and an unknown protein. A fifth gene with the tripartite GARC, mapped to a rice chromosome 4 ratooning QTL and putatively encodes a PAZ/piwi domain-containing protein that belongs to the Argonaute protein family. Members of this family are reported to act in posttranscriptional gene silencing and have been shown to be crucial to plant development (Vauchere et al., 2004). Another gene shown to be under GA regulation and exhibiting tissue specificity is cathepsin B-like Cys proteinase (Martinez et al., 2003), putatively encoded by c136 that was among both the highest RT/RMI and RT/AG genes.<br /><br />Members of the GRAS gene family, GAI/RGA and orthologs, play major roles in signaling of GAs. GAI/RGA are probably best known for their influence on stem elongation, a feature brought to the forefront by the dwarfed, high grain-yielding Green Revolution wheat varieties (Peng et al., 1999). In Arabidopsis, the GAI/RGA gene may function as a negative signal pathway of GA responses (Peng et al., 1997; Silverstone et al., 1998), repressing GA-mediated growth response in GA deficiency but derepressing with binding of GAs to GAI and RGI to result in GA-mediated plant growth (Richards et al., 2001). If the altered structure of the gai mutant protein prevents binding to GAs but still represses GA-mediated growth responses, then the gai protein could constitutively repress plant growth (Richards et al., 2001). We found one contig that closely matched the Os-GRAS-17 gene (subfamily LISCL). The second best hit, corresponding to the Os-GRAS-1 gene (Tian et al., 2004), falls within the QRl1 locus affecting rice rhizome length and rhizome internode length and corresponding to regions influencing sorghum regrowth, panicle length, and spikelet number (Lin et al., 1995). Expression was enriched in RT relative to RMI. The GAI ortholog located near QRl1 is thus an attractive candidate to explore as a potential determinant of rhizome length.<br /><br />Our cis-element analysis also revealed significant differences between high and low RT/AG genes for the CArG box, a DNA-binding domain recognized by MADS proteins. The MADS genes encode a family of transcription factors with well-described roles in floral development. More recent attention has been given to the expression and effect of this class of genes on angiosperm vegetative tissues. Strong correlations between gene cladistic assignment, expression patterns, and functions have been found for MADS-box genes (for review, see Becker and Theissen, 2003). A few MADS-box genes that may be relevant to the rhizome would be STMADS11-like, ANR1 clade, and TM3-like. For example, ANR1 MADS-box genes regulate lateral root growth and architecture in response to nutritional cues (Gan et al., 2005). Kim et al. (2002) proposed that expression in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) of IbMADS3 and IbMADS4, new members of the STMADS clade, might increase both the proliferative potential of vegetative tissues as well as facilitate tuber initiation. As rhizomes are also diageotropic, it is also interesting that a MADS-box AGL20 gene was uncovered as a gravity-regulated gene (Moseyko et al., 2002). Although we did not isolate putative MADS-box genes themselves, the significantly higher occurrence of genes with the cis-regulatory DNA-binding site for MADS-box proteins in our high RT/AG versus the low RT/AG selections suggests that they may be important regulators of rhizomatous traits.<br /><br />In closing, the expression patterns, physical localizations, relationship to rhizome QTLs between two species, and putative cis-acting regulatory elements of rhizome-enriched genes in sorghum provide clues to shed further light on the identities of rhizome-specific genes.<br />Previous Section<br />Next Section<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />cDNA Library Construction and Manipulation<br /><br />Apical tips (terminal 2–3 cm) were dissected from freshly dug rhizomes of naturalized Sorghum halepense and field-sown Sorghum propinquum plants and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using ice-cold RNA extraction buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1.5% SDS, 300 mm LiCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm thiourea, and 1 mm aurintricarboxylic acid. mRNAs were isolated using the PolyATract mRNA isolation system (Promega). cDNA from S. halepense and S. propinquum was cloned into the Uni-ZAP XR vector (pSH library) and lambda ZAP II vector (pSP library), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), as described in further detail separately (Pratt et al., 2005). Mass excision of pBluescript phagemid from the lambda ZAP II vector was performed using ExAssist helper phage with the SOLR strain of Escherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). For each library, 18,432 colonies were picked by QBot (Genetix) and stored in 48 384-well microtiter plates.<br />Preparation and Hybridization of Macroarrays<br /><br />Each library was double-spot inoculated in a 2 × 2 grid pattern by a QBot (Genetix) on 22.5- × 22.5-cm nylon Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Individual membranes contained 4,608 clones (i.e. clones from 12 384-well plates) with six replicates made for each of the four membranes representing a complete library. Membranes were placed on Q-trays (Genetix) containing Luria-Bertani broth with 1.5% agarose and 50 μg/mL ampicillin, incubated for 18 h at 37°C, and then subjected to alkaline lysis fixation (Nizetic et al., 1991).<br /><br />Three mRNA sources were studied: the apical 2 to 3 cm of RT, RMI, and AG from S. halepense. mRNAs were extracted as described above from each tissue, quantified by spectrophotometry, and 10 μg labeled using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of oligo(dT)12-18 and 32P-dCTP at 6,000 Ci/mmol (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled first-strand cDNA was purified using Sephadex G-50 beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and assayed by a scintillation counter for specific activity. Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h and hybridized in a solution of 35 mL containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Church and Gilbert, 1984) at 65°C for 20 to 22 h. Hybridized membranes were washed twice with 0.25× SSPE and 0.25% SDS at 65°C and 12 rpm for 30 min, followed by a brief rinse with 2× SSC. Washed membranes were placed into phosphorimager cassettes and exposed for 20 h. After data acquisition, membranes were stripped of bound targets by immersion in a boiling 0.5% SDS solution, followed by 5 min of vigorous shaking.<br />Scoring Image Analysis<br /><br />Exposed screens were scanned and signal intensity for each clone recorded by a STORM 820 PhosphorImager. Individual signal intensities as determined by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) reflect that of the clone and filter background resulting from aligning a 96 × 96 grid on the imaged filter such that each spot occurs within one square. Signal from each probe was subsequently normalized by dividing each individual signal by the average of the field in which each square was located (a field equals one-sixth of the entire filter area, or 1,536 clones). Normalized signal for each clone was averaged with its duplicate on the same filter, then averaged again with an additional two signal values for the same clone from a replicate hybridization using an independent mRNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization. Thus, the expression level of a given clone is based on the average of four signal values per tissue source, including both technical and biological replicates.<br />DNA Sequencing and Contig Assembly<br /><br />Clones selected on the basis of differential expression ratios (as described in text) were rearrayed into 96-well microtiter plates. Deep 96-well plates containing 1,300 μL of Luria-Bertani broth with 50 μg/mL ampicillin per well were inoculated and grown for 20 h at 37°C and 200 rpm. Plasmids were extracted using an alkaline lysis method (Marra et al., 1997) modified for the 96-well format. Sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1; Applied Biosystems). Reactions were set up in 96-well PCR plates with each reaction containing 0.665 μL of DMSO, 1.33 μL of 5× buffer, 26 pm oligoprimer (forward sequence 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′; reverse complement sequence by a modified M13 primer 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′), 0.68 μL of BigDye, and 4.5 μL of template DNA. Cycle sequencing used a PTC225 thermocycler (MJ Research) programmed as: 5 min preheat at 94°C followed by 75 cycles of 94°C, denature for 20 s, 50°C annealing for 5 s, 60°C extension for 4 min, with a final hold at 4°C. Preparation of extension products was according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems), followed by passage though Sephadex filter plates (Krakowski et al., 1995) into MicroAmp Optical 96-well plates (Applied Biosystems). High-throughput sequencing was achieved using an ABI 3730 automated DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Trace files were processed using phred, followed by phrap assembly into contigs by clustering a minimum continuous 100 bp with phred score &gt;20 (Ewing and Green, 1998; Ewing et al., 1998). Assemblies were viewed and edited with Consed (Gordon et al., 1998).<br />Comparative Physical Mapping and Genetic Position Predictions<br /><br />Comparative mapping was carried out by combining the genetic alignment between the Rice-IRRI RD23/Olong F2 QTL 2003 map and rhizomatous sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genomic regions (Hu et al., 2003) with physical data obtained from TIGR release 2 rice (Oryza sativa) pseudomolecules. Along with 37 sorghum-rice anchor markers, the GenBank accession numbers for 195 genetic markers mapping to either Rice-IRRI RD23/Olong F2 QTL 2003 (for rhizomatous traits) or for RAAB the Rice-JRGP Nip/Kas F2 QTL 2000, Rice-JNIG W1944/Peik QTL 2002, or Rice-IGCN ZYQ18/JX17 DH QTL 1998 populations were obtained through Gramene (Ware et al., 2002) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Their locations are inferred based on BLASTn-identified pseudomolecule coordinates of available genetic markers. Physical coordinates for markers RM163, RM164, and RM253 were acquired directly from the reported Gramene Rice-GR TIGR Assm IRGSP Seq 2004. BLASTn against the GenBank Sorghum (taxonomy ID 4557) sequence database (downloaded August 28, 2004) was performed for those pSHR clones (as described in text) failing to identify putative homologous loci in the rice pseudomolecules. Sorghum ESTs with the longest sequence and best homology (E &lt; e−25) to the pSHR clones were selected for mapping and further bioinformatics experiments. Physical coordinates on the rice pseudomolecules for the sorghum genetic markers and sorghum sequence queries were identified by the in-house Perl script blast_booster as the best BLASTn hit meeting minimum criteria of 50-bp alignment with 80% identity. Inferred genetic positions of the sorghum clone sequences assumed a linear relationship between genetic and physical distance for intervals defined by two consecutive markers. Named sequences shown mapping to the same position identified coordinates of within 10 kb of one another on the rice pseudomolecule.<br />Gene Annotation<br /><br />BLASTx, tBLASTx, and BLASTn were used for sequence similarity searches with the default matrix BLOSUM62 and cutoff E values of 10−10 for BLASTx and tBLASTx and 10−25 for BLASTn. Stand-alone BLASTs were performed against the NCBI plant protein and embryophyta databases (downloaded August 28, 2004). Sequences were manually grouped into 15 functional categories based on putative biochemical and physiological role(s) inferred with the Gene Ontology Consortium database (http://www.geneontology.org) obtained from querying the Perl-based Inter-ProScan Version 3.3 implementation (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/iprscan). The confidence limit for a binomial proportion (P = 95%) was used to evaluate the differences between treatments in frequencies of clones involved in each functional category.<br />Promoter Analysis<br /><br />Rice genes showing significant homology (E &lt; e−10) with selected sorghum genes were identified from the rice protein database using BLASTx. The 1-kb regions upstream from the ATG translation start site containing putative promoter sequences were retrieved by either of two methods. Sequence tags of 100 bp immediately downstream from the rice ATG start codon were manually separated and used as BLASTn queries to locate their physical addresses in TIGR release 2 rice pseudomolecules. The adjacent 1-kb sequences upstream of the identified start site were retrieved from the pseudomolecules by an in-house Perl script. For genes in which the downstream 100-bp query tag identified sequences containing introns, the upsteam 1-kb sequence was obtained by searching the TIGR rice genome annotation .1kUpstream site (http://www.tigr.org.tdb/e2kq/osa1/data_download.shtml).<br /><br />To uncover putative cis-acting regulatory elements located in the promoter regions, the identified 1-kb sequences were submitted for analysis to the PLACE (http://dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE) database (Higo et al., 1999). The confidence limit for a binomial proportion (P = 95%) was used to evaluate differences between treatments in frequencies between cis-acting regulatory elements.<br /><br />Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers DN551694 to DN551965, DN552280 to DN552796, BQ479097, BQ479098, BQ656181 to BQ656248, and BQ789583 to BQ789587.<br />Supplemental Data<br /><br />The following materials are available in the online version of this article.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplemental Figure S1.

Perennial grain crops offer a new solution to the long-standing problems of salinity and soil erosion associated with conventional cropping systems based on annual plants. Seed yield and its components (culm number, spikelet number per culm, seed set, seed weight) were measured in 46 accessions of Microlaena stipoides (microlaena, meadow or weeping rice grass) from Western Australia and New South Wales to quantify potentially useful variation in the species. A high degree of variability was found to exist, with a 20-fold range in seed yield (0.1-2.4 g/plant), 5-fold range in seed weight (129-666 mg per 100 seeds), 2-fold range in spikelet number (14-30 per culm), 8-fold range in seed set (12-98%), and a 5-fold range in culm number (11-59 per plant). Seed yield was positively and significantly (P<0.05) correlated with culm number, seed set, and seed weight (r>0.55 for all). No correlation was found between seed yield and spikelet number per culm (r=-0.14). The range in seed yield and its components suggests that there is sufficient variation within microlaena to make selections for higher yielding lines. This variation will enable breeders to exploit genetic diversity more efficiently and identify useful accessions for further work. High priority traits for future work include synchronous maturity and resistance to shattering.","2005","2015-06-03 03:19:22","2015-06-03 09:52:26","","309-316","","3","56","","Aust. J. Agric.

Khush, January 28, 2003<br />Annual and perennial habit are two major strategies by which grasses adapt to seasonal environmental change, and these distinguish cultivated cereals from their wild relatives. Rhizomatousness, a key trait contributing to perenniality, was investigated by using an F2 population from a cross between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relative, Oryza longistaminata. Molecular mapping based on a complete simple sequence-repeat map revealed two dominant-complementary genes controlling rhizomatousness. Rhz3 was mapped to the interval between markers OSR16 [1.3 centimorgans (cM)] and OSR13 (8.1 cM) on rice chromosome 4 and Rhz2 located between RM119 (2.2 cM) and RM273 (7.4 cM) on chromosome 3. Comparative mapping indicated that each gene closely corresponds to major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizomatousness in Sorghum propinquum, a wild relative of cultivated sorghum. Correspondence of these genes in rice and sorghum, which diverged from a common ancestor Ϸ50 million years ago, suggests that the two genes may be key regulators of rhizome development in many Poaceae. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were identiﬁed, most of which also corresponded to the locations of S. propinquum QTLs. Convergent evolution of independent mutations at, in some cases, corresponding genes may have been responsible for the evolution of annual cereals from perennial wild grasses. DNA markers closely linked to Rhz2 and Rhz3 will facilitate cloning of the genes, which may contribute signiﬁcantly to our understanding of grass evolution, advance opportunities to develop perennial cereals, and offer insights into environmentally benign weed-control strategies.<br />T he shift from perennial to annual habit was of great importance for the evolution of cereal crops from their wild progenitors (1). Perenniality in plants may result from several vegetative organs such as root pieces, rhizomes, stolons, or tubers. Among these traits, rhizomes are one of the key features that distinguish cultivated cereals from their wild relatives and also permit many grass species to survive in harsh environments. Rhizomes are a key means of propagation and persistence of many important weeds (2), but they may also be a useful attribute under some circumstances. For instance, strong rhizomes are certainly a desirable trait for many species of turf grasses. In many mountainous areas of Asia that depend on upland rice for subsistence, cultivation has resulted in serious soil erosion and damage to the fragile ecosystems in these areas. Perennial crop-production systems (3, 4) may provide an environmentally sound and economically viable alternative for use in such areas; however, perennial forms of high-yielding rice cultivars do not exist.<br />Among the 24 species comprising the genus Oryza are four perennials, Oryza longistaminata, Oryza officinalis, Oryza australiensis, and Oryza rhizomatis. O. longistaminata is the only rhizomatous species with the same AA genome type (2ϫ ϭ 24) as cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. Distributed widely throughout tropical Africa, O. longistaminata is an out-crossing species characterized by long anthers, self-incompatibility, allogamy, and strong rhizomes (5). It has been valuable as a source of<br /><br />resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and other important traits in rice improvement (6–8). Because of the high level of molecular polymorphism between O. longistaminata and O. sativa, it was also used to construct the first high-density rice restriction fragment length polymorphism map (9).<br />Rice is widely recognized as an important model for other grasses, many of which have much larger and more complex genomes (10). Characterization of genes controlling rhizome formation and traits related to perenniality that distinguish O. longistaminata and O. sativa offers important insights into the evolution of cereal crops and provides a foundation for utilization of the rice sequence to study the molecular basis of perenniality and to identify potential targets for efficient weed control. Materials and Methods Genetic Materials and Rhizome Evaluation. We mapped an F2 population derived from a cross between O. sativa cultivar RD23 (an indica cultivar from Thailand) and an unnamed O. longistaminata accession with long and strong rhizomes, originally collected from Niger and kindly provided by Hiroshi Hyakutake (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Saitama, Japan). The F1 plant of the RD23͞O. longistaminata cross was obtained by direct hybridization followed by embryo rescue and had 32.5% pollen fertility, indehiscent anthers, rhizomes that were intermediate in size, and abundance between the parents. The F1 plant was grown in Hainan, China, and produced 381 F2 seeds by self-pollination. F2 seeds were germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium (3% sucrose plus 0.7% agar at pH 5.8) from which 268 seedlings were obtained and transplanted to an irrigated field. A subset of 228 randomly selected F2 plants, together with parents and F1, were multiplied by cuttings and planted in the field in a randomized complete block design with three replications on September 15, 2000. At the time of flowering, all plants were dug up, and the roots were washed free of soil, evaluated for the presence or absence of rhizomes, and measured for nine traits related to rhizome abundance͞growth. These traits included tiller number (TN) per plant, rhizome number per plant, degree of primary branching, number of secondary branches, total length (in centimeters), internode length (in centimeters), internode number, and dry weight (in grams) of up to five main rhizomes per plant. Genotyping and Data Analyses. A total of 181 well distributed simple sequence-repeat markers developed by Cornell University (New York) and the International Rice Microsatellite Initiative (Ithaca, NY) were used to genotype the parents, F1 plant, and F2 population following standard protocols (11, 12). The computer program MAPMAKER͞EXP 3.0b (13) was used to construct the linkage map of the F2 population. SAS PROC FREQ (14) was used to test associations of rhizome phenotypes with markers<br />Abbreviations: TN, tiller number; QTL, quantitative trait locus; cM, centimorgan. ‡F.Y.H. and D.Y.T. contributed equally to this work. ¶To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Composite interval mapping (15) was used to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by using the threshold of logarithm of odds ϭ 2.50. Comparative mapping to identify corresponding genomic regions across the rice and sorghum genomes were conducted by using common anchor markers described by Ware et al. (16) and Paterson et al. (17). Results Construction of the Linkage Map and Genomic Composition of the F2 Population. The linkage map (Fig. 1) was comprised of 181 codominant simple sequence-repeat markers spanning 1,758.6 centimorgans (cM) and covering all 12 chromosomes at an average distance of 9.7 Ϯ 6.5 cM between adjacent markers. Marker orders and locations were nearly identical to the previously published arrangement of these simple sequence repeats (12) except for five small inversions on chromosomes 3 (between OSR16 and OSR18), 5 (between RM159 and RM122and between RM291 and RM161), and 7 (between RM47 and RM18 and between RM118 and RM134). Segregation distortion of allelic frequencies from the expected 1:1 ratio was observed at 73 markers (40%) in 18 genomic regions, including 40 markers on chromosomes 1–6, 9, and 11 favoring the O. sativa allele and 33 on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 9, and 12 favoring the O. longistaminata allele, respectively (Fig. 1). Overall, O. longistaminata alleles accounted for Ϸ45.5% of the genome in the F2 population.<br />Identification and Mapping of a Pair of Dominant-Complementary Genes for Rhizome Formation in O. longistaminata. Of the 228 F2 individuals evaluated, 122 had rhizomes and 106 did not. This fits<br />a 9:7 ratio (␹2 ϭ 0.70 and P ϭ 0.40) and excludes other candidate ratios (for a 3:1 ratio, ␹2 ϭ 56.17 and P ϭ 0), suggesting that two dominant-complementary genes may largely control rhizomatousness in O. longistaminata. Two genomic regions were strongly associated with the rhizome phenotype, one near OSR16 on chromosome 3 (␹2 ϭ 40.3 and P Ͻ 0.0001) and the other near RM119 on chromosome 4 (␹2 ϭ 64.4 and P Ͻ 0.0001). Both regions showed significant segregation distortion with the O. longistaminata allele favored at OSR16 on chromosome 3 and the O. sativa allele favored at RM119 on chromosome 4. To test whether the genes at the two regions fit the model of two dominant-complementary genes that we inferred based on the segregation data, the predicted rhizome phenotypes of individual F2 plants were generated based on the marker genotypes at OSR16 and RM119 and subjected to an association analysis. The ␹2 value from the two-gene model was 113.2 (P Ͻ 0.0001), much greater than that obtained from either single-marker model. The goodness-of-fit test also indicated that the predicted rhizome phenotypes of the F2 individuals based on the genotypes at the two markers were consistent with the observed rhizome expression (␹2 ϭ 1.29 and P ϭ 0.26). However, there were 35 individuals that did not show the predicted rhizome phenotypes based on their genotypes at the two loci. These were all heterozygous at both loci and had a greater than average proportion of O. sativa chromatin across the remainder of the genome, particularly at QTLs affecting rhizome abundance discussed below, suggesting that the dominance of the rhizome genes may be modified by interactions with other genes that are beyond the resolution of our data.<br />To determine the exact positions of the two genes, we examined those F2 individuals having crossovers between the markers flanking OSR16 and RM119 and the changes (presence or absence) in the rhizome phenotype resulting from the crossovers. For OSR16, we found that crossovers between OSR13 and OSR16 resulted in changes in rhizome phenotype but not between OSR16 and RM36. In this way, the first locus was mapped to chromosome 3, 1.3 cM from OSR16 and 8.1 cM from OSR13. Similarly, changes in rhizome phenotype resulted from<br /><br />crossovers between RM119 and RM273 but not between RM142 and RM119. Thus, the second locus was mapped to chromosome 4, 2.2 cM from RM119 and 7.4 cM from RM273 (Fig. 1). We tentatively designated this pair of interacting genes Rhz2 and Rhz3.<br />QTLs Affecting Abundance of Rhizomes and Related Growth Traits. The F2 individuals having rhizomes showed considerable variation for traits related to rhizome abundance and growth. Composite interval mapping revealed 16 QTLs on 8 of the 12 rice chromosomes that affected the nine rhizome traits. The O. longistaminata alleles at all of these QTLs increased the values of the rhizome-related traits (Fig. 1 and Table 1). As expected, the O. longistaminata allele at Rhz3 increased values of all nine measured rhizome traits. However, the O. longistaminata allele at Rhz2 was associated only with increased degree of primary branching, internode length, and TN. Six QTLs appeared to be more important, and each affected more than one measured rhizome trait (Table 1). Of these, QRn3, QRn5, and QRn10 appeared to control the number and branching of rhizomes, and QRl1, QRl6, and QRl7 influenced primarily the length of rhizomes. Eight additional QTLs had relatively small effects, and each affected only one of the rhizome traits (Table 1). Comparative Mapping. Using the comparative genome-mapping tool and the Gramene database (12, 16) together with our published data (2, 17), we were able to evaluate the degree of correspondence between O. longistaminata rhizome genes and QTLs to those reported from Sorghum propinquum (Fig. 1). For instance, Rhz3 appeared to correspond closely to a major QTL flanked by csu40 and pSB188 on sorghum linkage-group D, which affects subterranean rhizomatousness, regrowth, and TN in S. propinquum. Rhz2, QRn3, and QRn10 corresponded closely to three linked QTLs affecting subterranean rhizomatousness, rhizome number and length, and TN on sorghum linkage-group C. QRl1 and QRl7 mapped to the corresponding regions harboring two QTLs influencing regrowth and subterranean rhizomatousness on sorghum linkage-groups A and B. QRbd2 and QRbn2 mapped to regions harboring two linked QTLs affecting regrowth and subterranean rhizomatousness on sorghum linkage-group F; QRi6 corresponded to a QTL associated with regrowth and subterranean rhizomatousness on sorghum linkage-group I; and QRn5 corresponded to a QTL associated with subterranean rhizomatousness on sorghum linkage-group G (2). We did not find sufficient evidence to suggest the corresponding locations of QRn7 and QRin6 on sorghum linkage groups, nor did we know clearly the rice genomic locations corresponding to sorghum linkage-groups H and J, at which two additional rhizome QTLs locate (2). To evaluate the likelihood of this degree of correspondence, specifically of 10 of 16 rice QTLs (62.5%) to 9 of 11 sorghum QTLs (81.8%), we used published methods (17) based on somewhat conservative assumptions that we could identify correspondence for Ϸ90% (1,700 cM) of the present rice map to the sorghum map and that the size of interval that we could confidently assign QTLs to was Ϸ30 cM. The likelihood of the observed number of matches occurring by chance was 0.00004, indicating that QTLs controlling rhizomatousness in O. longistaminata and S. propinquum fall in largely corresponding genomic locations. Discussion Our results have several important implications for understanding the genetics and evolution of perenniality in grasses. Annual habit represents a widespread strategy by which grasses adapt to seasonal environmental changes (temperature, water, solar intensity, and associated factors).

This notion was supported by the dominant nature of the Rhz2 and Rhz3 loci discovered in this study that control rhizome expression in O. longistaminata. The strong interaction between Rhz2 and Rhz3 and their pleiotropic effects on many rhizome traits indicate that Rhz2 and Rhz3 are likely to be regulatory genes. Both also contributed strongly to TN, a trait associated strongly with regrowth (ratooning) and persistence of perennial grasses. The dominant nature of both genes implies that a single recessive, null, or loss-of-function mutation at either Rhz3 or Rhz2 may shut off rhizome expression. Furthermore, the presence of Rhz3 mutants in more O. sativa accessions (18) suggests that the first mutation leading to the switch from perenniality and rhizomatousness to the current annual habit of O. sativa was more likely to have occurred at Rhz3. Rhz3 accounted for greater phenotypic variance and affected more rhizome-related traits than did Rhz2, implying that Rhz3 may be<br /><br />more ‘‘upstream’’ in the rhizomatousness pathway. The pleiotropic effects of Rhz2 on degree of primary branching, internode length, and TN, on the other hand, suggest its influence on the growth of axillary buds and͞or intercalary meristems. Similarly, it is not surprising that all rhizome-enhancing alleles at the identified QTLs were from O. longistaminata, because mutations at these QTLs affecting the abundance of rhizomes in the ancestral species would have become neutral and accumulated at much faster rates after the rhizome pathway was shut off by the mutation at Rhz3. It is conceivable that mutations at these QTLs were less likely to be associated with other fitness traits. Otherwise, individuals with these mutations would have been eliminated from the O. sativa gene pool long ago.<br />The close correspondence between most rhizome genes͞ QTLs in rice and sorghum suggests that some of the same genes may influence rhizome expression and abundance in these<br /><br />Hu et al.<br /><br />PNAS ͉ April 1, 2003 ͉ vol. 100 ͉ no. 7 ͉ 4053<br /><br />distantly related grass species, lending support to the notion of ‘‘grasses as a single genetic system’’ (19). Our results regarding rhizomatousness clearly fit a model developed by Paterson et al. (17) for other traits, suggesting that in many cases convergent evolution of independent mutations at corresponding loci contributed substantially to the domestication of grasses.<br />The strong interaction between Rhz3 and Rhz2 and their pleiotropic effects on many rhizome traits indicated that they are additional examples of mutations at key loci leading to dramatic evolutionary changes such as have been reported in several plants, including the tbl locus that governs the fate of the axillary meristems in maize and distinguishes cultivated maize, Zea mays L. ssp. mays, from its probable wild progenitor, Z. mays ssp. Parviglumis (20). Our results suggest that similar to tb1, Rhz3 and Rhz2 may be regulatory genes that have special importance in plant evolution as proposed first by Britten and Davidson (21)<br /><br />and elucidated further by Doebley and Lukens (22). With the availability of the complete sequence of the rice genome (23, 24), determining the locations of Rhz2 and Rhz3 represents a key step toward cloning and molecular characterization of these two important genes, which will contribute significantly to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the grass family, create opportunities to develop perennial cereals, and offer insights into environmentally benign weed-control strategies.

The identification of alternative practices requires field studies of crop<br />responses to provide appropriate information.<br />Approximately one third of the soils in the SAT are Alfisols (Kampen and Burford,<br />1980). These soils have low productivity, particularly under rainfed situations, but are<br />critical for food production for large numbers of the world population. Mullins et al.<br />(1990) note that the crusting and hardsetting characteristics found in some Alfisols are<br />also evident in other soil types in tropical and Mediterranean regions. Major constraints<br />of Alfisols include low water holding capacity, poor nutrition, low cation exchange<br />capacity, 10~ organic matter content particularly in cultivated soils, and poor soil<br />physical characteristics. Examples of the latter are such as a tendency to surface seal,<br />crust and hardset on drying and low soil strength under saturated soil conditions leading<br />to slumping, increased bulk density and loss of surface roughness (El-Swaify<br />et al.,<br />1985). Hence, agricultural practices which cause further losses in soil fertility, such as<br />tillage, make a difficult soil even harder to manage profitably.<br />A range of potential management systems exist for Alfisols of the SAT (El-Swaify et<br />al., 1985; Venkateswarlu,<br />1987). These options generally relate to soil management<br />between bunds (interbund management) and can be categorised as tillage and biologically based systems.<br />The advantages of tillage options may include increased crop establishment and<br />yields, weed control, improved infiltration and reduced runoff (Laryea et al., 1991;<br />Gupta and Moncreif, 1994) but the longevity of these effects may be short (Vittal et al.,<br />1983). The principles behind tillage are to increase soil porosity, to destroy surface<br />crusts, and to manipulate surface roughness to improve water intake (Hoogmoed, 1995).<br />However, continuous tillage accelerates organic matter loss resulting in the decline of<br />soil chemical, physical and biological fertility and subsequent land degradation (Lal,<br />1989). Tillage depths vary, depending on the purpose and availability of implements,<br />and range from shallow non inverting tillage to deep profile modification.<br />Biologically-based options include mulch-based and pasture-based systems (Rao et<br />al,, 1992). Mulches are used to protect the soil surface from raindrop impact and<br />subsequent crust formation and to reduce the rate of organic matter decline. In addition<br />to these mulching benefits, a pasture phase creates root channels and increases organic<br />matter throughout the profile. A legume pasture may contribute soil nitrogen. Both<br />mulch-based and pasture-based systems have been reported to change the soil biota<br />(Cogle et al., 1995b). Pasture/crop rotations, such as the tropical ley system (McCown<br />et al., 1985) are one example of biologically-based systems. Dalal et al. (1991) Jones et<br />al. (1991) and Cogle et al. (1991, 1995a) have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of pasture/crop rotations in tropical and subtropical environments.<br />The purpose of this study is to assess tillage and biological options for managing<br />Alfisols in a semi-arid tropical area. Smith et al. (1992) reported an experiment, which<br />commenced in 1988, and studied tillage and biologically options for managing Alfisols.<br />Their paper covered the establishment phase of the study project and discussed all<br />biophysical aspects. Few benefits to crop yield were found after 1 year in 1988, but it<br />was suggested that benefits would slowly develop overtime. In the study, perennials<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al. / Soil &amp; Tillage Research 44 (1997) 235-253<br /><br />231<br /><br />were removed after 4 years and thesetreatments cropped to annual cereals to assessthe<br />benefits of the perennial phase. Our paper interprets agronomic data for the study<br />between 1989 and 1993 for annual crops, and evaluates whether, and why, crop yield<br />benefitted from alternative managementpractices.<br /><br />2. Materials and methods<br />2.1. Experimental site<br />The project was establishedin July 1988 at the International Crops ResearchInstitute<br />for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru (18”N, 78”E), 26 km northwest of<br />Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Details of the experimental site and the 1988 crop<br />seasonwere given by Smith et al. (1992).<br />The soil is a Udic Rhodustalf (I have not checked the books on this but I think the s<br />is applied in the plural sensewhen talking about the family of soils), locally regarded as<br />a crusting, profile hardening soil. The surface texture is a sandy loam merging to a<br />sandy clay loam or light clay alt lo-15 cm and then to gravelly sandy loam overlying<br />mm-rum (a layer of decomposing parent material); the depth of the murmm varies<br />between 30 to 100 cm. ICRISAT has an average rainfall of 784 mm, with over 80%<br />falling between the months of June and October. Rainfall at the experimental site was<br />measuredwith a tipping bucket pluviometer. Average monthly air temperature in the<br />rainy seasonrangesfrom 25 to 29°C.<br />2.2. Experimental design<br />The experimental design was an incomplete randomised block with an embedded<br />factorial for the tillage by mulch comparisons.Each plot was 28 m long (down slope)<br />and 5-m wide with a land slope between M-2.0%. There were three replications.<br />Fifteen treatmentswere imposedin the experiment. These were madeup of: (a) a tillage<br />by mulch factorial for annual crops, comprised nine treatments, and compared three<br />different tillage depths at (0 cm (T,), 10 cm (T,,) and 20 cm (T,,)) and three mulches<br />(no mulch (N,), 15 t ha- ’ farmyard-manure (F,), and 5 t ha-’ rice straw (R, )); (b)<br />perennial crops, which were rotated to annual crops after 4 years comprised six<br />treatments: sole perennial pigeonpea (Pp) (Cajanus cajan L.), sole buffel grass (C)<br />(Cenchrus ciliaris L.), sole Verano (St) (Stylosanthes hamata L.) and mixtures of these<br />speciesviz. PpSt, PpCSt and CSt.<br />Between 1988 and 1991, the tillage and mulch treatments were cropped annually to<br />cereal crops. In 1992, perennial crops were removed and in 1992 and 1993 all<br />treatments, including those previously under perennial crops, were planted to a cereal<br />crop to compare the cumulative effects of different soil management histories. For<br />discussion of the 1992 and 1993, results the perennial treatments are referred to as<br />‘prior-perennial’ treatments when compared with the treatments that been cropped to<br />annual crops before 1992.<br /><br />238<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al. /Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage<br /><br />Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />Data were analysed using GENSTAT (GENSTAT 5 Committee, 1993) with data<br />adjusted to take account of the incomplete block design, prior to analysis. Adjusted<br />means are presented.<br />2.3. Annual crops: (tillage by mulch) factorial<br /><br />The crop sequence was millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) (1988), sorghum (Sorghum<br />bicolor L.) (CSH9) (1989, 1990) maize (Zea mays L.) (Proagro 3448) (1991, 1992) and<br />sorghum (CSHB), (1993). In this paper, we consider the sorghum and maize crops, as<br />Smith et al. (1992) discussed the millet crop.<br />Tillage for T10 and TzO treatments occurred after the first major rain in June and was<br />performed with a tractor-mounted toolbar using chisel tines. The initial tillage operation<br />was 10 cm in both treatments, while a second tillage 10 cm and 20 cm was performed<br />for T,, and T,, treatments respectively. There were a total of two passes in tilled plots.<br />In each year, planting (Table 1) was performed as soon as possible after tillage, but in<br />1989 and 1990 a delay of several weeks occurred because of unfavorable weather<br />conditions. Seeds were sown by hand in a furrow at double the desired plant population<br />and furrows were firmed to promote soil-seed contact. Approximately 20 days after<br />planting, seedlings were thinned to give the desired population (Table 1).<br />Fertiliser was placed in the seed furrow and mixed with soil prior to planting.<br />Nitrogen (N) applications were made 2-3 times during the crop season. Fertiliser<br />(diammonium phosphate and urea) at a rate of(100 kg N ha-’ and 46 kg P ha-‘) was<br />applied over most of the plot and has been designated as the normal fertiliser level (NF).<br />In addition, a high fertiliser (HF) subplot (2 X 2 m) (186 kg N ha-‘, 62 kg P ha-‘, 27<br />kg K ha-‘) was placed at the base of the plot. In 1990, an extra 60 kg N ha-’ and 140<br />kg N ha-’ were applied to the normal and high fertility plots respectively. Zinc was soil<br />applied as 40 kg ha-’ ZnSO, 1990 and as a 2 kg ha -’ foliar spray in 1991, 1992 and<br />1993. In 1992 and 1993, a low fertility (LF) subplot (0 kg N ha-‘, 46 kg P ha-‘) (10<br />rows by 3 m) was placed at the top of each plot to compare the N input from the prior<br />crop.<br />After planting, farmyard-manure (15 t ha-‘) was applied to F, plots and rice straw<br />(5 t ha-‘) was applied to R, plots. Both mulches were applied to the surface and not<br />incorporated. In 1992 and 1993, rice straw was applied to all prior-perennial plots,<br />except PpCSt. The rationale was to prevent the development of a surface seal/crust and<br />therefore allow a comparison of the effect of sub-surface structural changes. The PpCSt<br />treatment did not receive straw so as to be able to measure the effect of a pasture/crop<br />Table 1<br />Crop data for the period<br /><br />between<br /><br />1989 and 1993<br /><br />Year<br /><br />Crop<br /><br />Planting<br /><br />1989<br />1990<br />1991<br />1992<br />1993<br /><br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br />Maize (proagro 3448)<br />Maize (proagro 3448)<br />Sorghum (CSH9)<br /><br />19-7-89<br />12-7-90<br />22-6-91<br />25-6-92<br />30-6-93<br /><br />date<br /><br />Harvest<br />3-11-89<br />6-l l-90<br />18-9-91<br />28-9-92<br />18-10-93<br /><br />date<br /><br />Plant population<br />180,000<br />180,000<br />50,000<br />50,000<br />180,000<br /><br />plants ha-’<br /><br />AL.<br /><br />Cogle et d/Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />239<br /><br />rotation in a non-mulched situation. The farmyard-manure used contained 157 kg N<br />ha-‘, 81 kg P ha-’ and 127 kg K ha-‘, and the rice straw contained 35 kg N ha-‘, 7<br />kgPha-‘and86kgKhaa’.<br />During the cropping period, weeds were removed by hand or by application of the<br />herbicide, (Paraqat (24% Emulsifiable Concentrate (EC)). In 1991, 1992 and 1993,<br />Atrazine (50% EC) was applied as a residual herbicide at planting. To control shootfly<br />(Atherigonia soccatu (Randani)) in 1989, 40 kg ha-’ Carbofuran (3% EC) was mixed<br />with soil in the rows before sowing and was also dribbled in the whorls on August 25. In<br />1990, Fenvalerate (20% EC) was sprayed on July 20 and Carbofuran was dribbled in the<br />whorls on August 25 for shootfly. Endosulphan (35% EC) was sprayed on September 3<br />and Rogor (30% EC) on October 17 for stemborer (Chico partellus<br />(Swinhoe)) and<br />mirid (Calocoris angustutus) attack on sorghum heads. In later years, chemical insect<br />control was not required.<br />Agronomic data collected included total leaf number to the last fully expanded leaf,<br />(three plants from two adjacent centre rows at the top, middle and bottom of each plot),<br />plant population (total counts per replicate plot), projected cover using a camera set at<br />4.2 m above the canopy and analysis of slide photos by projection onto a 10 X 10 cm<br />grid (three sites per replicate plot), and leaf area index with a LICOR LI2000 in 1991<br />and 1992.<br />Crops were harvested at physiological maturity (Table 1) except in 1991. In 1991, the<br />crop was harvested lo-15 days before physiological maturity because a termite attack<br />appeared to potentially affect th,e F, treatment and hence affect treatment comparisons.<br />To ensure a uniform comparison, all treatments were harvested at the same time. The<br />harvest sample unit was 22 m of the central 6 rows of each plot for NF. The HF and LF<br />treatments were sampled entirely. Plants were cut at ground level and separated into<br />grain and fodder (remaining plant material). Grain and fodder yields, grain and fodder<br />nutrients (1991, 1992 and 1993) and 100 seed weights (1991, 1992 and 1993) were<br />determined.<br />2.4. Perennial<br /><br />cvop<br /><br />treatments<br /><br />The perennial species were perennial Pp (C. cajun), a deep rooting shrubby legume;<br />C (C. ciliaris), a clumping vigorous tropical grass; and St (S. hamatu), a tropical pasture<br />legume. The perennial species were sown alone or in mixtures (Pp, PpSt, PpCSt, C, CSt,<br />St).<br />Pp, variety ICPL88040, was sown at 1 m row spacing in July, 1988. Due to high<br />plant mortality (Reddy et al., 1992) variety ICPL9174 was sown in August 1990 and<br />gap filling with ICP11298 occurred in July 1991. As individual plants died in the<br />1991/1992 period, no gap filling was done as Pp was to be removed prior to the 1992<br />kharif or wet season. Fertiliser was applied annually at the rate of 7 kg Zn ha-’ (as<br />ZnSO,), 36 kg S ha-’ and 46 kg Ca ha-’ (as gypsum), 18 kg N ha- ’ (as diammonium<br />phosphate). In 1989, an extra 32 kg N ha-’ (as urea) was applied. Grain and fodder<br />sampling were done between December and April of each year by cutting at 75 cm<br />height; grain was threshed from fodder. Pruning to 75 cm was done during the kharif to<br />check excessive vegetative growth.<br /><br />240<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al./Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />C and St were sown in July and August 1988 in rows at 38 cm spacing. In the<br />mixtures, the species were sown in alternate rows. A similar fertiliser regime as for P<br />was applied. Dry matter harvests were conducted each year (C: 6 July 1989, 16-22<br />September 1989, 21 February 1990, 26-31 July 1990, 15 September 1990, lo-16<br />October 1990, 2-5 July 1991, 3-5 September 1991, 7-10 April 1992; and St: 16-22<br />September 1989, 26-31 July 1990, lo-16 October 1990, 3-5 September 1991, 7-10<br />April 1992). Total plot dry matter was sampled by removing plant material to ground<br />level; air drying and weighing.<br />In the dry season of 1992 (January-May),<br />perennials (Pp, C, St, PpSt, PpCSt and<br />CSt) were removed for sampling and regrowth was controlled by herbicide applications.<br />An outline of the annual crop management for 1992 and 1993 has been given above.<br />2.5. Interaction<br /><br />of soil management, water relations, nutrition and yield<br /><br />An assessment of the effect of increased infiltration on crop growth due to soil<br />management was made by plotting total biomass yield vs. infiltration. Infiltration,<br />calculated as rainfall minus run-off is used as a simple measure of available soil<br />moisture, but takes no account of drainage and soil evaporation. Run-off was measured<br />with tipping buckets at the base of each plot (Smith et al., 1992). In any growing season,<br />there were up to 15 run-off events. The cumulative runoff total was used in calculations<br />for this paper. Total grain and fodder weights were summed to give total biomass. Plots<br />were of treatment averages (each of three replicates). Two relationships were considered: (a) total dry matter for normal fertility vs. infiltration; and (b) total dry matter for<br />low, normal and high fertility vs. infiltration. The latter shows the effect of differing<br />additions of fertiliser, and compares yields from the LF and HF subplots with the larger<br />NF plot. An arbitrary line, which encloses almost all the highest yielding crops at<br />different levels of water use, and thereby defines a linear relation between potential yield<br />and water use, was drawn for each figure, using the technique of French and Schultz<br />(1984). A figure of 110 mm was used as the x intercept as suggested by these authors<br />for growing seasons receiving more than 150 mm. The slope of the arbitrary line is the<br />water use efficiency (Perry, 1987), or in this case, the potential water-use efficiency.<br /><br />3. Results<br />3.1. Rainfall<br />Rainfall distribution varied between cropping seasons (Fig. 1) and there was a<br />substantial difference (236 mm) between the wettest (1989) and driest (1991) cropping<br />season rainfall. In July 1989, exceptionally large rainfalls occurred early in the season<br />over short time periods (e.g., 162 mm over 4 days and 221 mm over 3 days). In 1990,<br />the lack of good planting rains limited establishment and early growth, even though rain<br />was evenly distributed later in the season. The lowest seasonal rainfall was in 1991 and<br />the post anthesis period was particularly dry. The wetter year in 1992 provides a useful<br /><br />A.L.

The notable aspect of 1993<br />was a low but relatively evenly distributed rainfall.<br />3.2. Annual crops (tillage by mulch factorial)<br /><br />1989-1993<br /><br />Mulching (F, and R,) produced significant (P &lt; 0.05) increases in grain yield in all<br />years; there were no significant responses to tillage (data not shown); and the tillage-bymulch interaction was only significant in 1993 (Table 2). Among mulch treatments, F,<br />yielded significantly higher than N, in all years and higher than R, in 1989, 1990 and<br />1993. R, outyielded N, significantly in all years except 1989 when R, produced the<br />lowest yield. There were no significant effects of tillage and mulch treatments on grain<br />yield from high fertility subplots, except in 1992 when mulching (F,, 4716 kg ha-’ and<br />R,, 4675 kg ha-‘)) significantly increased yields (P &lt; 0.05, 484 kg ha-‘) over N,<br />(3448 kg ha-‘).<br />In 1991, maize 100 seed weights were lower (P &lt; 0.05) for N, (14.9 g) compared<br />with F, (16.6 g) and R, (17.0 g) treatments (data not shown). There was no difference<br />in high fertility maize 100 seed weights (15.8 g). In 1992, maize 100 seed weights for<br />F, and R, were significantly higher than N, (P &lt; 0.05) for both fertility levels. The<br />values for normal fertility were 14.9 g (N,), 18.6 g (F,), 18.9 g (R,) and for high<br />fertility 15.7 g (N,), 19.9 g (F,), 20.9 g (R,).

Annual cereals t‘tillage by mulch factorial)<br /><br />1989-1993<br /><br />Grain yields from F, and R, treatments were between 16 and 59% higher than from<br />N, treatments (Table 2). These yield increases for mulched crops are attributed to<br />increased availability of water from improved soil management, as shown by Yule et al.<br />(1991). Although mulching may have provided improved nutrient availability, we<br />believe the dominant influence was increased water supply. Supporting evidence comes<br />from the lack of a yield response to high fertility on F, treatments which suggests that<br />yields under the equivalent normal fertility regime in F, were not limited by N, P or K.<br />Similarly, the increase in R, treatments was only marginal (Table 2) following the high<br />fertility fertiliser applications, although yields in N, did respond to higher fertility.<br />While there may have been a nutrient contribution from the rice straw, we consider that<br />the contribution from the annual application would have little effect on nutrient<br />availability in the current year, given the low N percentage of the straw (0.7% N). The<br />low grain and fodder N concentrations in R, crops support this. We therefore suggest<br />that improved infiltration in F, and R, treatments was the major reason for increased<br />yields and that further fertiliser addition to R, treatments would have consistently<br />achieved yields similar to F,.<br />Plant growth rate was greater in mulched crops as shown by greater LA1 (Fig. 2) and<br />plant height in sorghum and maize from F, and R, treatments. Lower 100 seed weights<br />for N, treatments provide further support for poorer growth under unmulched conditions. A delay in plant growth in a soil and water conservation context impacts on the<br />speed at which the crop can provide soil surface protection from raindrop impact.<br />Hence, benefits of mulching (a.s shown in F, and R,) to the soil surface as cover and<br />organic matter for aggregate stability (Cogle et al., 1995b), interact with faster crop<br />canopy development to provide improved water conservation.<br />The yield increases show the strong potential for increased production using mulches.<br />The increased fodder production provides support for the contention (Unger et al., 1991;<br />Cupta and Moncreif, 1994) that management practices using mulching can be implemented using straw derived from the increased on-farm production (i.e., applying a<br />proportion of the fodder produced in any year). In many countries, including India<br />(Kelley et al., 1993), straw has considerable financial value and increased fodder<br />production is crucial for acceptance of management practices, that promote organic<br />matter retention. Similarly, faumyard-manure has alternative uses (fuel, construction,<br />mulching) but is perceived as beneficial to soil structure by Indian farmers (Motivalli<br />and Anders, 1991) and increased grain and fodder production obtained from F,,,<br />mulching will further enhance its value as a mulch. However, farmyard manure does<br />vary in quality depending on its source and its method of collection (Probert et al., 1992;<br />Motivalli and Anders, 1991) and this may affect crop and soil response in any one year.<br />It should be noted, that to maximise the benefit of mulching, farmyard-manure should be<br />applied as a mulch and should not be incorporated into the soil.<br />While our results show no benefit of tillage, weed control was achieved using<br />herbicides and hand weeding, which is a form of interrow cultivation. Where weed<br /><br />250<br /><br />A. L. Cogle et al. /Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />control in farmers fields involves interrow cultivation, which may break surface crusts,<br />infiltration may be greater than in our experiment. Such tillage incurs short and long<br />term costs. Our results show the potential benefits of soil structural modification by<br />mulches, either from surface soil protection or the development of a favorable soil<br />structure (macropore development, surface aggregatestability) (Cogle et al., 1995b), and<br />presumably soil water environment for root proliferation, when mulches are used.<br />4.2. Annual cereals (following 4 years of perennials) 1992-1993<br />Grain yields of maize grown in prior-perennial treatments yielded between 14 and<br />81% more than the unmulched treatment (N,), with one exception. The exception was<br />maize from the low fertility C treatment which showed a yield depression,probably due<br />to severe nutrient deficiency causedby exploitation of the soil nutrient reserve by the<br />only non legume perennial, C. ciliaris; and perhaps an immobilising effect causedby<br />slowly decomposinggrassroots and remaining tops.<br />The grain yield benefit in prior-perennial treatments which were unmulched during<br />the maize crop was between 19 and 25% for normal and high fertility treatments over<br />the N, treatment. The important aspect of this result is that the treatment (unmulched<br />prior-perennial-PpCSt) which would be more likely to be adopted as an innovation in<br />farm situationsstill yielded more than the treatment most resemblingfarmer practice. As<br />shown in other papers(Littleboy et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1992; Yule et al., 1991; Cogle<br />et al., 1996) benefits would also apply to resourceprotection and hence the pasture/crop<br />rotation has potential in regions where grazing animals are part of the agricultural<br />system.<br />The N contribution of perennialsto the first subsequentcereal crop can be examined<br />by comparing maize grown in Pp, PpSt, C, CSt, and St with T,R,; and maize grown in<br />PpCSt with T,N, (and similarly for sorghum for the second subsequentcrop). There<br />was no yield improvement for maize grown after perennials, if straw was applied,<br />indeed N levels were similar for all straw mulched maize regardlessof the prior crop;<br />similarly for sorghumin 1993. Maize yields from PpCSt plots were significantly higher<br />(P &lt; 0.05) than T,N, in normal fertility treatments, however there was no difference at<br />other fertility levels or in the secondyear when sorghumwas grown. Further, the N% of<br />maize and sorghumfrom PpCSt plots was little different to F, and N, treatments. This<br />provides further evidence that increased water availability was the main contributing<br />factor in yield improvement following mulching or perennial/annual crop rotations, and<br />that N from prior-perennial crops was not a large yield contributor.<br />4.3. Interaction of soil management,water relations, N and yield<br />The potential water use efficiency (WUE) of 42.538 kg ha-’ mm-‘, defined by the<br />slope of the arbitrary line relationship between NF yield and infiltration, is in the range<br />reported by other authors (Perry, 1987). As discussedpreviously, increased yield is<br />positively related to improved crop water supply. Our arbitrary line drawn at the top of<br />the envelope of points, similar to that of French and Schultz (19X4), shows that some<br />treatments were yielding substantially below their yield potential. The straw mulched<br /><br />A.L. Cogle et al./Soil<br /><br />&amp; Tillage Research<br /><br />44 (1997)<br /><br />235-253<br /><br />251<br /><br />treatment (R,) was noticeable in this regard and perhaps produced below its potential<br />due to an N limitation, as imglied by the lower grain N percentages. The WUE<br />relationship also showed the unmulched treatments (N,) were growing almost to their<br />potential WUE, even though the N, treatments responded the most in percent yield<br />terms to the HF treatment. Difficulties with the sorghum pest, shootfly, help explain the<br />poor WUE relationships for the 1989 data.<br />Inclusion of all fertility treatments (LF, NF, HF) (Fig. 4) illustrates that an yield<br />improvements occurred to a certain degree with added nutrition in yield, although they<br />were generally not significant (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, but the same line enclosed the<br />expanded set of data, which indicates either that nutrition was adequate or that other<br />nutrients beside N were limiting. While we are more confident with the NF yield<br />compared to the LF and HF yield vs. infiltration data, due to smaller plot sizes for the<br />latter, this is an important finding in so much as it emphasises that yield increases were<br />due principally to improvements in water availability, via soil management, rather than<br />nutritional effects. Further investigations to confirm our findings should consider the<br />influence of different N rates, and other nutrients on full size plots to provide a better<br />understanding of the water and nutrient interactions that influence yield in this situation.<br /><br />5. Conclusion<br />Our aim in analysing the interactions between soil management, water relations, and<br />N was to broadly identify the driving factors for yield improvement in Alfisols in the<br />SAT environment. This analysis suggests that water availability, as influenced by mulch<br />treatment through reduced run-off, was the critical factor. The effect of three N rates (0,<br />100, and 186 kg N ha- ’ &gt; were also considered, although only the effect of 100 kg N<br />ha-’ rate could be linked to water availability due to run-off plot size. Further<br />investigations should consider the influence of different N rates, and other nutrients, on<br />the development of the crop canopy and consequent water conservation for different<br />mulches to provide a fuller understanding of the water and nutrient interactions that<br />influence yield. These investigations should consider a broad range of N levels, both<br />below and above 100 kg N ha-‘. In the Indian situation, the effects of differing levels of<br />residue retention need to be determined to place a monetary value on retention to<br />compare to the market value as fodder. Experimentation is also needed to determine<br />optimum mixtures of retention, nutrition and mulching and the timing of the mulch<br />effect viz it is possible to remove mulch for other purposes sometime during the crop<br />cycle.<br />These results provide key data for the development of simulation models so that<br />predictions can be made of the long term impact of soil management on crop yields and<br />economic returns. Initial attempts were made by Cogle and Rao (1994), but further<br />development is necessary usin g models calibrated both for soil management and N<br />nutrition. The development of these types of models requires greater emphasis for SAT<br />environments as both water and N are major limiting factors. Studies such as those by<br />Littleboy et al. (1992, 1996) and Carberry et al. (1992) provide the necessary basis for<br />these developments.<br /><br />252<br /><br />A.L.

These locations were recommended for resistance<br />screening against most of the leaf diseases, grain moulds and S. asiatica.<br /><br />Keywords Grain moulds; grey leaf spot; anthracnose; Striga asiatica<br /><br />Introduction<br />Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a major<br />cereal crop in Tanzania. Because of the broad genetic diversity in the local land cuitivars, sorghum grows under a wide range of agroecoiogical conditions (Doggett, 1980; Mann, Kimber and Miller, 1983). More than 95% of the total sorghum is produced by subsistence farmers; it is consumed in the form of thick<br />porridge (Ugali). Since the mid-1970s there has been a<br />sequence of dry years throughout Tanzania, and drought-tolerant cultivars of sorghum were released in the marginal rainfall areas by the National Sorghum Improvement Program (Mitawa, Saadan and Mudolwa, 1985). Among the released cultivars, cvs Tegemeo and Lulu were white grain sorghums while cv. Serena had brown grain. These three cultivars are now extensively cultivated and the average sorghum production has gone up by 10% (SADCC/ICRISAT, 1989). With the introduction and expansion of high-yielding cultivars in<br />monoculture, diseases and Striga spp. have become<br />increasingly important constraints to sorghum production in Tanzania (Ebbels and Allen, 1979; Shao, 1984). The objective of this survey was, therefore, to determine the prevalence of sorghum diseases and parasitic weeds in the different agroecological zones<br />and to identify locations where diseases and Striga spp.<br />develop consistently at high frequencies under natural<br />tTo whom correspondenceshould be addressed<br />0261-2194/93/03/0183-06 1993 Butterworth-HeinemannLtd<br /><br />infection conditions so that these locations can be used for future resistance screening.<br />Materials and methods<br />Surveys were conducted between the 1986 and 1990 crop growing seasons, both in farmers' fields and at research stations in the two agroecological zones<br />(Table 1 and Figure 1). At research stations, diseases<br />were recorded in several national and international introductions which included improved high-yielding cultivars. In farmers' fields, diseases were monitored both on local land-races and on improved sorghums. The crop was between the flowering and hard-dough growth stages (Vanderlip and Reeves, 1972) during these surveys.<br />The incidence of diseases and of Striga spp. (percent-<br />age plants affected) was visually assessed on a rating scale of 1-5 (1, no disease; 2, 1-5%; 3, 6-20%; 4, 21-<br />50%; 5, &gt; 50% plants infected). Disease and Striga<br />spp. incidence was recorded in 300 plants in random rows in a field. The incidence in each field in a location was used to calculate the location average in a year. These averages indicate relative prevalence of diseases<br />and Striga spp. during the year of survey.<br />Disease samples from different locations were sent to the CAB International Mycological Institute (IMI), Kew, Surrey, UK, for detailed identification and<br />verification.

The incidence of various sorghum diseases and Striga spp. varied between years (Table 3). Most of these diseases and Striga spp.<br />have been reported previously (Tarr, 1962). The presence of Acremonium wilt was confirmed and the pathogen identified only to generic level. Oval leaf spot<br />(Ramulispora sorghicola) was recorded for the first time in Tanzania. Striga euphracoides, although repor-<br />ted earlier (Tarr, 1962), was not observed. The most<br />common diseases and Striga spp. that were encountered<br />consistently during the survey period are described below.<br />Most common diseases and Striga spp.<br />Grain moulds (several fungi). Grain moulds were<br />found, caused by several unspecialized fungi, and<br />Fusarium spp. were dominant. Disease incidence was always highest at Ilonga (Table 3) because this location<br />had high rainfall and humidity during grain filling. Mouldy grains were also observed in the marginal rainfall areas in seasons when rainfall continued even after flowering of the crop. Thus, grain moulds are the<br />most common panicle problem in Tanzania (Table 4).<br />Local sorghums escaped these problems because they were late maturing; however, newly developed sorghum cultivars were found filling grains during the middle of the rainy season, and had more severe grain mould than land-race cultivars. On the basis of the first two years of survey results, screening for grain mould resistance was started at Ilonga. Brown sorghums (IS 9470, IS 23599, IS 24995, cv. Framida and cv. Serena) were found to be more resistant to grain mould than white sorghums (cvs Lulu and Tegemeo).<br /><br />Grey leaf spot (Cercospora sorghi Ell. &amp; Ev.). Grey<br />leaf spot was widely distributed throughout Tanzania. Disease severities were higher in farmers' fields than in research stations. Grey leaf spot incidence was higher in the low-altitude (~&lt; 1000 m) zone than in the mid-<br />altitude (&gt; 1000 m) zone (Table 4). Anthracnose /Colletotrichum graminicola (Ces.) Wilson]. The presence of the disease (Tarr, 1962) was<br />confirmed. Anthracnose occurred from the low- to the mid-altitude region. Shao (1984) reported a high incidence of anthracnose at Mlingano and Ilonga research stations. During 1986-1990, the disease was observed at Ilonga, Hombolo, Mwanhala, Ukiriguru<br />and lfakara (Table 4). A high incidence (&gt; 80%) was<br />observed only at Ukiriguru in 1990. Sorghum cultivars such as cvs Serena, Framida, Segaolane and the hybrid DC 75, from southern African countries, were less susceptible to anthracnose. Similarly, sorghum line SC 326-6 from Texas A&amp;M University and the USAID Collaborative Research Support Program on International Sorghum and Millet (INTSORMIL) USA, and sorghum lines IS 18688 and R 6956 from the ICRISAT Center, India and SADCC/ICRISAT, Zimbabwe, respectively, had low anthracnose severities.

Low incidences of the disease were found in farmers' fields at Gairo and Ifakara and at the Singida and Ukiriguru research stations (Table 4). The effect of this disease on the crop yield appeared to be relatively mild, possibly because it tended to appear during the grain development growth<br /><br />stage of the crop. However, late-planted sorghums were found to be susceptible to rust: cultivars such as cvs Tegemeo, Lulu and Serena all developed high rust severities (&gt; 50%) towards maturity.

Surveys were conducted only in 1990 at lfakara, therefore not included in Table 3. eStriga asiatica was also observed (incidence = 5) at Naliendele and Mlingano locations in the low-altitude zone. Other diseases and Striga spp. were not observed at these locations. Similarly, at Mwanhala in the mid-altitude zone, the incidences of S. asiatica and long smut were 5 on I-5 rating scale. Other diseases and Striga spp. were not present, therefore not included in Tables 3 and 4.<br /><br />Leaf blight [Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) Leonard and Suggs.]. Leaf blight occurred everywhere from the low- to the mid-altitude region, but had a higher incidence in the mid- than in the low-altitude region (Table 4). Disease severities were consistently higher at the Iduo Seed Farm and in farmers' fields at Singida than at Hombolo, Ilonga and Ukiriguru research stations. Iduo Seed Farm was identified as a location for resistance screening. Most of the sorghum cultivars were highly susceptible to leaf blight in the Singida area, except cvs Tegemeo and Serena.<br />Ladder leaf spot (Cercospora fusimaculans). Ladder leaf spot disease of sorghum, apparently distinct from grey leaf spot, was observed in Tanzania in the 1940s (Wallace and Wallace, 1947). Ladder leaf spot caused by the fungus Cercospora fusimaculans was recently identified from Rwanda and Comayagua (Honduras) by Wall et al. (1987). Its scalariform or ladder-like elliptical lesions made it distinguishable from grey leaf spot. The disease was observed from the low- to the mid-altitude zones, at the research stations at Ilonga, Gairo, Hombolo, Ukiriguru and Ifakara as well as in farmers' fields in the Singida area (Table 4). High disease severities (&gt; 60%) were observed on sorghum introductions.<br />Sooty stripe/Ramulispora sorghi (Ell. &amp; Ev.) Ofive &amp; Lafebvre]. Sooty stripe occurred from the low- to the mid-altitude zones. Disease incidence in general was low, except at Hombolo and Ifakara (Table 4). At Hombolo, most of the improved sorghums, apart from Tegemeo, were found to be highly susceptible to sooty stripe.<br />Zonate leaf spot (Gloeocercospora sorghi Bain &amp; Edg.). A high incidence of zonate leaf spot was observed at Ifakara, a location with a high rainfall in the lowaltitude zone. A low incidence of zonate leaf spot was recorded at Gairo, Ilonga, Singida and Ukiriguru research stations and in farmers' fields (Table 4). Many<br /><br />improved sorghums from the Tanzanian national programme were susceptible to zonate leaf spot.<br />Striga spp. Tanzania lies in a unique belt of the tropics where the three most important species of Striga in Africa, namely S. asiatica L. Kuntze, S. hermonthica (Del) Benth., and S. forbessi Benth. exist sympatrically. In the past, S. hermonthica has received particular attention with regard to resistance breeding (Doggett, 1982). However, from this survey it has become apparent that S. asiatica is the most common and widely distributed species throughout Tanzania. S. asiatica was found at a high incidence on sorghum and other cereal crops at Hombolo, Mwanhala, Mwele and Naliendele areas. Recently, at Mwele Seed Farm, Tanga, 30 ha of land were abandoned, as far as sorghum and maize seed production are concerned, because of a severe and protracted outbreak of S. asiatica (personal observation during these surveys). Mwele appeared to be a good location for screening for resistance to S. asiatica.<br />S. hermonthica still had a localized distribution in the areas near Lake Victoria up to Kisumu in Kenya. Crops affected included sorghum, maize and finger millet. Pearl millet was relatively free of both S. asiatica and S. hermonthica. The Ukiriguru research station could serve as a location to screen for resistance against these two species of Striga.<br />S. forbesii also had a localized distribution and was observed only in the low-altitude zones, in particular at Ilonga research station and in nearby farmers' fields; it was also observed in maize fields. The distribution of the parasite is not well known and needs more intensive survey. Local cv. Bangala appeared to be more susceptible to S. forbesii.<br />Other diseases<br />Downy mildew. Wallace (1952) reported downy mildew [Peronosclerospora sorghi (Weston &amp; Uppal) Shaw] to be widespread and sometimes very destructive in<br /><br />CROP PROTECTION Vol. 12 May 1993<br /><br />Diseases of sorghum in Tanzania: A. M. Mbwaga et aL 187<br /><br />Tanzania. It was always observed sporadically at Ilonga and Ukiriguru research stations. High incidences (&gt; 30%) were observed in farmers' fields in Singida, affectinglocalsorghum cv. Mbangala. However, another sorghum cv. Baganhilo was found to be resistant. Similarly, Tegemeo and Serena did not show any downy mildew symptoms but were observed to be susceptible in plots affected by downy mildew in Zambia and Zimbabwe.<br />Ergot. The honey/sugary disease or ergot (Sphacelia sorghi McRae imperfect state of Claviceps sorghi Kulk et al.) was first reported in Tanzania by Mason (1926). Since then it has been consistently observed in the country (Wallace, 1937; Wallace and Wallace, 1949; Tarr, 1962, Doggett, 1980; De Milliano et al., 1991a). A low incidence of ergot infection was observed in lowto mid-altitude regions and at Hombolo, Ilonga and Ukiriguru research stations. Ergot was observed mainly in introduced sorghum populations and on male-sterile hybrid parents. An increased use of male sterility and the introduction of unadapted germplasm are likely to enhance the development of ergot.<br />Covered kernel smut. Wallace (1937) reported incidences of covered kernel smut [Sporisorium sorghi (Ehrenberg) Link (syn. Sphacelotheca sorghi Link) Clinton] ranging from 8 to 100% in farmers' fields. Between 1986 and 1990 the disease reached a high incidence (40%) in only one of the farmers' fields in the Singida area; it also occurred in the Dodoma region and at the Hombolo research station. Covered kernel smut can be effectively controlled by treating the seed with chemicals such as thiram. Tegemeo, a cultivar from Tanzania, was less susceptible to covered kernel smut than was cv. Segaolane from Botswana.<br />Head smut. During the 1988-1989 season, head smut [Sporisorium reilianum (Kiihn) Langdon &amp; Fullerton (syns.) Sphacelotheca reilianum (Kiihn) Clinton and Sorosporium reilianum (Kiihn) McAlpine] was observed in local sorghums in farmers' fields in the Singida area. In the 1989-1990 crop season, low incidences of head smut were recorded at Hombolo and Ukiriguru research stations and in nearby farmers' fields. Similarly, disease was sporadic in farmers' fields in Dodoma region.<br />Long smut. The disease [Tolyposporium ehrenbergii (Kiihn) Patouillard] was reported as being of little importance in Tanzania (Tarr, 1962). Between 1986 and 1990 it was observed only in the mid-altitude region. However, recently long smut has been observed in low-altitude regions of Tanzania and in other southern African countries (De Milliano et al., 1991b). Long smut was consistentlyobserved at a high frequency in Bihawana in Tanzania; this location could, therefore, be used for resistance screening. Long smut was also recorded in farmers' fields in the Hombolo and Lubaga areas. The incidence of this disease in this area was low (&lt; 2%).<br /><br />Loose kernel smut. A sporadic incidence (&lt; 1%) of loose kernel smut [Sphacelotheca cruenta (Ktihn) Potter] was observed at Hombolo and Ilonga research stations at a late stage of sorghum development. Disease mainly affected ratoons and secondary tillers.<br />Rough leaf spot. Wallace (1937) reported that rough leaf spot (Ascochyta sorghina Sacc.) attacked seedlings, showing long grey lesions on the leaves and raised black pycnidia of the fungus which gave a sandpaper-like roughness, but caused little damage on older plants. Low incidences of rough leaf spot were observed in farmers' fields in the Singida area and at the Ukiriguru research station.<br />Undetermined leaf spot. Symptoms similar to oval leaf spot (Ramulispora sorghicola Harris) were observed in farmers' fields in the Singida area and at Ukiriguru and Ilonga research stations. Disease was moderately severe on local sorghums. The identity of the pathogen could not be confirmed.<br />Wilt. Symptoms similar to Acremonium wilt were observed at Ilonga, Hombolo and Ukiriguru research stations; wilt incidence was low. In 1988, the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) International Mycological Institute, isolated only Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon from the diseased samples; however, samples sent to them in 1989 revealed the presence of Acremonium sp. F. moniliforme was earlier reported as a cause of sorghum stalk rots in Tanzania (Wallace and Wallace, 1949).<br />Stalk rots. Charcoal rot caused by pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) G. Goid. was observed only at IIonga during the 1989-1990 cropping season. It was reported to be associated with F. moniliforme and sorghum cv. Martin was found to be susceptible (Wallace, 1952).<br />Diseases caused by viruses. Low incidences of virus diseases were observed only at the research stations at Hombolo, Ilonga and Ukiriguru. The identity of the viruses could not be established; however, symptoms resembling maize stripe virus infection were observed.<br />Diseasescausedbybacteria. A few plants with symptoms resembling bacterial leaf stripe (Pseudomonas andropogonis Smith.) and bacterial leaf streak [Xanthomonas campestris pv. holicicola (Elliot) Dye.] were observed in both farmers' fields and research stations at Ilonga and Ukiriguru. The identities of the bacteria causing these diseases need confirmation.<br />Summary and conclusions<br />The surveys carried out in the two major sorghumgrowing agroecological zones of Tanzania indicated that grain moulds, grey leaf spots, anthracnose, rust<br /><br />CROP PROTECTION Vol. 12 May 1993<br /><br />188 Diseases of sorghum in Tanzania: A. M. Mbwaga et aL<br />and leaf blight are the most important and widespread diseases. Downy mildew, ergot and sooty stripe are the diseases of growing importance; other diseases are of minor importance. S. asiatica is the most important parasitic weed in Tanzania.<br />On the basis of these surveys, the ICRISAT Center, SADCC/ICRISATand National Sorghum Improvement Program of Tanzania have given priority to the initiation of collaborative research on major diseases and S. asiatica in Tanzania. Investigations are aimed at developing cultivars resistant to these diseases and S. asiatica. Sources of resistance to grain mould, leaf blight, anthracnose, downy mildew diseases of sorghum and S. asiatica have been identified. These sources are being tested or used in the region where these diseases and Striga problems are serious and widespread. Seeds of resistant lines are maintained by the Genetic Resources Unit and Cereals Pathology Unit at ICRISAT and are available on request.<br />Notes and acknowledgements<br />Submitted as Journal Article No, 1273 by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).<br />The authors are grateful to the CAB International Mycological Institute (IMI) Ferry Lane, Kew, Surrey, UK; Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, UK, and Wye College, Ashford, Kent, UK for identifying and confirming the causal agents of fungal diseases.<br /><br /></p>","","","Anthracnose; full text added; Grain moulds; grey leaf spot; ratoon* W/5 sorghum; relevant; ScienceDirect; search.sorghum; SPV; Striga asiatica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At 50% FC the critical concentrations were higher than at FC.<br /><br />Introduction<br />One of the features of sustainable agriculture is its lower dependence on chemical fertilizer and recycling of on-farm residues to maintain or improve fertility of the soils (Parr et al. 1990). Earlier studies have shown that organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in soil increased due to addition of corn stalks (Larson et al. 1972), wheat straw (Black, 1973), loppings (leaves and twigs) of Leucaena leucocephala (Narkhede et al. 1984; Subba Reddy et al. 1991).<br />However, the C/N ratio of the crop residues is important in governing the rate of N cycling that occurs. This is more relevant where crop residues are used to supplement fertilizer N either<br /><br />in part or as a whole. Crop residues with C/N ratio below 30 are expected to result in net N mineralization, whereas C/N ratio wider than 30 favour immobilization (Alexander, 1977; Harmsen and Van Schreven, 1955). If immobilization occurs, at least a portion of the immobilized N will be bound very strongly and this probably will not be readily available to plants (Scherer and Mengel, 1983). Apart from C/N ratio, moisture availability also plays an important role in the process in N mineralization (Parr and Papendick, 1978).<br />Keeping in view the importance of residue management for the N supply in sustainable agriculture in drylands, the present study was conducted to estimate N availability as related to<br /><br />210<br /><br />the duration of decomposition and chemical composition of the residues under two soil moisture availability conditions.<br />Materials and methods<br />Surface soil (0-15 cm depth) used in the investigation was collected from Hayathnagar Research Farm of Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad (78°36' E longitude and 17o18' N latitude). The soil of the research farm is red loamy sand representing Alfisol and related soil order with pH6.0 (1:2 soil:water suspension). Before incubation, the soil sample was air dried, stubble and root were removed by hand and crushed gently to pass through 2mm sieve.<br />Five locally available crop residues were collected, air dried and ground to pass through 0.25mm sieve (Table 1). Complete above ground portions of sorghum and mungbean after removing the reproductive parts were used. Loppings of Leucaena leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea were collected from 3 and 2 year old plants, respectively. Groundnut seeds were removed from the pods, and the shells were used. In addition to crop residues, farm yard manure (FYM) collected from the research station manure pit was used as one of the treatments. An unamended control soil, without any residue addition was also incubated. Total C and N contents in the residues were estimated by wet digestion method of Walkley and Black (1934) and micro-Kjeldahl method (Piper, 1966), respectively.<br />Residues and FYM were added to a 2 kg soil in an amount to supply 40 kg N ha -1. To arrive at this value, per cent N content of the residues on oven dry basis and amount (2.24 x 106 k g h a -1) of soil present in furrow slice of<br /><br />plough layer (0-15cm) were used. After thorough mixing, the soil + residue mixture was transferred to glass jars. Water was added to obtain FC (12.5% V/V) and 50% FC (8.4% V/ V). Each treatment had three replications. Incubation was carried out under aerobic conditions in an incubator at 28-+ 1°C. The mouth of the glass jars were covered by pieces of muslin cloth. To maintain soil moisture at FC and 50% FC, water was added in alternate days to compensate for what was lost by evaporation. The incubation reaction was allowed for 120 days, sub-soil samples were taken at 10 days interval. Nitrogen in soil was estimated by alkaline permanganate method where chemical N availability index was NHe-N released on distillation with alkaline KMnO 4 (Bremner, 1965; Subbiah and Asija, 1956). Net N release from residues was calculated by subtracting the values of the unamended soil from the N estimated for residue-treated soils. Models for predicting N release were fitted through SYSTAT statistical software package (SYSTAT, 1985). Mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates was determined by dry sieving method (Van Bavel, 1949) at 120 days of incubation.<br />Results and discussion<br />Nitrogen release<br />Nitrogen availability in soil increased with time of incubation. Linear regression equations between estimated N and time of incubation were fitted. Coefficients of determinations (R2) were significant at both 50% FC and FC moisture conditions with all the residues used in the study except mungbean stover at FC (Table 2a and b). Addition of sorghum stover resulted in decrease of available N over control upto about 90 days,<br /><br />Table 1.

Among the residues, mungbean released higher N. The performance of L. leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea was similar, next to mungbean. Further, the slopes of the regression equations revealed that rate of release of N was generally higher with decrease in N concentration of the residues. Concentration of available N was higher at FC than at 50% FC in all the cases studied. The significance of the best fitted linear equations is that the model can be used to estimate the amount of N expected to be available at a given time of incubation.<br />Percent N released and N concentration of the residues<br />The relationship between percent N released (of total N of the residues) at different time intervals and the square root of the N concentration of the organic residues was significant at 50% FC and<br /><br />FC conditions (Table 3). However, at FC, the values for R 2 were not significant at 30 and 120 days incubation periods. From the slope of the regression equations, it is evident that N released per unit square root of N concentration decreased with increase in period of incubation at both the moisture conditions. The critical N factors, defined as the N concentration at which neither N release nor immobilization would occur, were found to vary between 10.3 to 0 . 3 g k g -I at FC and 13.7 to 0 . 2 g k g -1 at 50% FC at 28 + 1°C. The values decreased with increase in incubation period. The critical N factor at 35°C for 28 days interval was reported to range from 16.6 to 20.0gkg -1 (Iritani and Arnold, 1959). The value for N factor as low as 8.0 g kg 1has been calculated by Vigil and Kissel (1991) for 140 days incubation period at 23°C from the data reported by Frankenberger and Abdelmagid (1985).

Though the equation was computed from the data of five crop residues, yet 63.5-87.7 and 81.4-93.0% of the variability in the measured amount of N at FC and 50% FC, respectively could be explained using these relationships.<br />Percent N released and C / N ratios<br />Percent N released from the total N of the residues at 30, 60 and 90 days of incubation intervals was negatively correlated with C/N<br /><br />ratios at both 50% FC and FC moisture conditions. The coefficients of determination (R z) of linear regression model were found significant for 30, 60 and 90 days incubation periods at both the moisture conditions. However, significant relationship was not observed at 120 days incubation at either of the moisture regimes (Table 4). Per cent N released per unit C/N ratio decreased with the incubation period at both the moisture regimes. The magnitude of the coefficients of determination (R 2) of regression equations at 1% level of significance confirmed the higher degree of fitness of the prediction models upto 90 days of incubation periods.<br /><br />Table 4.

A C/N ratio of 40 which corresponds to a N concentration of about 10gkg -t residue (assuming residue C is 400 g kg 1) has been reported as the break point between mineralization and immobilization for a crop growing season (Vigil and Kissel, 1991). The increasing trend of critical C / N ratios with incubation periods is indicative of the fact that even the residues possessing higher C/N ratios could be used, provided enough time is permitted for decomposition reaction. This model would have great implication in residue management under intensive cropping systems.<br />The influence of the addition of organic residues on MWD of soil aggregates, studied at the end of 120 days incubation period indicated the importance of organic residues in ameliorating the physical condition of the soil (Fig. 1). Maintaining moisture at FC resulted in increased MWD as compared to 50% FC. Use of loppings of perennial pigeonpea was most effective in increasing the MWD of soil aggregates at both the moisture conditions. Earlier Campbell et al. (1986) found that manure application had the effect of stabilizing soil aggregation, probably through the production of humic colloids.

Polymers produced by bacteria may be adsorbed by soil surface and microorganisms may bind soil particles by adsorbing to them (Tisdall and Oades, 1982).<br />Discussion and conclusion<br />In this investigation we had the intention to find out the pattern of release of N from residues under varying soil moisture conditions by estimating N by alkaline KMnO 4 method as a chemical index of N availability. The difference in measured N between the treated and unamended treatment gave the quantity of net N released due to crop residue incorporation in soil. Nitrogen released or immobilized eg. at 30 days of incubation at 50% FC can be determined from the equations presented in Table 2a. Nitrogen immobilization with sorghum stover application alone was thus evident. Similar derivations can be made for a given time (up to 120 days) under either of the soil moisture regimes using the equations presented in Table 2b.<br />Although the results of the incubation study conducted at near optimum conditions with finely ground residues may not reflect the pattern under field conditions, nevertheless, it will provide some understanding about the residue decomposition and N release. It is evident that incorporation of non-leguminous residue with wide C / N ratio, viz. sorghum will lead to N unavailability due to immobilization during a greater part of crop growth. Eventually, this residue N might not be available to crop but may depress the yield due to immobilization of soil N. Addition of adequate fertilizer N along with sorghum residue may thus be called for to offset the immobilization effect. Higher release of N, as was seen from the slopes of the regression equations in Table 2b, with organic residues containing lower N concentration might have been due to higher availability of substrates for microbial proliferation. In this study organic residues were added to supply 4 0 k g N h a -1. Consequently, the amount of organic C that was added was more with lower N concentration materials.<br /><br />214<br />Leguminous residues, viz. mungbean stover, loppings of perennial pigeonpea and L. leucocephala, and groundnut shell affected net N release from the beginning and can be used for raising crops. Similar findings were also reported by Smith and Sharpley (1990). It has to be seen experimentally whether these sources alone can meet the N demand of the crops or supplementation with fertilizer N would be required. N availability pattern, as observed under 50% FC, provided information regarding the possibility of use of these residues under dryland conditions where crops often experience sub-optimal water supply. The observation on release of N from materials having C / N ratio less than 30 is in agreement with the suggestion of Alexander (1977).<br />The relationship of estimated N with N concentration or C/N ratio as a function of time and moisture availability has helped to predict the expected N flux replenishing the N availability pool based on N concentration and C/N ratio of the residues. We have worked out the expected NH]-N mineralized plus that oxidizable labile pool of N ( N H e - N ) which is anticipated during the crop growth period at different times, viz. 30, 60, 90 and at 120 days of incubation under two moisture situations. The available N content will increase with time, N concentration of residues and at higher moisture availability (FC). Stanford and Epstein (1974) related soil water content to the amounts of N mineralized under various soils and cropping systems. With water contents between 60 and 100% of field capacity, the rates of decomposition of residues and transformation of nutrients were greatest (Power and Legg, 1978). In this investigation we have observed that the critical C/N ratios, below which release of N and above which immobilization would occur were 46 and 39 at FC and 50% FC, respectively. Two points are interesting to note i) critical C / N ratio is higher than the generally believed ratio of about 30, and ii) release of N can occur in residue containing wider C/N ratio at FC than at 50%FC moisture. It was also observed that N release would occur even with the wider C/N ratios, provided adequate time for decomposition is allowed, as microbial immobilization would be greater at initial stages after organic addition. This was true both under FC and 50% FC conditions.<br /><br />Acknowledgements<br />This research was supported by the USIF Grant<br />(No. FG-IN-717, IN-ARS-677) under the Indo-<br />US collaborative research on dryland agriculture<br />sponsored by USDA/OICD/FERRO.

SELLER<br /><br />constitute the germplasm of a given population of plants is described by the<br />term genetic diversity. The transient evolutionary history of Helianthus (sunflower) has sequentially coupled natural selection pressures from the environment (natural introgression, geographical isolation) with artifical selection (disruptive selection with ethnological isolation ) for early domestication<br />and subsequent modernization of genotypes adapted for cultivation.<br />Development of cultivated crops from wild species has resulted in individual plants being selected over many years by early agriculturalists on the basis<br />of reproductive potential, adaptation, and the preferences of those involved<br />with seed production. Domestication of a crop, thus, produced a smaller<br />number of gene combinations or less genetic diversity than the species as a<br />whole. This has resulted in crops with narrow genetic bases which can be<br />broadened by utilization of wild relatives of cultivated crops. The future competitiveness of the sunflower industry will rely on development of new technology and novel methods to enhance and escalate utilization of wild (unadapted) sunflower germplasm.<br />Wild Helianthus species constitute the basic genetic stock from which cultivated sunflower originated. They have contributed specific characteristics<br />for sunflower improvement (Thompson et al., 198 l, Seiler, 1988a). The genus Helianthus contains 49 species and 19 subspecies, with 12 annual and 37<br />perennial species ( i i ~ i ~ et al., 1n,~o.<br />. . . . S,.hflhng<br />,. • • an,,-, Heiser, 1981 ). All species<br />are native to North America supposedly originating in the southwest to central United States. The diverse species are adapted to a wide diversity of habitats and possess considerable variability for most economic and agronomic<br />characteristics, insect and disease resistance and seed quality factors<br />(Thompson et al., 1981; Rogers et al., 1982). The use of wild species in<br />breeding programs has the potential for markedly improving commercial hybrid sunflower production (Thompson et al., 1981; Dorrell and Whalen, 1978;<br />Laferriere, 1986). This is especially important today because the expanded<br />production of sunflower worldwide is subjecting the crop to intensified disease and insect problems and extremes in environmental conditions. Hence,<br />there is a need for greater genetic variability providing additional sources of<br />resistance to diseases and insects, and seed quality characteristics among<br />modern cultivated sunflower.<br />Cultivated hybrid sunflower utilizes an extremely narrow genetic base,<br />mainly the male sterile cytoplasm derived from the wild species H. petiolaris<br />(Leclercq, 1969 ). This extremely narrow genetic base has left the cultivated<br />sunflower crop potentially vulnerable to disasters such as was seen with the<br />southern corn leaf blight epidemic of 1970 (Tatum, 1971 ). Genetic variability in the cultivated sunflower may be increased by crossing it with the numerous wild Helianthus species.<br />This paper will discuss the genetic diversity available in the genus Helianthus relative to the following subjects: taxonomy and classification; explora-<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />| 97<br /><br />tion and germplasm collection; interspecific hybridization; cytoplasmic male<br />sterility; diseases; insects; oil and seed quality; and agronomic traits.<br />TAXONOMYAND CLASSIFICATION<br />The genus Helianthus has been described to contain as few as ten species to<br />more than 200. Heiser et al. (1969) recognized 12 annual species and 36<br />perennial species in three sections and seven series. The taxonomic classification by Anashchenko ( 1974, 1979) was a radical departure from all previous ones. He recognized only one annual species, H. annuus (with three<br />subspecies and six varieties) and only nine perennial species (with 13 subspecies). Schilling and Heiser ( 1981 ) proposed an infrageneric classification<br />of Helianthus using phenetic, cladistic and biosystematic procedures resulting in 49 species of Helianthus placed in four sections and six series (Table<br />1 ). The variability of the taxa in the genus make it difficult to rigorously identify and classify taxa.<br />Although an infrageneric classification of Helianthus has already been proposed using complementary methods of biosystematics, uncertainties about<br />the phylogenetic relationships of some species remain unresolved, preventing<br />their rigorous classification. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and isozyme data<br />have been used to reconstruct the evoluntionary history of 2 ! taxa comprising<br />the annual species ofHelianthus (Rieseberg et al., 1991 ). Low levels ofcpDNA<br />and isozyme divergence suggest a recent origin for the annual species,, perhaps<br />within the last 1-2 million years, with subsequent rapid evolution and diversification throughout North America. Spring and Schilling (1989) examined<br />the chemosystematics of the annual species of Helianthus using sesquiterpene<br />lactones (STLs). The STL profiles of two annual species, H. agrestis and H.<br />porteri, exhibited significant differences relative to any other species of the<br />annual sections of Helianthus, which supports their exclusion from the section. Phylogenvtic history of wild sunflower species serves as a useful reference for breeders attempting to utilize the wild species in their sunflower improvement programs.<br />Species of Helianthus have been variously defined. Part of the confusion<br />has arisen because of different ploidy levels of several spe,:;e~ w~-:ch make it<br />difficult for taxonomists to define ""pure"" species. While introgression and<br />hybridization make identifying and classifying species of the genus difficult,<br />this genetic diversity is important as a potential source of genes for the improvement of cultivated sunflower.<br />EXPLORATION<br /><br />Explorations to locate and collect wild sunflower species represent one of<br />the more difficult and challenging phases in the process of conserving genetic<br /><br />G.J.

Helianthus is one of the<br />few crop genera with wild relatives (species) that are native to North America and, more specifically, to the southwestern United States. Having the wild<br />progenitors of sunflower within the boundaries of the United States has facilitated explorations to collect and preserve germplasm of wild sunflower<br />species.<br />Several researchers have traveled the equivalent of several times around<br />the world in search of wild sunflower species. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Board for Plant<br />Genetic Resources (IBPGR), European Cooperative Program for Genetic<br />Resources (ECP/GR) have participated in several of the more recent explorations in the United States. The germplasm collection contains seeds or<br />rootstocks from some populations of all known species and subspecies, but<br />does not contain, in most cases, an adequate number of populations of several<br />species to have a good cross-section of the genetic diversity available.<br />GERMPLASM COLLECTION<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) established a wild sunflower species collection at Bushland, Texas in 1976. The objective of the program was to establish a wild<br />sunflower germplasm collection with as many accessions of the known wild<br />species as possible and practical. The decision to create a permanent wild<br />species collection greatly increased the number of plant explorations for wild<br />sunflower species populations. Through the collection efforts of several researchers, an excellent wild sunflower germplasm collection has been assembled. The entire collection now contains over 2000 accession nurober~ (Seller,<br />1987, 1988b). The active collection contains approximately 1000 annual and<br />500 perennial accessions. Since 1976, 4200 accessions of wild sunflower have<br />been distributed to 30 different countries from the germplasm collection at<br />Bushland, Texas (Seiler, 1984a). The wild species accessions distributed have<br />become the basis of several wild species collections throughout the world<br />(IBPGR, 1985 ). Most notable is the collection at the Institute of Field and<br />Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad, Yugoslavia ( IBPGR, 1984; Cuk and Seiler, 1985 ),<br />which contains 39 of the 50 wild sunflower species.<br />There is little doubt that additional populations of several species should<br />be collected to increase the genetic diversity available in the wild sunflower<br />germplasm collection. One factor to consider is the amount of time and effort<br />needed to maintain the populations for future use. Almost 70% of the wild<br />species are perennial and a substantial effort is required to maintain these<br />population accessions. The present USDA-ARS sunflower collection is located at the National Plant Germplasm Plant Introduction Station at Ames,<br /><br />200<br /><br />G.J.

The price to collect and maintain germplasm is high; but once the germplasm is collected it is priceless!<br />Genetic diversity in the genus Helianthus is reflected by habitat diversity<br />among the species (Table 2). Dry, sandy soils are inhabited by such species<br />as H. anomalus, H. deserticola, H. neglectus and H. niveus ssp. niveus, while<br />very moist soils are inhabited by H. angustifolius, H. agrestis, H. californicus,<br />H. giganteus, H. nuttallii ssp. nuttallii, H. paradoxus and H. tuberosus. Wild<br />sunflower species are distributed from deep woods (H. decapetalus) to those<br />species which occupy the prairies (H. pauciflorus ssp. subrhomboideus, H.<br />maximiliani and H. grosseserratus). Some species inhabit moist, heavy and<br />very saline soils. One annual species, H. paradoxus, has a high tolerance for<br />salt and has great potential as a source of genes for salt tolerance in cult':rated<br />sunflower (Seiler et al., 1981; Chandler and Jan, 1984).<br />The diverse habitats which wild sunflower species inhabit are reflections of<br />the genetic variability present in the various populations within the species.<br /><br />202<br /><br />G.J. SELLER<br /><br />Knowledge of a particular habitat and adaptation of the species often help<br />identify potential sources of desirable genes for specific traits. The recent release of six Plasmapara halstedii (Farl.) Berl. &amp; de Toni (downy mildew)<br />resistant (Race 4) lines illustrate this point (Miller and Gulya, 1988 ). The<br />released germplasms consisted of two lines from wild H. annuus, three from<br />wild H. praecox ssp. runyonii and one from H. argophyllus. Interestingly, all<br />the species populations occurred within 20 to 30 km of Corpus Christi, Texas,<br />which is located on the Texas coast of the Gulf of Mexico. This area is favorable for the natural occurrence of downy mildew and it appears that at least<br />some local populations of the wild species have developed a resistance to the<br />disease. Jan and Chandler (1985) studied the transfer of Erysiphe cichoracearurn DC. (powdery mildew) resistance from Helianthus debilis ssp. debilis. The original wild population came from the Atlantic coastal area (Hutchinson Island) of Florida. Aga;m, this habitat is ideal for the natural occurrence<br />of the disease and a source of resistance was found in the wild species from<br />that area.<br />It is important to learn as much as possible about the distribution and variability of wild sunflower species. This knowledge will be useful in the future<br />when specific characteristics are sought for improvement of cultivated sunflower. Based on geographic location and immediate environment, selection<br />of potential species for a particular characteristic may become easier, more<br />efficient and accurate.<br /><br />INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION<br /><br />Much success has been achieved in recent years in hybridizing different<br />species of plants by using newer breeding techniques. The genus Helianthus<br />offers a prime example of the potential that these methods hold for plant<br />breeders and serves to illustrate the importance of the preservation of wild<br />germplasm as a source of genetic variability for the future (Laferriere, 1986).<br />The use of wild species in sunflower breeding programs is frequently obstructed by incompatibility, genetic distance and increased chromosome<br />numbers and aberrations in tetra- and hexaploid species. Many of the species<br />hybridize readily with one another in nature and in cultivation (Heiser et al.,<br />1969; Heiser, 1976). Helianthus annuus crosses mos! easily with other diploid annuals and less easily with the polyploid-perennial species (GeorgievaTodorova, 1984, 1985). During diploid-polyploid interspecific hybridization, it is uncertain whether elimination of a genome or genomes occurs which<br />may carry desirable genes. Since there is insufficient knowledge of genetic<br />structure in the species of the genus Helianthus, it is advisable to screen wild<br />species for disease resistance and to study their chromosomal and genomic<br />structure simultaneously (Skoric, 1987 ).<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />203<br /><br />•'shchenko ( 1982 ) reported that there appear to be three primary genomes .a Helianthus, all of which have the base chromosome number x = 17.<br />According to Anashchenko (1982), Genome A is native to the southern Appalachians of the United States and is characteristic of most of the North<br />American perennial sunflowers. Genome B is native to the Rocky Mountains<br />of the United States and is characterized by annual sunflowers. Genome C is<br />also native to the Rockies of the United States and is characterized by western<br />perennial species, H. ciliaris and H. pumilus. Some of the polyploid species<br />contain various combinations of these three basic genomes. There also is some<br />evidence that the three primary genomes may be the result of some very ancient polyploidy (Heiser and Smith, 1955; Jackson and Murray, 1983).<br />Among the annual sunflower, H. debilis appears to have the chromosomal<br />configuration most nearly resembling the ancestral condition. Helianthus annuus and H. neglectus are the most highly differentiated (Chandler et al.,<br />1986).<br />Controlled interspecific hybridization of Helianthus has been conducted<br />for many years and early interests of Soviet breeders were to obtain resistance<br />to insect and disease pests (Whalen, 1978). Attempts at using interspecific<br />hybridization in sunflower breeding date back to 1916, when the Soviet scientist Sazyperow first used interspecific hybrids between iI. annuus and H.<br />argophyllus in an attempt to develop cultivated H. annuus with rust resistance<br />(Cockerell, 1929). The early interest in interspecific hybridization of Helianthus species in North America was more theoretical and better suited for taxonomic research than agronomic applications. Leclercq (1969) reported cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in backcross progeny of the hybrid H.<br />petiolaris×H, annuus. Today, researchers in many countries have shown a<br />renewed interest in interspecific hybridization for insect and disease resistance and for additional sources of CMS and fertility restoration.<br />Interspecific crosses among the wild species of Helianthus have been reviewed by Whalen ( 1978 ). Intcrspecific hybridization has been used to facilitate the use of wild species for agronomic purposes. Whalen (1976) used<br />wild H. annuus as an ""intermediate"" parent or ""bridge"" to produce hybrids<br />with both H. giganteus and H. maximiiiani. Direct hybridization between the<br />cultivar 'Krasnodarets' and H. giganteus produced a single, highly sterile hybrid. Continued backcrossing with commercial cultivars has yielded apparent<br />CMS segregants from both the H. giganteus and H. maximiliani cytoplasms<br />(Whalen, 1980; Whalen and Dedio, 1980).<br />Conventional crossing methods have produced many interspecific hybrids<br />between cultivated sunflower and some of the wild species, especially the diploid annuals. However, several of the wild species, especially the diploid perennials, remain untapped as usable germplasm for agronomic purposes because many have not been hybridized with cultivated sunflower. Abortion of<br />the hybrid embryo is one mechanism that prevents hybridization of these per-<br /><br />204<br /><br />GJ.SELLER<br /><br />ennials (Chandler and Beard, 1978). The classical solution to this problem<br />in other crops has been the use of embryo culture, i.e. excising the embryo<br />before it aborts and placing it on nutrient media to grow in vitro into a seedling capable of supporting itself. Whalen (1976) had limited success with embryo culture of interspecific sunflower hybrids.<br />Chandler and Beard (1983) successfully made 53 in~crspecific Helianthus<br />combinations using an embryo culture system. Twenty-one of these combinations had not previously produced progeny using conventional methods.<br />The lack of fertilization in some of the attempted crosses presents a serious<br />barrier to hybridization, but such infertility can potentially be ~wercome by<br />using different population accessions within a particular species. Different<br />population accessions of a species have been shown to have variability in pollen staining, indicating varyiug degrees of potential pollen fertility (Seiler,<br />1984c; Atlagic, 1990).<br />Another problem reported in conventional interspecific ~ybridization is<br />dormancy of hybrid seed. Well-developed hybrid seeds fr~.~ some crosses have<br />been obtained that would not germinate (Heiser et al., 1969). This dormancy<br />is strongest in the annual desert species, e.g.H, anomalus, H. deserticola and<br />H. niveus ssp. tephrodes, which are potential germplasm sources of drought<br />tolerance (Chandler and Jan, 1985). In interspecific hybrids, embryo culture<br />sometimes avoids the embryo dormancy barrier. Embryo culture also may be<br />useful in certain programs by increasing the number of generations per year.<br />Embryos resulting from some crosses between annual species and cultivated<br />sunflower develop quickly. Shortened generation times also may be useful in<br />breeding projects where only a few plants are needed per generation, such as<br />transferring fertile inbred line characteristics into sterile cytoplasm or backcrossing a desirable gene into an inbred line.<br />Utilization of many species of wild Helianthus is limited by poor crossability and the high degree of F~ sterility in interspecific hybrids. Doubling the<br />chromosome number of one or both parents has improved interspecific crossability in some crops (Dewey, 1980). Chromosome doubling of interspecific<br />hybrids generally is effective in improving fertility when sterility is associated<br />with meiotic abnormalities in sunflower (Jan et al., 1983). Chromosome<br />doubling by applying colchicine to apical meristems of young seedlings has<br />been demonstrated in cultivated sunflower (Dhesi and Saini, 1973; Gupta<br />and Roy, 1979; Downes and Marshall, 1983). Also, chromosome doubling of<br />diploid perennial species and their interspecific hybrids has been reported by<br />Heiser and Smith (1964) and Jackson and Murray (1983). Chromosome<br />doubling of cultivated × wild diploid interspecific hybrids was reported by Jan<br />et al. (1983) and Jan and Chandler (1988). The use of chromosome doubling may be even more dramatic for the more difficult interspecific hybrids<br />with near-zero pollen viability. The use of chromosome doubling to increase<br />fertility of interspecifie hybrids, its consequences on chromosome constitu-<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENTOF CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />205<br /><br />tions of backcross progenies and its practical value in interspecific gene transfer needs further clarification, but chromosome doubling appears to be a potentially useful technique for overcoming low fertility in F~ interspecific<br />hybrids.<br />CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILITY<br /><br />Cytoplasmic male sterility is a maternally inherited trait preventing plants<br />from producing normal pollen. Cytoplasmic male sterility is used as a tool to<br />generate F~ hybrid seed in maize, rice, sorghum and sunflower. Alloplasmic<br />male sterility (arising from interspecific or intergeneric crosses) is thought to<br />be due to incompatibility between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Pearson,<br />1981).<br />Another use for interspecific hybridization is in the creation of male sterile<br />parents for hybrids. This has revolutionized the sunflower industry by making possible the production of high~uality hybrid sunflower. Leclercq ( 1969 )<br />reported stable CMS in sunflower based on H. petiolaris. Kinman (1970)<br />obtained the CMS source of Leclercq and discovered genetic fertility-restoring genes in lines that were also derived from wild species. Enns et al. (1970),<br />Leclercq (1971), Vranceanu and Stonescu (1971, 1973, 1978) and Fick et<br />al. (1974) also subsequently reported fertility-restoring genes. The first hybrids produced by this system were made available for commercial production in the United States in 1972 and by 1976 over 80% of the sunflower<br />production area in the United States was attributed to these hybrids (Miller,<br />1987).<br />Development of the CMS hybrid system has greatly facilitated the use of<br />wild sunflower species in breeding programs by allowing the hybridization of<br />genetically distant species and the subsequent incorporation of specific characteristics for the improvement of cultivated sunflower. Because the cuRirated sunflower hybrids are presently based on one cytoplasm ( = French,<br />PET 1 ), they are extremely vulnerable to an impending disaster.<br />The search for additional new sources of CMS continues. Since the present<br />cytoplasm of cultivated sunflower was found in a wild species, it is not surprising that other potential cytoplasms have been identified from them (Table 3). Serieys (1987) also reported an unstable C ~ S from H. niveus ssp.<br />canescens and he speculated that the instability was due to segregating progenies, likely due to unfixed female plants with complementary restoration systems in an unstable cytoplasm.<br />Fertility restoration can often be a problem in the development of new CMS.<br />The gene in the parent with CMS often is termed a fertility factor gene rather<br />than a restoration gene. Partial restoration of fertility has been observed in<br />many parents with CMS, indicating the presence of modifying genes that often<br />are greatly influenced by the environment making their inheritance difficult<br /><br />2O6<br /><br />G.J.

Several sources o f restorer genes for PETI (CMS<br />HA89 H . p e t i o l a r i s c y t o p l a s m ) have been identified from the wild species<br />(Skoric et al., 1988 ). T h e frequency o f the restorer genes was m u c h higher in<br />the annual species than the perennial species. Restorer genes were also m o r e<br />frequent in the heterozygous state t h a n the homozygous state. In most cases,<br />the n u m b e r o f genes controlling fertility restoration has not been determined.<br />The classical m e t h o d for differentiating cytoplasm sources has been the reaction for the restoration o f male fertility by various inbred lines crossed with<br />a suspected source o f C M S (Leclercq, 1983, 1984). O t h e r m e t h o d s for distinguishing between CMS sources are becoming available. With the advent o f<br />molecular techniques permitting direct examination o f cytoplasmic genomes,<br />cytoplasms can now be further differentiated (Leroy et al., 1985 ). Two cytoplasms with indistinguishable inbred line reactions from given restorer genes<br />can be distinguished if their cytoplasmic genomes exhibit restriction site heterogenity. Evidence suggests that m i t r o c h o n d r i a are carriers o f genetic determ i n a n t s conditioning CMS in plants (Leroy et al., 1985; Brown et al., 1986;<br />Perez et al., 1986; Crouzillat et al., 1987, 1988a,b, 1991; Siculella and Palmer,<br />1988 ). Mitochondrial plasmids have been suggested as a means to distinguish<br />between cytoplasms and wild species (Crouzillat et al., 1988a,b; Perez and<br />Berville, 1988; Perez et al., 1988). The CMS phenotype does not appear to<br />alter the physical m a p o f m i t o c h o n d r i a o f a sunflower species and the evolution o f the mitochondrial D N A structure appears to be independent o f the<br />nuclear e n v i r o n m e n t .<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />207<br /><br />Future improvements of cultivated sunflower through hybridization with<br />new sources of CMS and through introgression of characters of agricultural<br />interest (resistance to frost, drought, natural predators) from wild species of<br />Helianthus into cultivated lines will require extensive knowledge of the genetic properties of the species. Genetic diversity within species, particularly<br />those used for the production of CMS for hybrids, is an important factor for<br />obtaining diverse CMS.<br />DISEASES<br />Diseases are still a limiting factor to high productivity in the majority of<br />sunflower-growing countries. Cultivated sunflower lacks acceptable levels of<br />resistance for the majority of sunflower diseases. Genetic variability of cultivated sunflower may be increased by crossing it with the numerous wild Helianthus species as potential sources of genes for disease resistance.<br />Wild species have been the source of genes for disease resistance. According<br />to Putt and Sackston (1963), rust (Puccinia helianthi Schw.) was the first<br />disease to be genetically controlled by resistance genes RI and R2 incorporated from wild H. annuus. Wild H. annuus and H. petiolaris contain a vast<br />reservoir of rust resistance genes that can be used to broaden the rust protection of domestic cultivars (Hennessy and Sackston, 1972; Zimmer and Rehder, 1976; Thompson et al., 1978). Resistance to races l, 2, 3 and 4 was tbund<br />in &gt; 40% of plants from accessions of wild H. annuus, 1t. argophyllus and H.<br />petiolaris (Quresh et al., 1989 ). This resistance has been transferred to cultivated sunflower lines (Quresh et al., 1990). Rust resistance appears to be<br />common in wild sunflowers (Table 4) (Fick et al., 1974). Wild annual Helianthus provides a sanctuary for the rust fungus in the absence of susceptible<br />cultivars (Zimmer and Hoes, 1978). Studies on wild annual sunflowers suggest that many races of rust occur, with the number of races limited only by<br />the number of differentials used. Rust can be effectively controlled on sunflower for long periods oftime through the use of specific genes for resistance,<br />especially because a free-breeding rust population exists on wild sunflowers.<br />Puccinia helianthi is confined to the genus Helianthus, where it occurs on<br />mcr2 than 35 annual and perennial species (Arthur and Cummins, 1962;<br />Hennessy and Sackston, 1972; Zimmer and Fick, 1974; Zimmer and Rehder,<br />1976). Wild populations of annual sunflower contain some rust-resistant<br />plants (Hennessy and Sackston, 1972; Zimmer and Rehder, i '916 ), but completely resistant or totally susceptible populations rarely are found (Quresh<br />et al., 1989).<br />Sunflower downy mildew (Plasmopara halstedii) is considered a major<br />disease and has economic importance in the United States, Canada and European countries (Sackston, 198 l b). At present eight races of downy mildew<br />have been reported. Resistance to downy mildew in cultivated sunflower is<br /><br />208<br /><br />G.J.

Wild Helianthus has served as a source of downy-mildew-resistance genes (Table 4).<br />Helianthus praecox ssp. runyonii, H. praecox ssp. hirtus, H. argophyllus and<br />18 wild H. annuus entries are resistant to race 2 of downy mildew (Thompson<br />et al., 1978 ). Further testing has shown that these species also are resistant to<br />races 3 and 4 (Miller and Gulya, 1988 ). The resistance in some of the species<br />may be due to the PL2 gene. Some of the resistant species were collected in<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT C~FCULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />209<br /><br />Texas, where the PL2-resistant materials were originally found (Zimmer and<br />Kinman, 1972 ). According to Fick et al. (1974), resistance to race 2 is common among five perennial species (Table 4).<br />The ""group immunity"" cultivars developed by Pustovoit et al. (1976) from<br />interspecific crosses of H. annuus and H. tuberosus were resistant to downy<br />mildew in Europe, but the identity of resistance genes was unknown. Two<br />varieties were derived from this material and released as 'Progress"" and 'N~vinka' (Pustovoit et al., 1976). Recently, Miller and Gulya (1987) showed<br />that these two open-pollinated varieties had the PL5 gene that imparted resistance to races 2 and 3 of downy mildew.<br />Verticillium wilt ( Verticillium dahliae Klebahn) is an important disease in<br />sunflower. Resistance to Verticillium wilt is widespread in wild sunflower<br />(Table 4). Helianthus annuus collected from Manitoba and Saskatchewan,<br />Canada and North Dakota generally are less resistant to 1/"".dahliae than those<br />collected from more southern latitudes (i.e., Colorado and Kansas). Helianthus petiolaris generally is more resistant than H. annuus. Populations of H.<br />annuus from the Central and Southern Great Plains, coinciding with the hypothetical center of origin of H. annuus and H. petiolaris, appear to have relatively higher levels of resistance to V. dahliae (Hoes et al., 1973 ). Putt ( 1964 )<br />discovered a source of genetic resistance to Verticillium alboatrum Reinke &amp;<br />Berth. in line CM 144, which is derived from an interspecific hybrid with wild<br />H. annuus. Pustovoit et al. (1976) reported that H. tomentosus ( = H . resinosus) is resistant to Verticillium wilt.<br />Alternaria leaf spot [ (Alternaria helianthi (Hansf.) Tubaki &amp; Nishihara) ]<br />has been reported from sunflower in both the United States and other parts<br />o f the world ( Sackston, 1981 a ). Morris et al. ( 1983 ) tested 21 annual and 37<br />perennial taxa of Helianthus for resistance to Alternaria helianthi under<br />greenhouse conditions. Only three perennial species were moderately resistant (Table 4). All 21 ~ n u a l species tested were very susceptible. Helianthus<br />tuberosus and H. hirs~;tus showed high levels of resistance to Alternaria under<br />field tests in Yugoslavia (Dragan Skoric, pers. commun., 1986). Although<br />some potential sources of resistance to this disease have been identified, it<br />remains to be determined whether the resistance genes can be transferred to<br />cultivated lines with high combining ability.<br />Powdery mildew (Erysiphe cichoracearum) is a widely distributed pathogen of cultivated sunflower in warmer regions of the world (Zimmer and Hoes,<br />1978). Saliman et al. (1982) found some annual species and 14 perennial<br />species were tolerant to powdery mildew in both field and greenhouse tests<br />(Table 5). Some populations of the perennial species H. grosseserratus and<br />H. maximiliani were resistant, but others were not. These results indicate that<br />several populations of a species may need to be tested to detect genes for resistance in a species. Jan and Chandler (1985) identified a source of resistance to powdery mildew in the wild H. debilis ssp. debilis, which they later<br /><br />210<br /><br />G.J.

Resistance was incompletely dominant<br />in the F~ and backcross progenies. This source of disease resistance may enable the production o f resistant hybrid cultivars suitable for warm, humid<br />climates.<br />Rhizopus head rot ( R h i z o p u s o r y z a e Went. &amp; Prinsen Geerligs) has become an important disease of sunflower in the United States (Rogers et al.,<br />1978 ). Only four of 32 native H e l i a n t h u s species evaluated for resistance using the insertion inoculation method were moderately resistant to R. o r y z a e<br />(Yang et al., 1980) (Table 5). These four species may be good sources of<br />R h i z o p u s resistance in hybrids, however, interspecific crossing will be required to determine how many genes condition resistance (Yang, 1981 ).<br />O r o b a n c h e c u m a n a WaUr. (broomrape) is a seed-producing root parasite<br />of cultivated sunflower in several countries (Cubero, 1986). Most sources of<br />genetic resistance to this parasite were derived from wild H. t u b e r o s u s . Pustovoit et al. (1976) have developed several varieties based on H . t u b e r o s u s<br />which are resistant to several races of broomrape. Broomrape can be an important parasite in some of the drier areas, such as Turkey.<br />P h o r n o p s i s / D i a p o r t h e h e l i a n t h i Munt. Cvet. (stem canker) is one of the<br />most widely distributed diseases of cultivated sunflower (Skoric, 1985 ). This<br /><br />UTILIZATIONOFWILDSUNFLOWERFORIMPROVEMENTOFCULTIVATEDSUNFLOWER<br /><br />211<br /><br />disease is now prevalent in Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, France, Brazil,<br />Argentina and Australia (Mihaljcevic et al., 1980; Skoric, 1985). Skoric<br />(1982) reported a high degree of susceptibility to stem canker in all hybrids<br />and in most varieties. Cuk (1982) reported that some wild sunflower species<br />were free of Phomopsis/Diaporthe helianthi and indicated that these species<br />were potential sources of resistance to the pathogen (Table 6). Four lines<br />tolerant to stem canker were identified (two based on H. tuberosus, one on<br />H. annuus and one on H. argophyllus) (Skoric, 1985). Two population accessions ofH. tuberosus were also rated resistant to stem canker by Dozer (1990).<br />Other wild species that are potential sources of resistance are H. debilis and<br />H. pauciflorus (Cuk, 1982). Hybrids based on the H. tuberosus and H. argophyllus species have been developed and have a high field-tolerance to stem<br />canker (Skoric, 1985 ). Resistance to stem canker is positively correlated with<br />resistance to Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid, Phoma macdonaldi<br />TABLE 6<br />Potential wild Helianthus sources o f disease resistance for Phomopsis/Diaporthe helianthi (brown<br />stem canker) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia wilt)<br />Disease<br /><br />Potential source<br /><br />Brown stem canker b<br /><br />H. annuus (A) a<br />H. argophyllus ( A )<br />H. debilis (A)<br />H. hirsutus (P)<br />H. pauciflorus ssp. pauciflorus (P )<br />H. resinosus (P)<br />H. salicifolius ( P )<br />H. tuberosus (P)<br /><br />Sclerotinia wilt<br />Stem c<br /><br />Root d<br /><br />Head e<br /><br />H. laevigatus (P)<br />H. mollis (P)<br />H. resinosus ( P )<br />H. rigidus (P)<br />H. salicifolius ( P )<br />H. giganteus (P)<br />H. mollis (P)<br />H. nuttallii (P)<br />H. resinosus (P)<br />H. tuberosus (P)<br />H. pauciflorusssp. pauciflorus (P )<br /><br />aA = annual, P = perennial.<br />bSources: Cuk, 1982; Skoric 1982, 1985; Dozet, 1990.<br />cSources: Serieys, 1987; Skoric, 1987.<br />dSource: Skoric, 1987.<br />eSource: Pustovoit and Gubin, 1974.<br /><br />212<br /><br />G.J.SELLER<br /><br />Boerma and drought (Skoric, 1985). It remains to be determined whether<br />these resistances are controlled by linked genes.<br />Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a major pathogen of sunflower<br />that causes roots, stems and heads to rot or wilt (Zimmer and Hoes, 1978 ).<br />The pathogen causes root rot and wilt in wild H. annuus (Edmunds, 1964)<br />and crown rot of//. tuberosus (Bisby, 1924 ). Genetic resistance to Sclerotinia<br />is vitally needed in North America and in Europe (Orellana, 1975 ). Thompson et al. ( 1978 ) found that most of several hundred accessions of wild Helianthus from the United States and Canada were highly susceptible ( &gt; 90%<br />infected plants), but some were moderately resistant (70-79% infected) to<br />~'lerotinia under greenhouse conditions. Thompson et al. (1978) felt that<br />annual species (especially H. annuus) may be the best source of resistance;<br />however, Skoric (1987) found the wild annual species to be more sensitive<br />to the Sclerotinia root rot than the wild perennials. Resistance to S. sclerotiorum head rot has been previously reported in some species of wild Helianthus (e.g.H. tuberosus and H. pauciflorus) and interspecific hybrid~ (Pustovoit and Gubin, 1974; Pustovoit et al., 1976) (Table 6). A high degree of<br />resistance was not, however, found in accessions of H. tuberosus and H. pauciflorus evaluated by Thompson et al. (1978). Serieys ( 1987 ) reported that<br />stem rot resistance was greater in the wild perennial species H. resinosus and<br />H. pauciflorus than in the annual species.<br />The Sclerotinia disease complex appears to be very complicated. The focus<br />on utilizing wild sunflowers for resistance to this disease has not proven successful and the prospect of finding a single dominant gene for resistance is not<br />promising at present. Interspecific hybrids tested for Sclerotinia root rot indicate that it is possible to select genotypes with increased tolerance, especially if selection is sta~ed in early generations ofselfing (Skoric, 1987 ). Population screeniag efforts have not yet been exhausted, however and resistance<br />to Sclerotina may yet be discovered among populations that have demonstrated tolerance in preliminary evaluations.<br />INSECTS<br />One problem with incorporating pest resistance into crop plants is that the<br />pests represent living, evolving populations. That makes the plant breeder's<br />job a never-ending battle. Wild species of Helianthus are attacked by many<br />species of pests in their natural environments, pests which might also mutate<br />into biotypes which could attack the domesticated sunflower. Such a transition in pest status of species from scattered wild populations to domesticated<br />monocultures would greatly enhance the immediate biological fitness of the<br />pest species, causing great increases in pest population density. New pests can<br />arise from seemingly innocuous species or old pests can mutate into virulent<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATEDSUNFLOWER<br /><br />213<br /><br />new biotypes capable of decimating genotypes of sunflower that once were<br />resistant.<br />Because wild sunflowers are native to the United States, their associated<br />insect herbivores and their entomophages coevolved in natural communities<br />that often exist in noncultivatcd fields of sunflower. The long association of<br />wild sunflower and insects in the United States has resulted in hundreds of<br />species of insects that frequent the plants (Cockerell, 1914; Robertson, 1922;<br />Satterthwait, 1946; Charlet, 1983). Fortunately, most species of insects associated with sunflower are either innocuous or benefactors of the plants and<br />relationships range from obligatory to purely casual and nonessential (McGregor, 1976). However, pest problems on sunflower have been more acute<br />in the United States than elsewhere due to natural coevolutionary associations of sunflower with its natural herbivores.<br />When screening wild sunflower species as potential sources of genes for insect resistance, it should be realized that not all plants from one population<br />of a species may exhibit identical levels of resistance to a given pest, but may<br />be segregating for insect resistance. It is important to consider more than one<br />population of a species in determining whether resistance genes can be obtained from that species. Also, insect infestation in a particular population of<br />wild sunflower under natural conditions can be variable, which complicates<br />the interpretation of the mechanism of resistance genes in the population.<br />Until recently, very little attention has been given to the development of<br />insect-resistant sunflower germplasm by utilizing the wild sunflower species<br />(Rogers and Thompson, 1978a). Several species of Lepidoptera use sunflower as a host and attack cultivated sunflower (Rogers, 1988; Charlet et al.,<br />1987). Kinman (1966) and Teetes et al. ( 1971 ) reported tentative resistance<br />and/or differing degrees of susceptibility to larvae of the sunflower moth<br />[Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst)] in H. petiolaris and among commercial<br />varieties. Several sources of potential resistance to sunflower moth have been<br />identified in the wild species (Table 7). Interspecific germplasms based on<br />wild H. tuberosus and H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris have been developed and<br />released for sunflower moth resistance (Rogers et al., 1984).<br />The three released germplasms have a phytomelanin layer which becomes<br />extremely dense after its deposition in the pericarp, making the achenes with<br />this characteristic more resistant to mechanical puncture by larvae at an earlier stage of development (Stafford et al., 1984). The hardened pericarp is<br />thought to protect achenes from damage by younger sunflower moth larvae.<br />All species of Helianthus have phytomelanin in pericarps, although the characteristic does not appear to be present in all populations of a species (Seller<br />et al., 1984).<br />The Curculionids, as a group, have been the most economically damaging<br />insect pests of cultivated sunflower in the Central and Northern Great Plains<br />states of the United States (Charlet et al., 1987).

A stem weevil, Cylindrocopturus adspersus<br />(LeConte), has been a particularly troublesome pest of cultivated sunflower<br />wher~ever the crop is gsown west of the Mississippi River (Phillips et al., 1973;<br />Rogers et al., 1983). Twenty-four species of Helianthus (11 annual and 13<br />perennial) have significant levels of resistance to C. adspersus female oviposition and/or larval development (Table 7). Hence, the use of host resistance<br />through germplasm derived from wild sunflower species holds considerable<br /><br />UTILIZA'HON OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATEDSUNFLOWER<br /><br />215<br /><br />promise as an enduring, efficient management strategy for stem weevil control in cultivated sunflower.<br />The sunflower beetle, Zygogramma exclamatignis (Fabricius), has long<br />been recognized as an important defoliator of sunflower in the Northern Plains<br />of the United States (Charlet et al., 1987) but not a serious pest in the Southern Plains (Rogers, 1977). In laboratory studies, about one-half of the wild<br />species exhibited resistance to feeding and/or reproduction by the sunflower<br />beetle (Rogers and Thompson, ! 978c, 1980). Antibiosis against both !~rvae<br />and adult beetles was strongly expressed, particularly by the perennial Helianthus species (Table 7). It appears that incorporation of germplasm from Helianthus species in sunflower has merit as a management strategy for the sunflower beetle and other coleopterous pests.<br />Several other insect species attack cultivated sunflower, but are not of great<br />economic concern. The carrot beetle Bothynus gibbosus (DeGeer) is a potential pest of sunflower. Laboratory and greenhouse studies showed that about<br />one-half of the wild Helianthus species are resistant to carrot beetle injury<br />(Rogers and Thompson, 1978b). In field tests, beetles feeding on roots of<br />selected perennial species suffered acute mortality in no-choice feeding tests<br />(Rogers et al., 1980). Aphids, Masonaphis masoni (Knowlton) and leafhoppers, Empoasca abrupta (Delong) are sometimes abundant on sunflower.<br />Laboratory and greenhouse studies have shown that several species of Helianthus are resistant to attack by the aphid and the western potato lea~.opper<br />(Rogers and Thompson, 1978d, 1979; Rogers, 1981 ).<br />Many wild species of Helianthus have been identified as sources of resistance to the major insect pests of cultivated sunflower. This resistance has<br />been suggested to have a chemical basis. In in vitro bioassays of non-polar<br />extracts from H. annuus, H. argophyllus, H. ciliaris and H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris caused significant lengthening of larvae stadia and retarded larval<br />growth of sunflower moth (Rogers et al., 1987 ). Sunflower moth larvae feeding on purified sesquiterpene lactones (STL) and diterpenes from H. argophyllus, H. ciliaris, H. angustifolius, and H. mollis experienced high mortality,<br />retarded growth, and an extended developmental period (Rogers et al., 1987).<br />High concentrations of STLs and diterpenes are found in glandular hairs (trichomes) on many wild species of Helianthus and have been shown to be toxins and antifeedants toward some major sunflower insect pests (Gershenzon<br />et al., 1985 ). The STLs isolated from glandular trichomes on anthers of H.<br />maximiliani were shown to be toxic to young sunflower moth larvae in bioassays (Gershenzon and Mabry, 1984 ). Examination of several cultivated lines<br />of sunflower showed lower densities of glandular hairs on the anthers than in<br />the wild species. Thus, increased resistance to sunflower moth predation might<br />be achieved by breeding for an increased density of glandular hairs on floral<br />parts surrounding the pollen.<br />Early attempts to incorporate some of the identified insect-resistance genes<br /><br />216<br /><br />G.J. SELLER<br /><br />from the wild species to cultivated sunflower have not been successful. Transfer of the genes does not appear to be straightforward. Thc problem appears<br />to be that resistance genes may be linked with other genes, or the resistance<br />may be multi-genic. The resistance genes may be lost in the early generations<br />of backcrossing with the cultivated sunflower. Also, due to ~he great genetic<br />distance between some of the wild species (especially the perennial species)<br />and the cultivated sunflower, a considerable number of deleterious genes (in<br />terms of agronomic characteristics) are brought in from the wild species. It is<br />possible that insect-resistance genes are linked to deleterious agronomic genes<br />and are eliminated in the selection process. When techniques are developed<br />to pinpoint insect-resistance genes in the wild species, transfer of the resistance genes to cultivated sunflower will be facilitated because large blocks of<br />unnecessary or deleterious genes will not have to be moved. As these techniques develop, transfer of genes from the wild species will become efficient<br />and increased utilization of wild sunflower species will result.<br />Host resistance in cultivated sunflower via incorporation ofgermplasm from<br />wild Helianthus offers a tremendous potential for long-lasting economical<br />management of several insect pests. For the short term, knowledge of the<br />bionomics of pests on native Helianthus hosts will promote ecologically sound<br />strategies which could be developed for management of insects on cultivated<br />sunflower (Rogers, 1988 ).<br />OIL AND SEED QUALITY<br /><br />Wild sunflower species possess considerable variability for most economic<br />and agronomic characteristics and seed quality factors (Thompson et al.,<br />1981 ). Seed oil content of most wild species has been reported (Fick et al.,<br />1976; Dorrell and Whalen, 1978; Thompson et al., 1978, 1981; Seiler, 1985a).<br />Wild Helianthus accessions generally have lower oil concentration than cultivated sunflower. Helianthus niveus ssp. canescens had the highest oil concentration (402 g k g - ~) among the wild species (Table 8 ). Oil concentration<br />of several native populations ofH. annuus averaged 223 to 303 g kg-~ (Fick<br />et al., 1976; Thompson et al., 1981; Seiler, 1984b). Variability exists in the<br />wild species for oil concentration. While oil concentration is lower in wild<br />species, backcrossing to cultivated lines quickly raises the oil concentration<br />to an acceptable level. Increasing the low oil concentration of the wild species<br />does not appear to be a limiting factor in utilizing them for improvement of<br />cultivated sunflower.<br />Environmental factors, especially temperature during the period of seed<br />development and maturation, affect both the concentration and composition<br />of oil in maturing, cultivated sunflower seed. The effects of temperature on<br />oil concentration, however, are variable (Canvin, 1965; Harris et al., 1978;<br />Robertson et al., 1979; Unger and Thompson, 1982).

Oil<br />concentrations ofH. a n n u u s populations range from 238 to 255 g kg- i. Seeds<br /><br />218<br /><br />G.J. SELLER<br /><br />from seven of 22 perennial species grown at a common location had significantly different seed oil content from seed of the original populations (Seiier,<br />1985b). Very little information is available about the effects of environmental factors on oil content in perennial species. In perennial species, oil content<br />may be under more rigid genetic control or less influenced by environmental<br />factors than in the annuals, at least in the populations evaluated thus far. Pathcoefficient analyses indicated that minimum temperature and total solar radiation have the greatest direct effect on seed oil content in the wild annual<br />sunflower, though the influence is minimal (Seiler, 1986b).<br />Most wild species of Helianthus have been evaluated for fatty acid concentration (Knowles et al., 1970; Femandez-Ma~inez and Knowles, 1976; Dortell and Whalen, 1978; Thompson et al., 1978, 1981; Seile"", 1982, 1983, 1984b,<br />1985a, 1986a). High average linoleic acid concentration ( 720 g kg - ~ of oil)<br />has been reported for several species (Table 8). Several species had one or<br />more populations having linoleic acid concentration above 720 g kg- ~ with a<br />range for the genus from 370 g kg-~ in one population of H. argophyllus to<br />830 g kg- 1 in H. porteri.<br />Oleic acid, another important fatty acid, appears to be quite variable in<br />wild sunflower species. Several species had oleic acid concentrations of 400 g<br />kg-~ and greater (Table 8 ). The lowest oleic acid concentration of the wild<br />species was observed in H. porteri (55 g kg -t ) and H. radula (93 g kg -~ )<br />(Seller, 1985a; Thompson et al., ! 981 ).<br />Seeds of many wild species examined for fatty acid concentration came<br />from plants collected in their native habitats and not from plants grown at a<br />common location. Environmental conditions in various locations where individual accessions were collected may have influenced oleic and linoleic acid<br />concentrations. Fatty acid concentrations of 22 perennial species (one accession each) from the original habitats were compared with these traits in seeds<br />of respective accessions grown at a single location (Bushland, Texas) to determine environmental influences on fatty acid concentrations (Seiler,<br />1985a). Oleic acid concentrations were significantly different for 10 of the 22<br />species examined for the original vs. common environment, while linoleic<br />acid concentrations were significantly different in five of the 22 species. Palmitic acid was not significantly affected by different environments in any species. Stearic acid was significantly affected by different environments in only<br />H. mollis and tt. 9ccidentalis ssp. occidentalis. Undoubtedly, some of this<br />variation was caused by differences in environments at different locations.<br />However, the fact that different individual plants within a species accession<br />at a single location have distinctly different levels of oleic and linoleie acids<br />suggests that the variation may also have a genetic component (Knowles et<br />al., 1970).<br />Multiple regression analysis indicated that day of year, total solar radiation<br />and maximum temperature significantly influenced linoleic acid in H. an-<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CUL'I IVATEDSUNFLOWER<br /><br />219<br /><br />nuus, whereas oleic acid was influenced only ~ the latter two factors (Seiler,<br />1983). Path-coefficient analysis indicated tt',at minimum temperature and<br />solar radiation had the primary influences on o~eic acid concentration in wild<br />annual sunflower and cultivated sunflower, with ma~ximum temperature being<br />less important (Seiler, 1986a). Linoleic acid concentration was primarily influenced (negatively) by minimum temperature and solar radiation in wild<br />annual and cultivated sunflower. The analysis also indicated that wild annual<br />sunflower reacts similarly to cultivated sunflower to the environmental factors examined.<br />Interrelationships among fatty acid concentrations should also be a consideration in sunflower breeding programs. Wild annual sunflower grown at a<br />single location showed a significant positive association ( r = 0.561 ) between<br />palmitic and stearic acid (Seller, 1985b ). This also was seen in the cultivated<br />hybrid '894'. There is a strong negative association (r= -0.989) between oleic<br />and linoleic acid in the wild annual sunflower (Seller, 1985b). Both fatty acids<br />show some association with stearic acid, so the selection for either may affect<br />the level of stearic acid. The association of palmitic acid with linoleic and<br />oleic acid was weak (low). Hence, breeding or selection for these acids should<br />not affect palmitic acid. However, moderate positive association between<br />palmitic and stearic acid indicates that selection for palmitic acid may affect<br />the level of stearic acid and vice versa.<br />The wild species may have the potential of improving chemical composition of cultivated sunflower seed (Laferriere, 1986 ). Protein is one factor of<br />interest if the seeds are to be used for human or livestock consumption. Defatted kernels of H. pauciflorus, for example, are reported to contain 710 g<br />kg- ' protein (Georgieva-Todorova and Hristova, 1975 ). In commercial sunflower meal, protein content is approximately 440 g k g - ' (dehulled) and 280<br />g kg -I (whole seeds) (Doty, 1978). Pustovoit and Krasnokutskaya (1975)<br />reported protein content ranging from 290 to 350 g kg -I in 39 wild species<br />of Helianthus. Seiler (1984d) reported that crude protein in whole seeds<br />ranged as high as 348 g kg -! in H. nuttallii ssp. nuttallii (Table 9). Wholeseed crude protein averaged 180 g k g - ~ in wild H. annuus and 189 g kg- ~ in<br />cultivated sunflower. In other wild Helianthus species (6 perennials and 19<br />annuals), whole-seed crude protein varied from 137 g kg- l in H. neglectus to<br />305 g k g - l in H. porteri (Seller, 1986b). The crude protein of whole seeds of<br />annual species is generally lower than that of perennial species (Seiler, 1984d).<br />Laferriere (1986) suggested that it is possible that the high protein content of<br />seeds of wild species may be due to their smaller size. Sufficient variability<br />exists in the wild Helianthus species to be useful in breeding programs with<br />an objective to increase protein concentration in the seed. In any breeding<br />work for increased protein content, it would be necessary to maintain or improve the balance of essential amino acids. This may be more crucial than<br />increasing the percentage of crude protein.<br /><br />G.J.

While not toxic, chlorogenic acid<br />does make the isolation and preparation of colorless meal difficult. Breeding<br />for an absence or lower levels of this acid could result in eliminating the need<br />for costly extractions of chlorogenic acid. DorreU (1976) evaluated 42 wild<br />H. annuus populations for chlorogenic acid and found a range from 15 g kgto 27 g kg-~, which, on the average, is somewhat lower than the cultivated<br />types. The variability in chlorogenic acid in the wild species is encouraging,<br />but many more species and populations have yet to be evaluated.<br />AGRONOMIC TRAITS<br /><br />A wide variety of agronomic traits has been examined in wild Helianthus<br />species for possible use in improving the hardiness and productivity of cultivated sunflower (Laferriere, 1986). Each wild species population has the potential to contribute germplasm that is different from any other source. Wild<br />H. annuus in different habitats frequently vary in height, anthesis date and<br />other characteristics; but it is not always clear whether these differences reflect genetic effects or phenotypic variations due to environments. Growing<br />the accessions from diverse habitats in a uniform environment enables one to<br />determine genotypic and environmental effects of morphological and agronomic characteristics that are potentially useful.<br /><br />UTILIZATION OF WILD SUNFLOWER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER<br /><br />221<br /><br />Over 200 populations of seven wild species grown at Fargo, ND, USA, exhibited a wide range in height and flowering time, both within and between<br />species (Fick et al., 1974). These populations also exhibited significant differences in seedling vigor, germination, branching, seed shattering and frost<br />tolerance. Beard and Williams (1982) used cluster analysis techniques to determine distinct groups among 177 accessions of wild H. annuus under common environmental conditions at Davis, California. If cluster analyses are<br />meaningful, one or two accessions in each group could be used as parental<br />material to determine the possible germplasm potential of each population.<br />Cluster analysis divided the 177 accessions into 10 groups containing agronomic characteristics of anthesis date, vigor rating (seedling), seed length,<br />weight of 200 seed, oil content and linoleic acid content. Accessions with similar flowering dates were grouped together, allowing the comparison of other<br />agronomic characteristics. For example, two groups which flowered at the<br />same time but had different linoleic acid concentrations indicated that fatty<br />acid differences were due to genetic variability of accessions rather than environmental effects and, therefore, potentially useful in a breeding program.<br />Agronomic and morphological characteristics of 90 populations of wild H.<br />annuus were evaluated at Bushland, Texas (Seiler, 1984b). Agronomic and<br />morphological characteristics examined were: weight per 200 seeds, test<br />weight; flowering date; flowering period; seed oil concentration; fatty acid<br />concentration; head and disk diameter; ray petal length, width and number;<br />bract length, width, and number; leaf length and width; and plant height.<br />Considerable variation existed when wild H. annuus populations from widely<br />separated geographical areas were grown at a common location. Of the nine<br />agronomic characteristics examined, variation in test weight, flowering date,<br />flowering period, seed oil concentration, fatty acid composition and concentration of oil indicate that these characteristics are potentially useful in sunflower breeding programs. Potentially useful morphological characteristics are<br />leaf size, which was comparable in some wild accessions to commercial hybrid '894' and the short plant height of some populations for reduced-height<br />hybrids in cultivated sunflower.<br />Helianthus exilis (serpentine sunflower) is a potential genetic resource in<br />terms of morphological and ecological features and fatty acid composition of<br />oil (Jain et al., 1977). The serpentine sunflower inhabits moist, serpentine<br />soils of the inner coastal range in California. The potential value of H. exilis<br />is the higher linoleic acid content in oil and germination polymorphism related to the response to red/far-red light and low temperature and which may<br />be useful in eliminating dormancy problems (Olivieri and Jain, 1977).<br />Several wild species of Helianthus are native to salt-impacted habitats and<br />may possess genes for salt tolerance. Chandler and Jan (1984) evaluated three<br />wild Helianthus species for saR tolerance: H. paradoxus, H. debilis and an H.<br />annuus population native to salty desert areas. Helianthus debilis tolerated a<br /><br />222<br /><br />G.J. SEILER<br /><br />salt concentration about the same as cultivated sunflower, dying at a NaCI<br />concentration o f 250 to 400 mM. The wild ecotype o f H . annuus had a higher<br />tolerance, with some plants surviving at 800 mM. Helianthus paradoxus was<br />highly salt tolerant, with some plants surviving at 1300 mM. Salt tolerance<br />was a d o m i n a n t trait, with hybrids between H. paradoxus and cultivated H.<br />annuus doing as well as the wild parent.<br />CONCLUSIONS<br />During plant evolution, mechanisms enabling plants to survive stress have<br />been selected, not all o f which fully maintain the plant's productive process<br />(Turner, 1979 ). For p!ants living in natural ecosystems, survival of environmental stress is probably more important than high grain (seed) productivity, whereas in agricultural systems, maximization of productivity is of param o u n t importance (Turner, 1981 ). It is conceivable, therefore, that during<br />selection by plant breeders for high seed productivity, other desirable characteristics such as drought tolerance may have been inadvertently lost and<br />current breeding programs to improve drought tolerance, iii cultivated sunflower may benefit from an infusion of germplasm from wild sunflower<br />species.<br />The g~mus Helianthus, besides c~,nstituting the ba:iic genetic stock from<br />which cultivated sunflower originated, continues to contribute specific characterisdcs for cultivated sunflower i m p r o v e m e n t and there still remains m u c h<br />poter~tial to be exploited. The continued need for additional genes to improve<br />cultivated sunflower emphasizes the necessity to collect, maintain, evaluate,<br />and enhance wild Helianthus germplasm for future utilization in cultivated<br />sunflower.<br /><br />REFERENCES<br />Anashchenko, A.V., 1974.

Moench] in the field. In efforts to build simulation models of ratoon grain sorghum, modellers have assumed that the planted and ratoon crops grow similarily. This study was undertaken to document the growth of ratoon grain sorghum and test the hypothesis that growth and development of the ratoon crop is similar to the planted crop. Experiments were conducted from 1985 through 1987 under irrigated field conditions using nine hybrids of medium/medium-late maturity on a Houston Black clay: fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellustert. In two of the three years, grain-yield of the planted crop exceeded the ratoon while grain-yield was equal in the other year studied. Rapid development of tillers produced much higher leaf-area indexes (L) and vegetative biomass early in the plant's ontogeny for the ratoon compared to the planted crop. Depending on hybrid and year, each primary shoot (PS) of the planted crop produced from 4 to 7 tillers within 20 days of harvest of the planted crop. At harvest, however, only 2–3 tillers/PS remained and only 1.7 tillers/PS (on average) produced grain. The planted crop allocated a higher proportion of its total above-ground biomass to grain than did the ratoon crop. Differences in the degree of tillering and partitioning of biomass to grain were found among hybrids. Yet, a significant hybrid×year interaction suggests that partitioning was dependent on the environment. Phenology of planted and ratoon crops were similar. Grain-forming tillers produced the same number of leaves as the primary shoot of the planted crop, and differences in time to anthesis between the planted and ratoon crops averaged approximately 100 of the 1000 heat units (7°C base temperature). Based on our observations, the assumption that growth of planted and ratoon grain sorghum are similar appears to be in error.

In efforts to build simulation models of ratoon grain sorghum, modellers have assumed that the planted and ratoon crops grow similarily. This study was undertaken to document the growth of ratoon grain sorghum and test the hypothesis that growth and development of the ratoon crop is similar to the planted crop. Experiments were conducted from 1985 through 1987 under irrigated field conditions using nine hybrids of medium/medium-late maturity on a Houston Black clay: fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellustert.<br />In two of the three years, grain-yieldof the planted crop exceeded the ratoon while grain-yield was equal in the other year studied. Rapid development of tillers produced much higher leaf-area indexes (L) and vegetative biomass early in the plant's ontogeny for the ratoon compared to the planted crop. Depending on hybrid and year, each primary shoot (PS) of the planted crop produced from 4 to 7 tillers within 20 days of harvest of the planted crop. At harvest, however, only 2-3 tillers/PS remained and only 1.7 tillers/PS (on average) produced grain.<br />The planted crop allocated a higher proportion of its total above-ground biomass to grain than did the ratoon crop. Differences in the degree of tillering and partitioning of biomass to grain were found among hybrids. Yet, a significant hybrid×year interaction suggests that partitioning was dependent on the environment. Phenology of planted and ratoon crops were similar. Grain-forming tillers produced the same number of leaves as the primary shoot of the planted crop, and differences in time to anthesis between the planted and ratoon crops averaged approximately 100 of the 1000 heat units (7 °C base temperature). Based on our observations, the assumption that growth of planted and ratoon grain sorghum are similar appears to be in error.

Advantages of ratoon systems over other multiplecropping systems are that ratoon systems require only one planting. Growth of the ratoon crop begins immediately after harvest of the planted crop, permitting full use of the growing-season for crop development. These advantages have stimulated research to improve management practices associated with ratoon grain sorghum and to identify areas suitable for ratoon sorghum production (Escalada and Plucknett, 1975a, b; Duncan, 1979, 1981; Duncan et al., 1980; Duncan and Gardner, 1984; Duncan and Moss, 1987). Yet, reported grain yield of the ratoon crop has ranged from 30 to 60% of the planted crop (Touchton and Martin, 1981; Duncan and Moss, 1987).<br />Simulation models of ratoon grain sorghum have also been developed to determine areas of potential adaptation by evaluating the productivity/risk potential of the ratoon system for diverse environments, and the effects of the ratoon crop on soil erosion and runoff (Stinson et al., 1981; Gerik et al., 1988). These models assume that growth and development of the ratoon crop closely mimics that of the planted crop. Gerik et al. (1988), however, simulated grain yield 20% greater than the observed yield for the ratoon crop, whereas simulated yield of the planted crop was about 10% less than the averaged observed value. The extent to which assumptions of similar growth habit between the planted and ratoon crop can be used for simulation purposes is not known. This study was undertaken to document the growth and development of fieldgrown ratoon grain sorghum and test the hypothesis that growth and phenological and morphological development of ratoon and planted grain sorghum are similar. Knowledge of these plant attributes under normal field situations is needed if we are to understand ratoon plant development for simulation purposes and improve cultural practices and/or plant selection methods.<br />MATERIALSAND METHODS<br />An irrigated field-study was conducted over three years, 1985 through 1987, at the Blackland Research Center, Temple, TX, to compare morphological and phenological development of planted and ratoon grain sorghum. Nine hybrids of medium or medium-late maturity, ATX623 × RTX430, ATX378 × RTX430, Conlee 'Tophand TA', Dekalb 'DK42-Y', Funk 'G-522DR', Funk 'G-611', Northrup King (NK) 'Savannah 5', Paymaster 'DR1099', and Warner '840DR', were planted each year in mid-march on a Houston Black clay soil: fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellustert. Hybrids known to have different yield potential for the planted and ratoon crops were chosen on the recommendation of Dr. R.R. Duncan, Univ. of Georgia, Griffin, GA. Plots, three rows spaced 0.69 m apart and 12.0 m long, were arranged in a randomized complete-block design with four replications. The planted crop was fertilized prior to planting<br /><br />PHENOLOGY, EARLY GROWTH, AND YIELD OF PLANTED AND RATOON GRAIN SORGHUM<br /><br />207<br /><br />with 150 kg N ha -1 and hand-thinned to a final density of 12.5 plants m -2 after emergence. Soil tests indicated that phosphorus, potassium, and other essential nutrients were present in sufficient quantities for maximum grainyield. Following harvest of the planted crop, stubble was removed with a silage harvester. Stubble cutting height was approximately 0.08-0.10 m. The ratoon crop was fertilized with 150 kg N ha -1 in 1985 and 1986 and 250 kg N ha -1 in 1987 after stubble removal. Approximately 25 mm of water was applied via sprinkler irrigation immediately after fertilization.<br /><br />Leaf and plant development<br /><br />Leaf area and total biomass were collected on four hybrids (Northrup-King Savannah 5, Dekalb DK42-Y, ATX623 × RTX430, and RTX378 × RTX430) for the planted and ratoon crops during vegetative development in 1985 and 1986 and at flowering each year. Six primary shoots (PS) of the planted crop and tillers associated with six PS for the ratoon crop were harvested from the center row of each plot for leaf-area and biomass analyses. The harvested biomass was separated into leaf and culm tissue and oven-dried. Prior to ovendrying, the cumulative leaf area tiller- 1and PS- 1were determined with a leafarea meter (LICOR model 3100, Lambda Instruments, Lincoln, NE).<br />To characterize vegetative development of the ratoon crop, the number of tillers and cumulative leaf number were determined on the four cultivars by making repeated observations on six PS within each plot twice weekly. Vegetative development was evaluated from stover removal of the planted crop to anthesis of the ratoon crop. Because tillering was minimal for all hybrids of the planted crop (Gerik and Neely, 1987), only cumulative leaf number of the main culm was recorded. Anthesis dates for the planted and ratoon crops were determined each year on 20 sequential PS located in the center row of each plot. Anthesis was evaluated in respect to the number of calendar days and thermal time (HU: cumulative heat units above a base temperature of 7 °C ) by tagging individual panicles when 50% of the anthers appeared. The anthesis period, defined as the time between 50% anthesis of the first panicle and last panicle within each plot, was also determined.<br /><br />Grain-yield and yield components<br /><br />Grain-yield, kernel number panicle -1, kernel weight, stover or vegetative weight and density of grain-producing culms were determined for each cultivar after physiological maturity from 2-m sections of the center row of each experimental unit. The stover or vegetative biomass was considered to be the above-ground portion minus the grain. Dry-matter samples were dried in a forced-air oven at 60°C immediately after harvest. Weights reported herein are on an oven-dry basis.<br /><br />208 T.J. GERIK ET AL.<br />Statistical analyses were performed using least-squares analysis of variance procedures and mean-separation procedures described by Steel and Torrie (1980) and Anonymous (1985).<br />RESULTSAND DISCUSSION<br />Earlygrowth<br />Development of both the planted and ratoon crop in each year of the study is summarized in Table 1. Emergence of the planted crop and tiller appearance of the ratoon crop occurred on or near the same calendar day each year. Time to anthesis and harvest varied among years for the planted and ratoon crops.<br />For the ratoon crop, tillers that developed at basal nodes of the main culm were responsible for grain formation. The formation and senescence of tillers following harvest of the planted crop is illustrated for hybrids that demonstrated the highest and lowest tillering ability -- ATX623 × RTX430 and NK Savannah 5, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Tillers formed rapidly at axillary buds in the internodal area between the brace roots of the primary shoot (PS) of the planted crop following stover removal. More than 80% of tillers were present within 8 days after stover removal of the planted crop. Tiller senescence began approximately 20 days after planted-crop stover removal. Depending upon hybrid and year, the maximum number of tillers on the PS averaged from 4 to 7, within the range reported by Duncan et al. (1980). By anthesis of the ratoon crop, the number of tillers PS-1 had declined to approximately one-half of the number initiated. The number of tillers formed and senesced for DeKalb DS42-Y and ATX378xRTX430 were between NK Savannah 5 and ATX623 × RTX430.<br />Til!ering at the onset of the ratoon crop promoted rapid leaf-area development and biomass accumulation. Data from 1985 and 1986 illustrate that cumulative leaf area of tillers on the PS and L at the pre-anthesis harvest, measured within the first 3 weeks from the onset of tiller appearance, were greater than or equal to those obtained for the planted crop near anthesis-e.g., approximately 7 weeks from emergence (Table 2 ). There are strong correlations between crop dry-matter accumulation and transpiration, E t (Hanks et al., 1969) and between E t and crop nutrient uptake (Verasan and Phillips, 1978; O'Toole and Baldia, 1982). Large L and vegetative biomass produced early in the ontogeny of the ratoon crop suggest that the crop's water demand and nutrient uptake are greater for the ratoon than for the planted crop.<br />Although biomass accumulation of the ratoon crop on PS and land-area bases exceeded that of the planted crops in the early stages of development, leaf area and dry-weight of individual tillers of ratoon plants were considerably less than<br /><br />PHENOLOGY,EARLYGROWTH,ANDYIELDOFPLANTEDANDRATOONGRAINSORGHUM<br /><br />209<br /><br />TABLE 1<br /><br />Calendar of biomass and leaf area sampling for the planted and ratoon crops during the course of study<br /><br />Year/crop<br /><br />Growth stage1<br /><br />Calendar date<br /><br />Day of year<br /><br />Time from emergence2 (days)<br /><br />1985 Planted 1985 Ratoon 1986 Planted 1986 Ratoon 1985 Planted 1987 Ratoon<br /><br />Emergence Pre-anthesis Anthesis Harvest<br />Tiller Appearance Pre-anthesis Anthesis Harvest<br />Emergence Pre-anthesis Anthesis Harvest<br />Tiller Appearance Pre-anthesis Anthesis Harvest<br />Emergence Anthesis Harvest<br />Tiller Appearance Flowering Harvest<br /><br />25 March 10 May 11 June 17 July<br />1 Aug. 14 Aug. 18 Sept. 19 Nov.<br />24 March 12 May 19 June 21 July<br />1 Aug. 20 Aug. 26 Sept. 30 Oct.<br />24 March 8 June 27 July<br />1 Aug. 15 Sept. 12 Nov.<br /><br />84 130 162 198<br />213 226 261 323<br />83 132 170 202<br />213 232 269 303<br />83 159 208<br />213 258 316<br /><br />46 78 114<br />13 48 110<br />49 87 119<br />19 56 90<br />76 125<br />45 103<br /><br />~Emergence: the time of 50% seedling emergence and onset of tiller appearance for the planted and ratoon crops, respectively; Pre-anthesis: sampling occurred near time of panicle initiation; Anthesis: anther appearance on 50% of plants within each plot; Harvest occurred within 3-5 days after last genotype reached physiological maturity. 2(or tiller appearance).<br /><br />the PS of planted crop during the same period.

Hence, the prevailing temperatures from emergence to anthesis explained most of difference in time to flower between the planted and ratoon crops.<br />The anthesis period, the time between appearance of the first and last anthers, differed, among hybrids, among crops, and between years (Tables 4 and 5). In 1985 and 1987, respectively, mean anthesis periods of the ratoon crop were 120 and 140% (expressed as days ) and 118 and 75% (expressed as °Cd) longer than the planted crop. Anthesis periods were similar in 1986 between the planted and ratoon crops when expressed as days or HU. Average air temperatures during the anthesis period of the planted crop were 27.8, 27.4 and 27.9 °C, and for the ratoon crop were 22.9, 27.6 and 23.0°C in 1985, 1986, and 1987, respectively. Hence, cool temperatures in 1985 and 1987 could have extended the anthesis period of the ratoon crop.<br /><br />Yield and yield components<br /><br />Tiller development is important in yield formation of the ratoon crop, but the total number of tillers at harvest was quite variable among hybrids and between years (Table 6). The number of tillers present at harvest of the ratoon crop were from two to three times the number of primary shoots in the planted crop. The number of grain-forming tillers at harvest of the ratoon was approximately 1.7 times higher than the planted crop when averaged over hybrids and years.<br />Tillers of the ratoon crop produced smaller panicles with fewer kernels than primary shoots of the planted crop (Table 7).

Ratoon kernel weight rarely exceeded the planted crop. In general, kernel weights of the ratoon crop were equal to or lower than those of the planted crop.<br />Generally, grain-yields were lower for the ratoon than the planted crop. Ratoon grain-yield was higher in 1987 than the other years of study, and approached those attained by the planted crop (Tables 8 and 9). Kernel number per panicle was the yield component that contributed to the high 1987 ratoon grain-yield, with the number of reproductive tillers and kernel weight remaining fairly constant over years. From a cultural standpoint, the primary difference between 1987 and the other years was in the quantity of nitrogen applied at the beginning of the ratoon crop (250 in 1987 v. 150 kg N ha -1 in 1985 and 1986). The 1987 ratoon yields were similar to those reported by Escalada and Plucknett (1977).<br />The partitioning of dry-matter between grain and stover differed between planted and ratoon crops (Tables 8 and 9).

However, allocation of biomass between grain and stover differed among hybrids each year. The variation in grain-yield and kernel number tiller-1 was greater among hybrids for the ratoon than the planted crop (Tables 8 and 9). For the planted crop, Funks G611, Funks G-522DR, and Paymaster 1099DR were among the most efficient hybrids in partitioning drymatter to grain, while Conlee Tophand TA was among the least efficient. For the ratoon crop, Funks G611, Funks G-522DR, and Paymaster 1099DR were again among the most efficient grain-producing hybrids, and NK Savannah 5 and Conlee Tophand TA among the least efficient.<br />From the discussion above, it is evident that development and partitioning of biomass differ between planted and ratoon crops. Tillers, initiated from basal buds on the crown, appeared within the first 8-10 days after removal of the vegetative biomass of the planted crop. Depending upon hybrid and year, each primary shoot produced from 4 to 7 tillers before tillers began to senesce. Of all tillers produced, approximately 2-3 tillers PS- 1remained at harvest and only 1.7 tillers PS-1 produced grain. Consequently, the ratoon crop allocated a smaller proportion of its total above-ground biomass to grain compared to the planted crop. Differences were found among hybrids in the degree of till-<br /><br />216 T.J.

But, the significant interaction between hybrids and years suggest biomass partitioning to grain was more sensitive to environmental change in some of the hybrids compared to other hybrids studied.<br />From a phenology perspective, the planted and ratoon crops were very similar. The total number of leaves produced were equal between grain-forming tillers of the ratoon crop and individual plants of the planted crop. Time to anthesis was similar between the planted and ratoon crops when determined on an HU basis. Therefore, the phenology of panicle-producing tillers of the ratoon crop would not differ from plants of the planted crop provided the crops were not subjected to water deficits prior to anthesis. However, the duration of the flowering period was greater in two of the three years studied.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br /><br />Based on this study, one would conclude that the planted and ratoon crops differed in their ability to accumulate and allocate dry-matter between vegetative and grain biomass.

Differences in growth and drymatter allocation were greatest in the early developmental stages (i.e., the ratoon crop had approximately 5 and 7 times greater leaf area and number of actively growing shoots, respectively, than the planted crop). By harvest, differences in leaf area and shoot number had narrowed between the ratoon and planted crop. On average, the ratoon crop (at harvest) allocated 20% more of its total dry-matter to vegetative as compared to grain biomass. The ratoon's preference to produce vegetative over grain biomass suggest that the ratoon's requirements for water and nutrients to produce equivalent grain-yield to the planted crop would be greater.<br />Phenology of the planted and ratoon crops were similar. The time to anthesis differed by only 100 HU between the planted and ratoon crops (i.e., cumulative total HU to anthesis averaged 1000). Grain-forming tillers produced the same number of leaves as the primary shoot of the planted crop.<br />We conclude that assumption of similar growth between the planted and ratoon grain sorghum for simulation purposes is not correct. Further work is needed to determine the difference in water and nutrient requirements needed to produce equivalent grain-yields between the planted and ratoon crops.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: (1985) SAS User's Guide: Statistics, , Anonymous, 5th edition, SAS Institute, Cary, NC; <br />Duncan, Comparative grain yield relationships of three maturity groups of sorghum hybrids under ratoon cropping (1979) Cereal Res.

The N concentrations in the grain and stover of the planted crop were increased by both N rates applied at flowering of the planted crop.

Because these practices significantly reduce the time required for seedbed preparation and crop establishment, opportunities may exist in different<br />*Contribution of the Texas AgriculturalExperiment Station,Texas A &amp; M University System, in cooperation with the Georgia AgriculturalExperiment Station,University of Georgia.<br /><br />0378-4290/88/$03.50<br /><br />© 1988Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.<br /><br />64<br />regions to combine conservation tillage with multiple-cropping systems and improve crop productivity. Ratoon-cropping of grain sorghum is one approach that warrants consideration for conservation tillage systems in sub-tropical climates like those found in the southern U.S.A.<br />Advantages and disadvantages of ratoon-cropping have been enumerated by Plucknett et al. (1970). Advantages include elimination of land preparation for seeding of subsequent generations, and minimizing delay and other risks associated with crop establishment; disadvantages include increased production hazards associated with insects, diseases, and weed pests, reduced flexibility in selection of subsequent rotational crops, and increased risk of stored soil-water depletion accumulated during the fallow period between harvest of the planted sorghum crop and planting of the next annual crop. Consequently, a multiple-cropping strategy, like ratoon grain sorghum, can be a costly venture for farmers without a priori knowledge of its climatic and edaphic adaptability to the farmer's locale, cultivar performance, and other management practices needed to optimize productivity and minimize risk.<br />By definition, ratoon-cropping permits multiple harvests from a single planting. In the southern U.S., the planted grain sorghum crop would be sown in early spring and harvested in mid July or early August, to yield 6 Mg/ha grain under good conditions. Ratoon sorghum would be harvested in late October or mid November, and could boost the total grain yield by 3-4 Mg/ha. Although limited information is available on the optimization of cultural practices, crop development,and performance of commercialand experimental grain sorghum hybrids in the ratoon growth phase, reports have addressed some of the important considerations for ratoon sorghum managment (Escalada and Plucknett, 1975a,b, 1977; Duncan, 1979, 1981; Duncan et al., 1980; Touchton and Martin, 1981; Duncan and Gardner, 1984). Given the complex interactions between the environment and crop growth and development, it is difficult to ascertain the potential of ratoon grain sorghum at any given location. Crop simulation is one tool that may be used to evaluate potential cropping strategies, like ratoon grain sorghum, over time at specific locations, and would be particularly useful in identifying research needs and priorities. Use of crop models to evaluate cropping strategies is gaining increased acceptance because of their abilities to combine historical climatic data and mathematical descriptions of crop growth and associated physical processes to assess the long-term implications of different cropping systems and strategies (Stinson et al., 1981; Jordan et al., 1983; Arkin and Dugas, 1984}. SORKAM,a dynamic crop simulation model, was developedto emulate plant growth, development,and predict crop water use and grain yield of grain sorghum from seed to harvest of the planted crop (Rosenthal et al., 1988). Our objectives were (1) to determine if SORKAM could be used for estimating grain yields and crop phenology for the ratoon growth phase of sorghum over diverse climatic and ecological regions,<br /><br />65<br />and (2) to determine the potential areas within the eastern half of Texas suitable for ratoon grain sorghum.<br />MATERIALSAND METHODS<br />The dynamic grain sorghum plant growth model, SORKAM,described by Rosenthal et al. (1988) was modified to simulate both the planted crop and the ratoon crop. Changes made to SORKAM for this study include: Sowing date simulation. Sowing dates were estimated using ambient air temperatures and soil moisture content of the top 0.15-m soil layer. Conditions necessary for sowing to occur were (1) 4-day average ambient temperature &gt;~14.4 °C, and (2) soil water content &lt; 90% of the soil water-holding capacity upper limit. Sowing, however, was not permitted to occur prior to the earliest sowing date known at each site. Grain moisture simulation. Grain drying after physiological maturity for the planted and ratoon crop was estimated to determine date of harvest. The algorithm, developed from data by Bruns (1975) and G.F. Arkin (Blackland Research Center, Temple, TX, unpublished data, 1979), is given by<br />PERMOS: 48.2 X exp ( - 0.15 X SEo)<br />where PERMOS is the percentage grain moisture and SEo is the accumulated daily potential evapotranspiration after physiological maturity. Harvest dates were determined when PERMOS was &lt; 20%. Simulated grain yields were then corrected to a dry-weight basis for comparisons with observed yields, and to standardize the multi-year simulations among sites. Ratoon crop simulation. The ratoon crop was assumed to develop in the same manner as the planted crop. Ratoon growth and development were estimated with the same routines as those used for the planted crop. Once harvest of the planted crop occurred, all plant-growth variables were reinitialized to their beginning value, with exception of the crop rooting depth, RTDEP, assumed to remain at the maximum rooting depth estimated for the planted crop.<br />Model validation<br />The modified grain sorghum model was validated by comparing simulated versus actual grain yields of the planted and ratoon crops from reports of Duncan and Moss (1986, 1987) from Griffin and Plains, GA, and Sij (1986) from Beaumont, TX. Climatic, edaphic, cultural, and irrigation information needed for the operation of the model were gathered for each site. Observations of<br /><br />66<br />planted and ratoon crop grain yields were also obtained from 1985 irrigated field studies at Temple, TX. Ten cultivars, Northrup King 'Savanna 5', Conlee 'Tophand TA', Coker '7737', Warner 'W-840 DR', Funk 'G-522 DR', Funk 'G611', Dekalb 'DK-42Y', Paymaster '1099', ATx623 × RTx430, and ATx378xRTx430, were planted in mid-March at the Blackland Research Center, Temple, TX, on a fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts. Plots consisting of three rows, spaced 0.69 m apart and 12.0 m long, were arranged in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. The planted crop was fertilized prior to planting with 100 kg N/ha and hand-thinned to a final density of 12.5 plants/m 2 after emergence. Following harvest of the planted crop, stubble was removed with a silage harvester. Stubble-cutting height was approximately 0.08-0.10 m. The ratoon crop was fertilized with 100 kg N/ha after stubble removal. Soil tests indicated that phosphorus, potassium, and other essential nutrients were present in sufficient quantities for maximum grain yield. Grain yield of the first crop and ratoon growth were determined by hand-harvesting 2 m from the center row of each plot. Grain yields from all data sets were corrected to a dry-weight basis for comparisons with simulated results.<br />Application<br />To illustrate the use of the grain sorghum simulation model, SORKAM,as a method to evaluate the potential of rainfed ratoon grain sorghum over diverse edaphic and climatic zones, historic weather and soil data were collected for 14 locations over the eastern half of Texas (Tables 1 and 2). Criteria for site selection were the availability of historical climatic data and known history of grain sorghum production. Climatic data sets were obtained for each site from the National Weather Service cooperative and first-order stations and Federal Aviation Agency stations for each site (Dugas, 1983 ). Availability of historical weather records varied among locations. The number of consecutive yearly weather records used for ratoon-cropping simulations are found in Table 1. Simulations were made using all available climatic data at each site (15-30 years). Average yearly rainfall over the study area varied from approx. 600 mm at Uvalde to 1400 mm at Beaumont, TX. Edaphic information needed for simulation purposes was based on the general knowledge of soils used for sorghum production at each site (H. Bogush, Soil Conservation Service, Temple, TX, personal communication, 1987). Soil series and related parameters used for each site are described in Table 1. Soils at most locations were classified as montmorillonitic clays that had plant-available water-holding capacity &gt; 190 mm. Lighter-textured soils, loam and loamy-mixed, at three of the 14 locations had plant-available water-holding capacities of approx. 160 mm.<br />Simulations were conducted as if the ratoon grain sorghum was grown in<br /><br />67<br /><br />TABLE 1<br /><br />Mean annual lmlnfall for each location, years of climatic data, soil type and soil parameters used for ratoon simulations at each location<br /><br />Location<br /><br />Mean rainfallt (ram)<br /><br />Years of climatic data<br /><br />Soil parameters ~<br /><br />Slope (%)<br /><br />Curve number<br /><br />Plant available water (mm)<br /><br />Texas<br />Angleton Beaumont Beeville Brownwood Center College Station Columbus Corpus Christi Dallas Gonzales Stephenville Temple Uvalde Weslaco<br />Georgia<br />Griffin Plains<br />*Dugas, 1983. ~Anonymous, 1986.<br /><br />1279 1389 780 653 1282 973 1040 745 877<br />844 704 874 605 580<br />1280 1125<br /><br />31 17 30 30 30 27 16 31 31 15 24 36 31 31<br />---<br /><br />0.5 89 0.5 89 1.0 79 2.0 83 1.0 83 1.0 89 1.0 81 0.5 89 2.0 89 1.0 81 1.0 79 1.0 89 1.0 81 0.5 79<br />1.0 89 1.0 67<br /><br />195 210 165 189 195 156 195 216 210 195 180 210 210 165<br />194 159<br /><br />monoculture for the recorded weather period at each site. Soil water content was simulated for 365 days each year. Although monoculture ratoon grain sorghum repeated over multiple years is not practical, given the recognized benefits of alternate crop rotations, it was useful to standardize cropping practices among sites and to provide us with an estimate of the effect of soil water depletion by the ratoon crop on productivity of subsequent spring-planted crops from year to year. Simulated results could differ if the crop or land-use prior to ratoon grain sorghum at the simulation site altered the spring planting data, or the initial soil water content, from those obtained with the planted and ratoon-crop monocrop simulations. Cultural practices commonlyused by Texas sorghum growers used for execution of the model were plant density of 14.0 p l a n t s / m 2, row spacing of 0.76 m, and crop maturity classification, medium.<br /><br />68<br /><br />TABLE 2<br /><br />Soil series and classification used for ratoon simulations at each location<br /><br />Location<br /><br />Soil series<br /><br />Taxonomic classification*<br /><br />Texas<br />Angleton Beaumont Beeville Brownwood Center College<br />Station Columbus Corpus<br />Christi Dallas Gonzales Stephenville Temple Uvalde Weslaco<br />Georgia Griffin Plains<br /><br />Lake Charles Beaumont Orelia Leeray Bowie Miller<br />Lufkin Victoria<br />Houston Black Burleson Frio Houston Black Uvalde Hildago<br />Cecil Greenville<br /><br />*Anonymous, 1986.<br /><br />fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Typic Pelluderts fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Entic Pelluderts fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic, Typic Ochragualfs fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Typic Peleudults fine, loamy, siliceous,thermic, Plinthic Paleudults fine, mixed,thermic, Vertic Haplustolls<br />fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Vertic Albagualfs fine, montmorillonitic, hyperthermic, Udic Pellusterts<br />fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Udic Pellusterts fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Udic Pellusterts fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, CumulicHaplustolls fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Udic Pellusterts fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermic, Aridic Calciustolls fine-loamy,mixed, hyperthermic, Typic Calciustolls<br />clayey,kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Hapludulfs clayey,kaolinitic, thermic, Rhodic Paleudults<br /><br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br /><br />Validation<br /><br />Regressions of simulated/observed grain yields illustrate that the model was unable to account for many genetic parameters associated with grain yield of the planted, ratoon, and combined crops when cultivars of lower ratoon-yield potential were included in the analysis (Table 3). The highest R2values were obtained from regressions of simulated/observed grain yields when only the highest-yielding ratoon cultivars at each location were used.<br />Simulated yields were generally within 25 % of those observed for the planted, ratoon, and combined (planted + ratoon) crops for the highest-yielding ratoon cultivars (Fig. 1 ). The model tended to overestimate the grain yields for the ratoon crop and underestimate those of the planted crop. With two exceptions, the combined yield estimates of the planted and ratoon crops appeared to be equally distributed around the 1 :1 line for the comparison of combined simulated and observed grain yields.

Given the large differences in plant development between the ratoon and planted crop as reported by Escalada and Plucknett (1975a, 1977), and that plant growth/ development algorithms of SORKAM were developed to emulate the planted crop, the model produced realistic estimates of grain yield for the ratoon crop of sorghum. Because published data sets for grain yield of the planted, ratoon, and combined crops have reported that cultivars which produced the highest ratoon grain yield generally produced the highest yield for the planted and combined crops (Duncan and Moss, 1986, 1987; Sij, 1986), it could be assumed that the highest-yieldingratoon cultivars wouldbe used in ratoon grain sorghum cropping systems. Although phenological data were not available from Georgia or Temple, TX, simulated harvest dates were within 7-10 days of actual dates at Beaumont, TX.<br /><br />Application<br /><br />To illustrate the application of SORKAMfor evaluating ratoon grain-sorghum cropping, 14 sites with varied soils and climates were selected over the eastern half of Texas. Estimates of grain yield, crop phenology, and water use were made to evaluate the adaptability of ratoon grain sorghum for the different cropping regions and/or farming systems. Results of multi-year simulations for these sites indicated that the area surrounding Beaumont and Angleton, or the area south and east of Columbus, had the highest probability, &gt; 0.70, of producing annual ratoon grain yields greater than 3.0 Mg/ha (Fig. 2).

Probabilityof simulatedratoon grainyields &gt; 3.0 Mg/ha for regionsofTexas.<br />probability of attaining ratoon grain yields of 3.0 Mg/ha rapidly declined for the area north and west of Columbus. Closer examination of these results indicate that ratoon grain sorghum could increase grain yields over the first crop from 2.0 to 6.0 Mg/ha each year for an area with high ratoon potential: e.g. Beaumont (Fig. 3). At College Station, a site with intermediate ratoon cropping potential -- with a 4-in-10-year probability of ratoon grain yields greater than 3.0 Mg/ha - - ratoon sorghum could increase grain yields approximately 85% of the time over those of the planted crop alone. However, a site with low ratoon potential - - e.g. Temple, with 2.5-in- 10-year probability of ratoon grain yields greater than 3.0 Mg/ha - - would have grain-yield increases from the ratoon crop in only 5 of 10 years, and could experience reductions for the subsequent planted crop approximately 30% of the time as a result of ratoon cropping use the previous year.<br />Although ratoon grain yields estimated by the model reflect the variation of ambient temperature, solar radiation, and soil water deficit during each growing period, other factors like maturation of the ratoon crop and the effects of soil water depletion by the ratoon crop are important in determining croppingsystem adaptability. Estimates of maturity for the ratoon crop were based on the date of grain physiological maturity and compared to first-freeze occurrence for each location and year. The probability of ratoon grain maturity prior to the first freeze was highest for areas immediately surrounding Beaumont and Angleton. Analysis revealed that the ratoon crop would mature prior to first freeze in 7 of 10 years for areas east and south of Columbus (Fig. 4). For areas to the north and west of Columbus the probability of freeze before physiological grain maturity increases, and becomes a major limitation in adopting ratoon grain sorghum to conventional or conservation tillage farming systems.<br /><br />72<br /><br />I.O<br />--<br />0.6O.8 ---<br /><br />II<br />PLANTED PLANTED<br /><br />I r, + RATOON CROP !<br />!<br />/<br /><br />II<br /><br />0.4 iI I I<br />0.2 I i¢<br />/<br />0 I III<br /><br />0.81.0 --<br /><br />i<br /><br />I<br /><br />i/<br /><br />,<br /><br />cropPLANTED + RATOON<br />PLANTED<br /><br />i 0.6<br /><br />II<br />i, ./~<br /><br />0.4<br />0.2 COLLEGE STATION<br />0 IIII II<br />0.60""-e--i~ A ~,.o --'PLAN'~ED.R;,TOO,.""

Comparisons of simulated soil water contents on 1 April of the planted and ratoon crop versus the planted crop alone are given in Fig. 5. At Beaumont, for example, profile soil-water contents of the planted and ratoon crops reached the same level of those from the planted crop alone by 1 April each year. Soil water recharge was more variable for sites like Temple and College Station. Results illustrate that soil water depletion by the ratoon crop could reduce the amount of water initially available for production of spring-planted crop in some years. The failure of the ratoon crop to permit soil water recharge was responsible for the lower yield of the ratoon system (planted + ratoon) compared to the single-crop system in approximately 3 of 10 years at a site like Temple (Fig. 4).<br /><br />73<br /><br />.25 ,20<br />.15 ,tO .05<br /><br />o E COLLEGEST..,O,~ ' Z j 7<br /><br />o<br />? o .,s<br />.'°<br /><br />~ .05<br /><br />STEPHENVILLEe<br /><br />/ .... ~.<br /><br />&lt; -t 0<br /><br />IIIII<br /><br />k<br /><br />BROWNWOOO""<br /><br />/ CENTE~,~-.7<br /><br />• TEMPL.~, '''~ I<br /><br />TEM~LE ' ' ' ~<br /><br />\ COLLIE STA;,~,.f, ~A-9 .25<br /><br />J B[AUMON""re /<br /><br />,20<br /><br />COLUMBUSe<br /><br />.15<br /><br />~ ZONZ~LES~ ~l~<br />-- SCIA.

The model can evaluate climatic and edaphic variability in respect to ratoon grain sorghum by simulating the effect of temperature on crop phenology and growing-season duration, and the interaction of temperature, precipitation, and plant-available soil-water capacity on crop phenology and yield. At present, the model cannot simulate many genetic parameters associated with grain yield and so was unable to adequately simulate yields of cultivars that had low ratoon grain yields. Although refinements are needed to improve the ability of the model to better emulate genetic and physiological parameters associated<br /><br />74<br />with grain yield and environmental parameters, e.g. plant nutrients, it is re-<br />sponse to three important variables that drive plant growth processes -- light,<br />temperature, and water stress (Rosenthal et al., 1988).<br />T h e a p p l i c a t i o n of SORKAM to e v a l u a t e t h e p o t e n t i a l of r a t o o n grain s o r g h u m<br />over diverse regions of Texas illustrated how the use of crop simulation models<br />can be used to assess the adaptability of a ratoon grain sorghum to specific<br />locations with divergent climatic and edaphic characteristics. With the use of<br />historical weather data and/or computer weather generators, the model could<br />play an important role in determining crop development, crop water use, and<br />yield probabilities for regions of the world where resources limit conventional<br />research and testing.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: (1986) Classification of Soil Series of the United States.

In the crayfish-rice double cropping system, rice is planted in the spring (Anonymous, 1987) and adult brood crayfish are stocked at the rate of approximately 50 kg/ha following the establishment of the permanent rice flood. Crayfish burrow underground and rice is managed for grain production. Following rice harvest (late summer), rice regrowth is encouraged and the pond is flooded to approximately 38 cm in October. Adult crayfish and broods of young emerge<br /><br />0044-8486/88/$03.50<br /><br />0 1988 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.<br /><br />266<br />from their summer burrows and “stock” the pond, subsisting on decaying rice stubble and the detrital organisms associated with it (Chien and Avault, 1980; Brunson and Lunscombe, 1987). Rice is currently the most commonly recommended and utilized planted forage for crayfish.<br />The development of crayfish production into an expanding American aquacultural industry (63 000 ha in 1987-198887% in Louisiana) and the concomitant intensification of cultural practices have resulted in a demand for alternative plant forage species to double crop with crayfish. One agronomic crop with demonstrated potential is grain sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. Grain sorghum production in Louisiana has increased in recent years (Anonymous, 1986) because farmers have become interested in alternatives to soybeans Glycine max (L.) Merr., for use in their farming enterprises. As grain sorghum gains prominence in south Louisiana, farmers are interested in its possible integration with crayfish production. Preliminary studies indicate that grain sorghum may be well suited to application in crayfish double cropping as well as monoculture systems (Brunson, 1987; Brunson and Taylor, 1987).<br />This study was conducted to compare rice-crayfish and sorghum-crayfish double cropping systems in south Louisiana.<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br /><br />Studies were conducted in eight 0.12-ha low-levee (&lt; 50 cm) ponds located<br /><br />at the South Unit of the Rice Research Station in Crowley, LA. Ponds had<br /><br />previously been in crayfish production, contained resident populations of cray-<br /><br />fish, and were not re-stocked for this study. Four ponds each were randomly<br /><br />assigned to either rice or grain sorghum systems each year. Rice (cultivar<br /><br />‘Mars’) was drill seeded at 101 kg/ha on 6 June 1985 and 10 June 1986 into a<br /><br />conventionally prepared seedbed (Anonymous, 1987)) and grain sorghum<br /><br />(cultivar ‘Paymaster R1090’) was planted at 6.7 kg/ha on 76-cm row spacings into a similar seedbed on 7 June 1985 and 13 June 1986. Fertilizer at the rate<br /><br />of 67-67-67 kg/ha (N-P,O,-K,O) was broadcast and incorporated prior to<br /><br />planting both rice and grain sorghum, and in 1986, an additional 45-O-O kg/<br /><br />ha ( N-P205-K20 ) was applied on both crops after stand establishment. Rice<br /><br />was briefly irrigated to encourage stand development, and propanil (3’,4’ -<br /><br />dichloropropionanilde [IV- (3,4-dichlorophenyl) propionamide] ) at 4.5 kg ai<br /><br />(active ingredient) /ha was applied on 26 June 1985 and 30 June 1986 for con-<br /><br />trol of grassy weeds. Rice was permanently flooded immediately following pro-<br /><br />panil application. A tank mix of metolachlor (2-chloro-IV- [2-ethyl-6-<br /><br />methylphenyl] -N- [ 2-methoxy-1-methylethyl]<br /><br />acetamide ) plus atrazine (2-<br /><br />chloro-4- [ethylamino] -6- [ isopropylamino] -s-triazine) at 1.12 + 1.7 kg/ha was<br /><br />surface applied for pre-emergent weed control following sorghum planting.<br /><br />267<br />Stand densities were visually rated 3 weeks after planting and classified as excellent, good, fair, or poor.<br />Both crops were harvested at maturity with a grain combine on 28 September 1985 and 5 October 1986 for rice and on 16 September 1985 and 20 September 1986 for grain sorghum. In all ponds, the straw spreader on the combine was disconnected to allow straw and residue to fall into narrow rows behind the combine. Grain yields were adjusted to U.S. reporting standards of 12% and 13% moisture for rice and sorghum, respectively.<br />Ponds were flooded to a depth of 38 cm on 15 October 1985 and 22 October 1986 and a flood was maintained for crayfish production until May. Prior to flooding, a 2.3-m’ sample of vegetation was taken from each pond to determine straw and stubble dry matter (DM) residual from grain harvest and biomass of green ratoon growth present. Similar samples were taken at 6-week intervals throughout the crayfish harvest season. All samples were dried to a constant weight in a forced air drier at 60’ C and DM biomass was determined.<br />Dissolved oxygen (D.O. ) was monitored at dawn three times weekly in each pond throughout the growing and harvest season. When dawn D.O. levels dropped below 3 mg/l, aerated well water was flushed through the ponds for several hours.<br />Beginning 14 February 1985 and 3 February 1986, crayfish were harvested by weekday trapping after a 24-h baited set, using 3-flue pyramid traps at a density of 74 traps/ha. Traps were initially baited with cut fish, but as water temperatures increased during the season one of several commercially manufactured crayfish baits was used. Between 14 February and 23 May 1985, total harvest effort expended was 5486 trap-days/ha, and between 3 February and 15 May 1986, a total effort of 5708 trap-days/ha was expended. Trapping effort and frequency were consistent across all ponds.<br />Experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Data were subjected to SAS analysis of variance procedures for personal computers (SAS Institute, 1985 1. Unless significant (PC 0.05) year effects were detected, data were pooled over years. Differences among treatment means were determined by Fisher’s protected least significant difference (LSD ).<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Rice grain production averaged 3192 kg/ha (Table 1) and was similar both years. Rice stands were classified as fair to good, and average production was well below the 1985 and 1986 Louisiana averages of 5181 and 5465 kg/ha, respectively (Anonymous, 1986). The low yields are attributed to poor stands and late planting dates. Mid-June is well past the recommended optimum planting date for rice in southwest Louisiana (Anonymous, 1987 ), but delayed planting is necessary if crayfish are harvested from the ponds through late spring of the previous production season.

Grain production in the sorghum ponds averaged 3786 kg/ha, but production in 1986 (5024 kg/ha) was superior to that in 1985 (2549 kg/ha; Table 1). The yield difference between years was due primarily to the additional nitrogen application in 1986. The 1985 grain sorghum yield was similar,to that observed by Brunson and Taylor (1987) under low nitrogen fertility conditions in crayfish ponds, while the 1986 yield greatly exceeded the Louisiana statewide average of 4209 kg/ha (Anonymous, 1986). The 2-year average of 3786 kg/ha is an acceptable grain yield in this system since the crop residue and ratoon growth provide forage for subsequent crayfish production. However, with sufficient nitrogen fertilizer, grain yields may be significantly increased.<br />Straw and stubble DM present at fall flooding was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) for rice (3293 kg/ha) than for grain sorghum (2227 kg/ha; Table 1). This component represents the crop residue left after grain harvest and comprises standing stubble as well as scattered leaf and stem material expelled from the combine during harvest. The latter two are important substrates since they are the first materials subjected to microbial breakdown, and serve to initiate the detrital food web upon which juvenile crayfish forage during the fall (Momot et al., 1978).<br />A third plant component, green ratoon growth, provides detrital “fuel” later in the crayfish production season, after the initial food substrates have been depleted. Grain sorghum ratoon production exceeded that of the rice by approximately 4 : 1 (P &lt; 0.05 ) , averaging 3577 kg/ha (Table 1) . Rice ratoon yield (573 kg/ha) was adversely impacted by the late harvest date and was well below the average for ‘Mars’ rice determined in previous studies (Brunson et<br /><br />269<br />al., 1988). In those studies, ratoon DM biomass was negatively correlated with grain yield and with maturity group plus planting date.<br />Although differences in straw and ratoon DM were detected between rice and grain sorghum, total DM (straw + ratoon) present at crayfish pond flooding was similar (Table 1) . Differences between rice and grain sorghum existed only in biomass composition. Dry matter present at flooding in grain sorghum ponds consisted of 54% ratoon and 46% straw and stubble whereas rice-pond biomass was 15% ratoon and 85% straw and stubble. Biomass composition differences potentially have important fall water quality implications in commercial ponds. Romaire (1983) recommended a minimum of 2.0 mg/l D.O. for optimal crayfish production, and Melancon and Avault (1977) reported that significant crayfish mortality occurs at D.O. levels below 1.0 mg/l. Dawn dissolved oxygen levels in this study fell below 2.0 mg/l only twice (Fig. 1); oxygen was not considered a limiting factor to any pond.<br />Hymel (1984) concluded that dissolved oxygen is the water quality parameter most often limiting production in Louisiana crayfish ponds. Dissolved oxygen levels, in turn, are greatly dependent upon water temperature (Fig. 1) and upon decomposition rates and organic loading. Vegetative decomposition rates in the two systems under evaluation are reflected by biomass residual over time. Through at least the first 6 weeks post-flood, rice and sorghum ex-<br />Fig. 1.

There was no significant (P&gt; 0.10) difference between rice-pond and sorghum-pond D.O. regimes.<br /><br />270<br /><br />hibited similar biomass retention (Fig. 2). However, by 12 weeks post-flood, absolute sorghum biomass loss exceeded that of rice, resulting in a biomass difference that remained evident throughout the remainder of the study. In both systems, approximately 50% of the initial biomass disappeared during the first 6 weeks. This is consistent with findings of Odum and De la Cruz (1967) who reported that a major portion of dead marsh grass biomass was broken down to particulate matter in the first month of decomposition and that the remainder was acted upon more slowly. In the present study, since all of the ratoon component was alive at flooding and remained viable until freezing temperatures occurred 5-6 weeks post-flood, most of the biomass lost during the first 6 weeks consisted of the stubble and straw component in both systems. All of the sorghum straw and stubble decomposed during this period, whereas only 61% (1991/3293 kg/ha) of the rice straw and stubble entered the detrital system (Table 2). However, the absolute amounts of straw and stubble loss during this period were similar (2227 and 1991 kg/ha for sorghum and rice, respectively).<br />The divergence of residue retention rates between 6 and 12 weeks post-flood was a function of component composition at flooding. Once the significantly larger sorghum ratoon component succumbed to freezing temperatures, large amounts of biomass became available to microbial populations, and decay commenced. In effect, sorghum biomass, initially consisting of two significantly large components, entered the initial and rapid stages of decomposition in two distinct pulses. Rice, with a much smaller ratoon component, did not<br /><br />r100<br />90<br />80 i<br /><br />SORGHUM<br /><br />O6 WEEKS POST-FLOOD<br />Fig. 2.

In 1985-1986, both rice-pond (2579 kg/ha) and sorghum-pond (2606 kg/ha) crayfish yields exceeded 1986-1987 production (1796 and 1840 kg/ha, respectively) by about 30%, paralleling Louisiana yield trends for the same years. Although weighted by the lower 1986 production, 2-year average yields exceeding 2100 kg of crayfish/ha are nearly three times the statewide commercial average (Anonymous, 1986). Mean daily weight of crayfish captured per trap, over both seasons, was 392 g in sorghum ponds and 386 g in rice ponds. Since total vegetative DM and D.O. regimes were similar in both years, yearly differences in crayfish production appear to have been primarily influenced by uncontrollable environmental and climatic conditions, rather than forage substrates.<br />Brunson and Taylor (1987) suggested that grain sorghum might provide an alternative to rice as an agronomic crayfish forage. The present study established that grain sorghum can be effectively double cropped with crayfish, and that satisfactory yields can be simultaneously achieved from both crops. Acceptance of grain sorghum as an alternative to rice will provide farmers with an additional opportunity to diversify their agricultural operations. In past years, when rotating land from rice to an upland crop (traditionally soybeans in Louisiana), crayfish production was not feasible during the upland rotation. This was primarily because soybean stubble does not provide adequate forage<br /><br />272<br />substrate to sustain crayfish production (Day, 1983). Use of grain sorghum, however, allows production of crayfish even during the “off-year”, generating an additional cash crop that would otherwise not be produced.<br />Under current economic conditions, farmers experience increasing pressures to optimize productivity and maximize returns from cultivation efforts. The integration of crayfish production with traditional agriculture may facilitate such accomplishments, and the development of a grain sorghum-crayfish double cropping system can increase available management options.<br /><br /></p>; <p>References: (1986) Louisiana Summary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, p. 200. , Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service, Louisiana Stage University, Baton Rouge, LA, Anonymous; <br/>Rice Production Handbook (1987) Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Publication 2321, p. 63. , Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, Anonymous;<br/>Brunson, Pre-flood evaluation of seven grasses (Graminae L) as planted forage for crawfish (1987) Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 18 (3), pp. 186-189;<br/>Brunson, Linscombe, Selection and managment of rice for crawfish (1987) Crawfish Tales, 6 (1), pp. 10-13;<br/>Brunson, Taylor, Evaluation of three sorghums as alternative forages for crawfish (1987) Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 18 (4), pp. 247-252;<br/>Brunson, Taylor, Hoff, Characteristics of rice cultivars with implications for crawfish double cropping (1988) J.

We examined production and senescence of leaf area for six grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) hybrids ranging from 'temperate' to 'tropical'. They were commercial hybrids RS610 and DeKalb E57 +, and four hybrid crosses of 'tropically' adapted lines AT × 623 and RT × 430 and 'temperately' adapted lines AT × 378 and RE × 16-6. All hybrids were grown in the field with adequate moisture and fertility. Leaf areas produced and senesced were measured weekly. Green leaf area index (lai) was defined as lai = lait - lais, where lait was the total lai produced and lais was the lai senesced. Progressions of lait and lais with thermal time after emergence (T = Σ (daily average temperature-8); °C) were described by logistic equations. One coefficient of that form of equation defines the intrinsic rate of exponential increase and the other relates to thermal time to onset of exponential increase. The fitted coefficients were compared among hybrids by analyses of covariance. Intrinsic rates of lai production did not differ significantly among hybrids. However, hybrids had compensating differences in leaf size and distribution of lait between main culms and tillers. Hybrids with a lower percentage of lait on tillers grew larger leaves on main culms. Times to onset of exponential increase in lait differed significantly among hybrids, but were not related to adaptation. Hence, lait during early development was more important than intrinsic production rate for discriminating among hybrids in lai production. Intrinsic rates of senescence differed significantly among hybrids but, although hybrids from the 'temperately' adapted RE×16-6 had lowest senescence rate, difference were not consistently related to adaptation. Percentage of leaves senesced, rather than distribution of senesced lais between main culms and tillers, accounted for senescence differences among hybrids. Hybrid differences in lai duration related closely to differences in lai senescence. Hence, hybrid effects on lai senescence were greater in magnitude than effects on lai production. It is unlikely that differences in leaf area production and senescence account for yield differences between 'temporately' and 'tropically' adapted hybrids. However, knowing the differences among hybrids in leaf area attributes may be useful in crop management and plant breeding.","1987","2015-06-03 04:12:57","2015-06-03 20:43:06","","305-317","","3-4","17","","Field Crops Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","<p>Cited By :20</p>; <p>CODEN: FCRED</p>; <p>Correspondence Address: Hammer, G.L.; Agriculture Branch, Queensland Department of Primary Industries, G.P.O.

Moench) hybrids with diverse ad-<br />aptations have been developed in many countries. The so-called 'tropically' adapted (TR) sorghum hybrids were developed recently from the World Sorghum Collection (Miller, 1982 ). Compared with 'temperately' adapted (TE) sorghums, which mature earlier, tiller less, and are shorter, the TR hybrids yielded more in tropical environments, and the same in temperate environments (Creelman et al., 1979; Miller, 1982; Miller and Kebede, 1984; Wade, 1986).<br />Several studies have examined leaf area of TR and TE hybrids. Gerik and Miller (1984), who reported differences in photoperiod and temperature effects on phenology and leaf area development, found that TR hybrids altered their phenology and growth to maximize their leaf area over a wide range of environmental conditions. Duncan et al. (1981) reported more green leaves, greater leaf area indexes (LAI), and longer leaf durations for TR lines, which they described as nonsenescent. These studies suggest that yield differences between TR and TE sorghum hybrids may be explained by differences in crop leaf area and its duration.<br />Arkin et al. (1983) pooled data from various experiments and developed a simulation model of sorghum leaf area. In one experiment comparing four TR and WE hybrids and lines, leaf durations did not differ significantly. While that seems to contradict Duncan et al. (1981), different sets of sorghum lines were used. So some, but not all, TR and TE hybrids may differ in rate of leaf area senescence. Arkin et al. (1983) did not report comparisons of rates of leaf area production. Nelson (1986) conducted several experiments on two TE sorghum hybrids and developed a simulation model of leaf growth. After allowing for phenology differences, rates of leaf area production differed little between hybrids.<br />The studies cited above examined leaf area at the individual-plant level. Whilst the components examined can be integrated to the crop level, as by Arkin et al. (1983) and Nelson (1986), initial study at the crop level is simpler. If differences are found, then explanations can be sought at the individualplant level. At the crop level, LAI is determined by phenology, rate of LAI production, and rate of LAI senescence. Also, at the crop level, LAI duration is defined as the time difference between LAI production and senescence. None of the studies cited above compared rates of LAI production and senescence among hybrids at the crop level. Those rates may differ among hybrids and<br /><br />307<br />thus contribute to LAI differences independently of phenology effects. In that way, they may contribute to yield differences between TR and TE sorghum hybrids. Hence, we tested a set of diverse grain sorghum hybrids for differences in their LAI production and senescence rates, and thus, their LAI durations.<br />MATERIALSAND METHODS<br />Field experiment<br />The data reported here were collected on a subset of material from an experiment on planting-time effects on phenology of diverse grain sorghum hybrids. The phenology data are not reported here. For the phenology experiment, we planted twelve grain sorghum hybrids monthly from January 1983 to March 1984, except for November 1983, at Gatton Research Station, Queensland, Australia (latitude 27 °33' S, longitude 152 °20' E ) in a split-plot design with three replications. Planting times were randomly allocated to main plots and hybrids to sub-plots. Each sub-plot was three rows, 1 m apart, and 3 m long. We thinned sub-plots to 50 000 plants per ha shortly after emergence. The soil was a dark, moderately self-mulching, cracking, medium clay classified as a black earth (Powell, 1982). We applied a complete fertilizer mix at planting (amounts of N, P, K, S, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, B and Mo were 48, 50, 50, 58, 15, 10, 10, 10, 1 and 0.1 kg ha -1, respectively), sidedressed with N at 150 kg ha -1 at appearance of leaf eight (L8) and shortly after panicle initiation, and sprinkler-irrigated about every two weeks in the absence of adequate rainfall. This ensured that neither nutrients nor water limited crop growth. Insect pests and weeds were controlled as required and leaf diseases were monitored. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures were measured at a standard meteorological station near the experimental site.<br />We conducted this study on one replicate of the 13 January 1984 planting, by selecting six hybrids with diverse adaptations (Table 1) and tagging five plants in the central rows of the relevant sub-plots shortly after they had emerged. At approximately weekly intervals, we measured the main culm and all tillers of the tagged plants for: (i) number of fully expanded leaves (i.e., leaves with ligules visible); (ii) length (mm) of all leaves not fully expanded at the previous measurement; and (iii) senescence of all leaves, using a fivepoint scale (0--no senescence; 1= &lt;25%; 2=26-50%; 3=51-75%; 4 = &gt; 75% of leaf area senesced).<br />On the main culm of each tagged plant, we recorded plant development by noting when: (i) leaf 8 was fully expanded; (ii) anthers were exserted from florets half-way down the panicle (i.e., 50% anthesis); and (iii) seeds had formed a black layer (Eastin et al., 1973 ) in the lower part of the panicle (i.e., physiological maturity).<br />To derive the relationships we needed to convert leaf length to leaf area, we<br /><br />308<br /><br />harvested five plants of each hybrid, from an area adjacent to the experiment, on three occasions: when the 5th, the 9th, and the flag leaves on the main culms were fully expanded. We removed all leaf blades from the main culms and tillers, numbered them, measured their lengths, and determined their areas with an electronic, belt-driven, leaf-area meter.<br /><br />Data analyses<br /><br />Predicting leaf area from leaf length. For each hybrid, we plotted two graphs of<br />leaf area (LA ) against leaf length (LL ), one for leaves on main culms and one for leaves on tillers. To those data we fitted curvilinear functions of the form<br /><br />LA = aLL b<br /><br />(1)<br /><br />where a and b were fitted coefficients,then tested those functions for similarity among main culms, tillers, and hybrids using analyses of covariance.<br /><br />Defining components of LAI. Green leaf area index (LAI ) can be defined as<br /><br />LAI ----L A I t - - LAI s<br /><br />(2)<br /><br />where LAItis the total LAI produced and LAIs is the LAI senesced. We analysed the components LAIt and LAIs separately.<br /><br />Leaf area production. Using the predictive equations developed, we converted<br />leaf lengths to leaf areas and accumulatedthem to find total leaf area produced by the five plants of each hybrid at each measurement, expressed as total leaf area index ( LAIt) by dividing the leaf area by the ground area occupied by the five plants.<br />We plotted LAIt for each hybrid against accumulated thermal time (T) after<br />emergence. Thermal time was calculated as T= X ( ( Tmax+ Train)/2- Tb),<br />where Tmaxand Trainwere daily maximum and minimum temperatures and Tb was base temperature, which was taken as 8°C for all hybrids. Alagarswamy et al. (1986) reported this base temperature for leaf appearance in sorghum. Arkin et al. (1983) used 7 °C in their sorghum leaf model and Nelson (1986) found a base temperature of 10 °C gave best fit to his data on leaf appearance rate. However, Nelson (1986) also found little change in goodness of fit for base temperatures in the range reported (i.e. 7-10 °C).<br />To the data on LAIt and T we fitted logistic equations of the form<br /><br />LAIt----Lmax/(1 + apexp ( -- bpT))<br /><br />(3)<br /><br />where L~a~ was the maximum LAIt reached and % and bp were fitted coefficients. The equation was transformed to a linear form and then linear regressions fitted to determine the coefficients. Leaf area production rate is given by the derivative of Eqn. (3) :<br /><br />309<br /><br />dLAIt/dT=bpLAIt (Lm~x- LAIt)/Lm~x).<br /><br />(4)<br /><br />This equation shows that leaf area production rate is linearly related to both LAIt and the proportional disparity of LAIt from Lmax. Hence, the coefficient b, represents the intrinsic leaf area production rate; it determines steepness of exponential increase in LAIt. The coefficient % determines time to onset of exponential increase in LAIt. We compared fitted coefficients among hybrids using analysis of covariance, and to interpret this comparison, examined leaf sizes and the distribution of leaf area between main culms and tillers.<br /><br />Leaf area senescence. Using the observed senescence ratings and calculated leaf areas, we determined senesced leaf area index (LAIs) similarly to LAIt. As for LAIt, we plotted LAIs against T for each hybrid and fitted logistic equations of the form<br /><br />LAIs----Lmax/(1 + asexp ( -- bsT) ),<br /><br />(5)<br /><br />where as and bs were fitted coefficients. Leaf area senescence rate is given by the derivative of Eqn. (5 ) :<br /><br />dLAIddT=b~aAI~( ( Lmax- LAIs)/nmax ).<br /><br />(6 )<br /><br />Hence, similarly to b, in Eqn. (4), the coefficient b~ represents the intrinsic leaf area senescence rate. It determines steepness of exponential increase in LAIs.The coefficient as determines time to onset of exponential increase in LAIs. We compared fitted coefficients among hybrids using analysis of covariance, and to interpret this comparison, examined number of senesced leaves and the distribution of senesced leaf area between main culms and tillers. We calculated LAI durations from the time differences between production and senescence, and compared them among hybrids.<br /><br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br /><br />Daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the duration of the experiment are given in Fig. 1. Effects of temperature variation were removed by using thermal time (T) in the analysis.<br /><br />Predicting leaf area from leaf length<br /><br />Coefficients of Eqn. (1) fitted to predict leaf area (LA ) from leaf length (LL ) differed significantly for main-culm and tiller leaves, probably because mainculm leaves were wider.

For each hybrid, total leaf area index produced (aAIt) was plotted against T after emergence (Fig. 2 ). Maximum LAIt attained (Lmax) was associated with duration of vegetative growth and leaf number (Table 1 ). Because measurements were not replicated, statistical comparisons were precluded.<br />All hybrids showed the curvilinear pattern characteristic of the logistic equation (Eqn. (3)) and fitted the linear form of that equation with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. Hybrids did not differ significantly for intrinsic leaf area production rate, bp (Table 1 ), but they differed significantly for the parameter %. Parameter bp determines steepness of the exponential growth curve and % determines time to onset of exponential growth. Differences among hybrids in specific leaf area or partitioning of dry matter between roots and tops during early seedling growth may have caused differences in %. Hammer (unpublished data) found specific leaf area and partitioning differences among some of these sorghum hybrids.<br />We examined the meaning and usefulness of differences in % by calculating the thermal time to reach LAIt of 0.1, using the fitted equations (Table 1 ).

Their intrinsic rates of leaf area production (bp) did not differ from the others, but delay in onset of exponential increase in LAIt decreased their LAItat 450 degree-days after emergence by about 0.5 compared to other hybrids with similar Lm,x (Fig. 2). This effect was not associated with either parental line alone (i.e., ATX378 or REX 16-6) because it did not occur in other hybrids involving either of those lines.<br />Wells and Meredith (1986) found that cotton (Gossypiumhirsutum) hy-<br />brids and their parent lines differed in LAI production in the same way. They showed that time to onset of exponential growth, rather than the exponential growth rate itself, caused the differences. Hence, LAIt during early development appears to be an important factor for discriminating among genotypes in leaf area production.<br />Although b, values did not differ among hybrids in this study, they distributed their LAIt between main culms and tillers in different ways (Table 2). Hybrids formed with RE X 16-6 produced few tillers and had a low percentage of their LAIt on tillers. The opposite was true for RS610 and DeKalb E57 + . To maintain the same b,, those differences were compensated by leaf size differences (Fig. 3).

This indicates that, although senescence rates differed among hybrids, low rates were not necessarily associated with tropical or temperate adaptation.<br />Despite numerous sprayings around time of flowering, sorghum midge ( Contarinia sorghicola) infested all hybrids and grain-set was reduced. Slight to<br />moderate damage occurred but it differed little among hybrids. Hence, it was unlikely to have caused hybrid differences in senescence. But it may have affected the magnitude of bs because, with reduced grain-set senescence might<br />be delayed, making b~ lower than otherwise expected. Leaf rust (Pucciniapurpurea) infected all hybrids, but only to a minor extent and late in the grain-<br />filling period. Hence, it probably affected leaf senescence little. Significance tests on as, the time to onset of exponential increase in LAIs,<br />were not appropriate because slopes (i.e., b~) of the linear form of the logistic equation (Eqn. (5 ) ) differed significantly, so testing intercepts (i.e., In (1/as)) became redundant. However, we examined the impact of hybrid differences in all coefficients by calculating durations of the first 0.1 and 0.5 units of LAI produced (Table 3 ) from differences between the equations found for LAIt and LAI s (i.e. Eqns. (3) and ( 5 ) ) . LAI of hybrids formed with RE X 16-6 persisted longer. Hence, although hybrids differed in LAIt via differences in time to onset of exponential increase (ap), LAI duration responded predominately to the larger differences among hybrids in LAIs affected by bs.<br />Phenology differences among hybrids (Fig. 2) confounded this analysis of LAI duration and senescence. However, it would be expected that phenology might affect as, not b~, because thermal time to flowering would relate more to time to onset of senescence than to its intrinsic rate. Furthermore, phenology differences were too small to account for hybrid effects on LAI duration. Hence, phenology differences alone did not cause the observed differences among hybrids in LAI duration and senescence.<br /><br />315<br /><br />TABLE4<br /><br />Attributesofsenescedleafareaat physiologicalmaturityofsix grainsorghumhydrids<br /><br />Hybrid<br /><br />Main culm<br />LAI s<br /><br />Tiller LAIs<br /><br />No. of l e a v e s :~<br /><br />Leaves senesced<br /><br />No. %~ No. %2<br /><br />AT× 623/RT× 430<br /><br />1.03 61.3 1.18 47.8 18.0<br /><br />AT × 378/RT × 430<br /><br />1.26 73.7 1.32 75.4 18.0<br /><br />AT × 623/RE × 16-6<br /><br />0.79<br /><br />46.5<br /><br />0.44<br /><br />37.0<br /><br />16.0<br /><br />AT ×378/RE X 16-6 0.78 42.4 0.51 31.5 17.8<br /><br />RS610<br /><br />1.05 97.2 1.71 92.4 15.0<br /><br />DeKalb E57+<br /><br />1.16 87.2 1.49 71.3 16.0<br /><br />JLAls on main culm expressed as a percentage of LA1 t on main culm. 2LAI~ on tillers expressed as a percentage of LAb on tillers. :~Refers only to the m a i n culm. 4Number of leaves senesced expressed as a percentage of number of leaves.<br /><br />No. %<br />13.2 73.3 13.8 76.7 10.6 66.3 11.2 62.9 15.0 100.0 15.0 93.8<br /><br />We examined the components of LAIs at physiological maturity (Table 4 ) to determine how hybrids differed in senescence. Hybrids distributed LAIs between main culms and tillers similarly. Except for AT× 378/RT × 430, which had the largest number of non-fertile tillers (Table 2), all hybrids had lower senescence percentage on tillers than on main culms. This was consistent with the slightly later development of tillers. Percentage of leaves senesced differed among hybrids in a similar manner to b~. Hence, discriminating among genotypes in leaf area senescence might be achieved simply by observing total and senesced leaf number.<br /><br />Implications<br /><br />Hybrid differences in LAI production and senescence were not related to adaptation, so it is unlikely that they would explain yield differences between TE and TR grain sorghum hybrids. However, this experiment compared the hybrids in only one environment and with no water or nutrient limitation. Further studies are needed to determine hybrid responses to other environments and stress levels. This study provided a useful, simple framework and a reference set of coefficients for such studies.<br />The differences found among hybrids might be exploited to better match the crop to its environment. In instances such as anticipated water shortage, delayed LAI production might be favoured, so a hybrid with high ao might be preferred. Manipulating stand density would achieve a similar result, but different densities would be required to achieve similar levels of LAI production for hybrids differing in %. In situations with adequate water, hybrids with low<br /><br />316<br />ap and thus rapid LAI development might be preferred to achieve maximum light interception.<br />The impact of hybrid differences in leaf-area senescence is not clear. Major effects occur during late grain-fill so differences in grain size might be expected, with hybrids having low bs producing larger grain because they retain their leaf area longer. But the differences might be associated solely with hybrid perenniality and so affect grain size little. The connection between low senescence rate and perenniality is supported by evidence showing more tillering by nonsenescent types in ratooned sorghum (Duncan et al., 1980) and by data indicating that nonsenescenttypes accumulate more carbohydrates in the culm towards the end of the grain-fillingperiod (McBee et al., 1983). Further work is required to clarify the impact of senescence differences before appropriate response types can be defined for given environments.<br />If desirable attributes in leafarea production and senescencewere identified, then field screening could be achieved simply by monitoring early leaf-area growth for differences in ap and by observing percentage of leaves senesced for differences in bs.<br />ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br />We thank the Queensland Graingrowers Association and the Central Queensland Grain Marketing Board for assisting financially, the staff at Gatton Research Station for assisting with field operations, and Dr. R.L.

Moench]from tall, late-maturing, and photoperiod-sensitive genotypes to short, early-maturing, and photoperiod-insensitive genotypes has contributed valuable genetic resources for pest resistance and yield capability (11). The conversion program concentrated on temperately adapted (TE) genotypes until additional refinement of the program resulted in development of tropically adapted (TA) types (10). The sorghum matured later, were taller, had larger stem diameters, tillered more, had larger leaf area indices and leaf area durations, and maintained higher leafblade chlorophyll and basal stem-sugar contents than TE sorghum (3). Thomas (12) showed that TAsorghum have lower base germination temperatures than TE sorghum. Gerik and Miller (8) determined that hybrids have the ability to alter their phenological development and subsequent plant growth to maximize their leaf area under a wider range of environmental conditions than TE hybrids. A detailed explanation concerning the temperate/tropical adaptation characteristic is provided by Mannet al. (9). Tropically adapted sorghums have consistently produced higher yields than TE sorghums, particularly under tropical or subtropical conditions (3, 8, 12).

Temperately adapted sorghums mature much earlier when moved south and this results in substantial reductions in growth and yield.<br />With long growing seasons (+ 230 days) and the need for multiple cropping alternatives, ratoon cropping (two<br />or more harvests from a single planting) has been investigated in some areas of the southern USA(2, 4,<br />6). Several agronomic parameters have been studied,<br />including insect problems (4, 7, 13), fertility aspects (13), weed control problems (1), hybrid maturity fects (2, 6), and tiller regrowth(5).<br />The objective of this study was to compare planted crop and ratooned crop grain yields of TA and TE<br />hybrids in a subtropical environment.<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br /><br />The study was conducted from 1981 to 1983in the upper<br /><br />Coastal Plain region in SumterCounty(near Plains), Geor-<br /><br />gia.

The ratio of ratooned- to planted-crop grain yield was higher for TE hybrids than for TA hybrids. The contribution of the ratoon<br />crop to total combined yields (index) revealed that both types of hybrids produced about 30%of their total yield on the ratooned crop, with the TE hybrids being slightly higher. Consequently, the tropical or temper-<br />ate adaptability characteristic apparently did not influence the ratoon capability of the sorghum hybrids. However, performance of individual hybrids within each group was quite variable.<br />The range in days to 50% anthesis was from 71 to 76 for the planted crop and from 50 to 55 for the ratooned crop (Table 3). Savanna 5 and DK 788 were among the taller hybrids for both crops while ML13 5, Paymaster DR 1085, and Pioneer Brand 8311 were among the shortest. Test weights ranged from 712 for Funk G-516BR to 767 kg m~3 with Pioneer Brand 8311 for the planted crop. Funk G-516BR had one of<br />the lowest test weights on the ratooned crop while Coker 7737 had one of the highest. Savanna 5, Coker 7737, and Pioneer Brand 8311 had high test weights on both crops. Hybrids DK 788, WAC 715 DR, and GSA 1180 had high test weights on the ratooned crop when grain filling occurred during cooler temperatures than for the planted crop.<br />Savanna 5 (TE) and DK 788 (TA) were among the highest yielding hybrids for planted crop, ratooned crop, and total yields (Table 4). The yield of the ratooned crop for Savanna 5 was 66% of the planted crop or almost 40% of the total yield. Several hybrids<br /><br />(W840DR, WAC715DR,W839DR, WAC710DR, Oro<br />Txtra, Funk G-516BR, Penngrain YE) produced high yields on the planted crop, but relatively low yields on the ratooned crop and were evidently better adapted to early season environmental conditions. Additionally, hybrids such as Funk G-522DR, Funk G-611, and Paymaster DR 1085 produced extremely low ratoon yields and were probably not adapted to late season<br />environmental conditions. Ratoon cropping is apparently a quite complex sys-<br />tem and a number of environmental (temperature, moisture) and genetic factors (disease resistance, nonstructural carbohydrate partitioning, insect resistance, but exclusive of temperate or tropical adaptation) were governing the hybrid responses. Ideally, high planted-<br />crop and high ratooned-crop yields would provide more stable production with this double-cropping alterna-<br />tive; however, all grain hybrids in the USA were developed for a single harvest. Consequently, these hybrids are not well adapted to ratoon cropping and until<br />improved grain hybrids have been developed for this<br />purpose, adoption of this double-cropping practice will be limited.<br /><br /></p>","","","full text added; relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found that a short-season mungbean (Vigna radiata) crop could be taken before the commonly-grown castor crop but that castor yields were reduced by the delayed sowing. If the castor was sown after the harvest of mungbean in a sequential system the profits were less than from a sole castor system. Relay-sowing the castor 20 days before the harvest of mungbean gave 9 $US ha""1 greater profit than sole castor, but this is probably not enough to justify the more intensive double crop system. On the other hand a reasonable yield of horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) could be produced after an early pearl millet crop, giving a worthwhile extra profit of 21 $US ha""1 compared with sole pearl millet. Ratooning the sorghum gave ratoon yields that averaged only 14% of the first crop, so this system was not considered suitable for these lighter Alfisols.<br />Intercropping systems of pearl millet/groundnut, sorghum/pigeonpea and groundnut/ pigeonpea gave average yield increases of 24, 47 and 46%, respectively, compared with both component crops grown separately. Compared with growing only the higher value sole crop, increases in profits were 16, 82 and 120 $US ha~l for the same three systems, respectively. It is concluded that intercropping systems provide the best opportunity for increasing cropping intensity on medium-deep Alfisols.<br />Alfisols (red soils) are the third most important soil order in the world, covering 13.1% of the total land area (Burnigh, 1982). In India alone, where they are shallow to medium in depth, the Alfisols occupy 59.6 million hectares. Clay content increases with depth and the subsoil is usually compact and interspersed with murram (El-Swaify et al., 1983). Water holding capacity is small, varying from 50 to 150 mm according to depth. Thus there is little residual soil moisture for crop growth after the end of the rains and in semi-arid areas there are frequent within-season droughts.<br />In the Indian semi-arid tropics (SAT) the common Alfisol crops are sorghum, pearl millet, groundnut, pigeonpea and castor; these may be grown either as sole crops or in various intercropping systems. The traditional cereal varieties tend to be fairly long season, maturing after the end of the rains and making at least some use of residual soil moisture. As the staple food crops, cereals are often the dominant component of intercropping combinations. Groundnut is commonly a sole crop but is also found intercropped with<br />t ICRISAT Journal Article No. 438. t Present address: School of Development Studies, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, England.<br />0014-4797/85/0000-0980 $05.00© 1985 Cambridge University Press<br /><br />272<br /><br />M.

Pigeonpea is almost invariably intercropped and as a long-season, deep-rooting crop it has the special advantage of utilizing residual moisture, and producing some additional yield, after the harvest of earlier intercrops; but it is usually sparsely sown, so as not to compete too much with the earlier crops, and its yields are low. Castor has a similar role to pigeonpea, especially on shallow soils, but because of its importance as a cash crop it is also commonly grown as a sole crop. Typical yields of unfertilized traditional varieties quoted from on-farm studies are: sorghum 300-500 kg ha""1, millet 300-450 kg ha""1, groundnut 400-600 kg ha""1, pigeonpea 200-300 kg ha""1 and castor 300-550 kg ha""1 (Rastogi et al., 1982; Sanghi and Rao, 1982).<br />Under rainfed conditions on the Alfisols, there is usually thought to be<br />little opportunity for producing much more than the equivalent of a single<br />crop. This paper describes a three-year study which examined the scope for<br />raising cropping intensity either with various 'double' crop systems that incor-<br />porate earlier maturing genotypes, or with improved intercropping systems.<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Experimental site Experiments were conducted at the ICRISAT Centre, about 25 km north-<br />west of Hyderabad (17° N, 500 m elevation), from 1978 to 1981 on medium deep Alfisols which have the physical and chemical characteristics shown in Table 1. These soils are low in nitrogen and available phosphorus but high in potassium.<br /><br />Climatic conditions The rainy season is approximately from mid-June to the end of September<br />and on average 86% of the annual total rain falls during this period. Rainfall is very erratic, with an annual coefficient of variation of 26% (Virmani, 1979); data for the last eight years have shown a variation in total from 320 mm (1972) to 1400 mm (1971).

For sorghum and pearl millet the yields of first crops in ratoon and sequential systems, respectively, were taken as the measure of productivity in sole crop systems; in 1979 the yield of pearl millet in a pearl millet and relay horsegram system was taken as the sole crop pearl millet yield. Because pigeonpea is almost invariably grown as an intercrop, a sole pigeonpea treatment was not included in the first year but thereafter it was included for comparative purposes.<br />Two combinations were tried as sequential systems (where the second crop is sown after the harvest of the first) and as relay systems (where the second crop is sown about three weeks before the harvest of the first): the very hardy horsegram was sown after an early-maturing pearl millet, and a very early mungbean was grown before the traditionally late-sown castor. An early sorghum hybrid was tried in a ratooning system (where the stubble of the first crop is allowed to re-grow to produce a second 'ratoon' crop); although sorghum ratooning is well recognized as a means of producing a low cost second crop on deep soils with good residual moisture supply, no information was available for Alfisols. Unfortunately not all the sequential, relay and ratoon treatments could be accommodated in the last two years (see Table 3).<br />Two intercropping combinations, sorghum/pigeonpea and pearl millet/ groundnut, were examined in all three years; both these combinations had been found promising in more detailed intercropping studies at ICRISAT. Sorghum/pigeonpea is one of the most common 'temporal' combinations in India, the sorghum occupying the rainy season and the pigeonpea making much of its growth on the residual soil moisture left after the sorghum harvest. In this treatment the sorghum was an early hybrid and the arrangement was 2 rows sorghum :1 row pigeonpea, with each crop at its full sole crop population; the objective was to maintain a good yield of sorghum, the main crop in the system, while producing a much larger yield of pigeonpea than is achieved from the sparse pigeonpea populations used in local farming practice. The pearl millet/groundnut was grown as a simple replacement treatment in a 1 row pearl millet:3 rows groundnut arrangement where the withinrow spacing for each crop was the same as its sole crop; with this combination the aim was to maintain a good yield of groundnut, an important cash crop, while also producing a worthwhile yield of pearl millet. After the first year, an intercrop of pigeonpea/groundnut was included in a 1 row pigeonpea:5 rows groundnut arrangement; this had additive populations, as with the sorghum/ pigeonpea, in order to produce a good yield of each crop. For all three intercropping combinations both components were sown simultaneously.<br /><br />Experimental design and analysis In each year the experiment was laid out in a randomized block design<br />with three replicates. Yields were not statistically analysed because of the<br /><br />2 7 6 M.S. REDDY AND R. W. WILLEY<br />very different types and amounts of yield produced by the different crops involved. However, gross and net returns were analysed and maximum CVs for any one year were 7.9 and 11.4%, respectively. (Net returns were estimated by deducting actual experimental inputs for seed, fertilizer and pesticide costs but the small plots did not allow estimates of land preparation and labour costs).<br />Returns were based only on seed yields because of difficulties in valuing some of the crop by-products (e.g. groundnut haulms for fodder and pigeonpea stalks for fuel). This underestimation of total crop value would be greatest for the sorghum crop where straw can add up to 15-20% on gross returns.<br />Routine procedures Crop cultivars were the same in all years (Table 2). The early maturing<br />crops of mungbean, pearl millet, sorghum and groundnut matured about 70, 85, 95 and 110 days after sowing, respectively. The late maturing crops of castor and pigeonpea matured in about 150 and 190 days, respectively. First crops were sown during the last week of June each year, just after the onset of the rains. In all three years initial establishment of all crops was satisfactory.<br />The experiments were conducted in small-scale plots of about 48.6 m2 gross area and 18.9 m2 harvest area. Fertilizer was applied by hand and placed below the soil surface along the side of the crop rows. All sole crops (including both first and second crops of relay and sequential systems) received 18 kg N and 46 kg P2O5 ha""1 as basal fertilizer, and the cereal and castor crops were top dressed with 62 kg N ha""1. The sorghum ratoon crop was only given a topdressing of 40 kg N ha""1. The intercrop plots received the basal fertilizer dressing at the same level as the sole plots. Sorghum in the sorghum/pigeonpea intercrop received a higher N top-dressing per row to give the same overall rate per unit area as the sole sorghum because of the objective of producing a high proportional sorghum yield. Pearl millet in the pearl millet/groundnut intercrop received a N top-dressing at the same rate per row as the sole crop, that is per unit area the intercrop received only one quarter of the N top-dressing of the sole crop. All crops were hand weeded twice during the rainy season and once during the post-rainy season for the late maturing crops and the relay, sequential and ratoon crops. Plant protection measures were used as necessary to control sorghum shootfly (Atherigona soccata), castor semilooper (Achoea janata), pigeonpea pod borer (Heliothis armigera) and groundnut thrips (Frankliniella schultzei).<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Yields for each year are presented in Table 3. For all five crops the sole crop yields were considerably more than typical farm yields, probably because of the improved genotypes and fertilizer application. Sole crop yields were con-<br /><br />Cropping systems for A Ifisols<br /><br />277<br /><br />sistent across years, the maximum variation being a castor yield 20% below the mean in 1978-79.<br />In the double-crop systems where mungbean was grown before castor, mungbean yield ranged from 570 to 634 kg ha""1, which is very good for this short season crop. However, because later sowing caused greater end-of-season drought stress, especially in drier years, castor yields in the double-crop systems were less than the sole crop, and the sequential castor crop yielded less than the relay crop. In the double-crop systems where horsegram followed pearl millet, yields of horsegram were good in the first two years but low in 1980, suggesting an effect of the early cessation of the: rains. In the only year when sequential and relay horsegram could be compared; (1978-79) there was no difference between these two systems, though this was admittedly a heavy rainfall year. For the ratoon sorghum crop yields were only 20 and 8% of the first crop in 1978-79 and 1980-81, respectively; shootfly attack on the ratoon growth was particularly severe in both years, but lack of sufficient residual soil moisture was probably another major factor, as indicated by the virtual failure of the crop in 1980.<br />In the pearl millet/groundnut intercropping system, the groundnut yield averaged 70% of the sole crop, over the three years. Thus despite the fact that it was partially shaded by the pearl millet, the groundnut produced a yield only slightly smaller than the 75% yield 'expected' from its sown proportion. On the other hand, the millet produced an average yield of 54% of the sole crop, more than twice the 25% expected from its sown proportion. This increase over the expected pearl millet yield must have occurred because of an increase in yield per plant, a response that has been attributed elsewhere both to an increase in tillering and head number and to a greater yield from the main stem (Reddy and Willey, 1981). Pearl millet is obviously more competitive than groundnut in this combination and the pearl millet plants were presumably responding to what was effectively a low population of pearl millet. Combining the two crops, this intercropping combination gave a 24% yield advantage, possibly because of more efficient use of intercepted light (Reddy and Willey, 1981) and moisture (Vorasnot. 1982).<br />The sorghum/pigeonpea intercropping combination averaged 82% sorghum and (for the two years in which sole pigeonpea was included) 65% pigeonpea, an advantage of approximately 47% over the three years. Compared with traditional farming practice, which appears to try to preserve a 'full' yield of the staple cereal, there was a sacrifice of 20% in sorghum yield. However, this allowed a very considerable increase in pigeonpea yield. Moreover, because an improved sorghum genotype was used, the 82% sorghum yield of 2080 kg ha""1 was still several times greater than traditional sole crop yields. This sorghum/pigeonpea combination has been examined in more detail on both Vertisols (deep black soils) and Alfisols (Natarajan and Willey, 1981; 1985) and it has been concluded that yield advantages are not due to more efficient use of resources (i.e. more growth per unit of resource used) but to a<br /><br />2 7 8 M. S. REDDY AND R. W. WILLEY<br />complementary use of resources over time. Essentially, the sorghum ensures good use of early resources and the pigeonpea good use of later resources. A similar type of temporal complementarity no doubt occurred in the groundnut/ pigeonpea intercrop, which produced 74% groundnut and 72% pigeonpea, an average of a 46% advantage in the two years in which it was tried. Compared with the sorghum/pigeonpea combination groundnut was obviously a little less competitive than sorghum, resulting in a slightly lower proportional yield of groundnut but a slightly higher proportional yield of pigeonpea.<br />The profitability of these different systems is shown in Fig. 2. Sole crops of groundnut, pigeonpea and castor averaged good returns, mainly by virtue of their large unit value. Sole sorghum was also quite good on average because of its large yield; sole millet averaged rather less than sole sorghum because of a smaller yield and, in 1980-81, a lower price. The mungbean and sequential castor system had no advantage over sole castor, with less profit in 197879 and a similar profit in 1979-80. The mungbean and relay castor was a slightly better system than the sequential one but it was only more profitable than sole castor in 1979-80, and over the three years it gave on average only an extra 9 $US ha""1. It is unlikely that this return would be sufficient to encourage a farmer to try the more intensive double crop system. Moreover, the crop most at risk is the potentially more profitable castor, as shown by its poor yield in 1980-81. Horsegram grown after pearl millet gave a reasonable additional profit compared with sole pearl millet in all three years, averaging an extra 21 $US ha""1. Where pearl millet is the preferred cereal this system could be useful, providing an opportunity for some additional profit without jeopardizing the main crop.<br />In most instances the intercropping systems were more profitable than any of the sole crops; the exception was the pearl millet/groundnut combination, which did not quite exceed the best sole crops in 1978-79 and 198081, essentially because of the relatively small value of its pearl millet component. If these intercropping systems are compared with the same yield proportions of their two components grown as sole crops, the increases in profitability work out at 70 $US ha""1 for sorghum/pigeonpea, 31 $US ha""1 for pearl millet/groundnut, and 142 $US ha""1 for groundnut/pigeonpea. (In percentage terms these increases are exactly the same as those given for yield, i.e. 47, 24 and 46%, respectively). As indicated earlier, however, it may often be more relevant to compare intercropping returns with the main component grown as a sole crop. On this basis sorghum/pigeonpea gave an increased profitability of 82 $US ha""1 (46%) compared with sole sorghum. Similarly, pearl millet/groundnut gave 16 $US ha""1 (8%) more than sole groundnut, though an important feature of this combination is that it produces a reasonable yield of the pearl millet food crop in addition to a good cash crop of groundnut. Groundnut is also traditionally the main crop of the groundnut/ pigeonpea combination, though in recent years pigeonpea has become a high<br /><br />Cropping systems for Alfisols<br /><br />Sole crops<br /><br />Relay, sequential (or) ratoon crops<br /><br />1978-79 i SE (m) Gross returns<br />i SE (m) Net returns<br /><br />200<br /><br />100<br /><br />279<br />Intercrops<br /><br />1979-80 SE (m) Gross returns<br />SE (m) Net returns<br /><br />- 300 - 200 £ 100<br />I 500<br />400 300 200 100<br />0<br /><br />astor round n o rghum lillet igeonpe<br />|ram ^^| Sorghum/Pig eonpea Millet/Groun dnut Pigeoiipea/Giroundn<br /><br />•• o<br /><br />tor<br /><br />S8 to<br /><br />E<br /><br />aq:<br /><br />o<br />C/)<br /><br />2<br /><br />+ + +C<br /><br />c* —I<br />3 |loc|<br /><br />•1980-81<br />SE (m) Gross returns<br /><br />Net monetary returns<br /><br />SE (m) Net returns<br /><br />Gross monetary<br /><br />returns<br /><br />r n•<br /><br />O O en<br /><br />Q.<br /><br />+1 + S ||«t<br />O &lt;0<br /><br />eonpe dnut<br /><br />let/ eon<br /><br />punoj noj<br /><br />•• 3 C c a.

The intercropping systems also offer greater stability because they do not run the same risks of a poor yielding second crop. Even on a deep Vertisol, where sequential cropping is far less risky, a maize/pigeonpea intercropping system gave more stable returns than a maize and sequential chickpea system (Reddy and Willey, 1982). It has also been shown that the probability of net returns falling below any given 'disaster' level is much less for a sorghum/ pigeonpea intercrop than for its constituent sole crops (Rao and Willey, 1980). These stability aspects could not be measured in the present experiments but it was very evident that in 1980-81, when the rains ended early, the sequential and relay systems offered little or no advantage over the sole crops, whereas the intercropping systems were particularly good.<br />Acknowledgements.

Moench, culture double, interaction cultivarendroit de culture, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), Heliothis zea (Boddie)<br /><br />Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a versatile crop which can be grown for grain, forage, silage, sirup and/or sugar production. The crop can be planted over a wide range of climatic as well as soil environments. Because of this versatility,<br />sorghum is readily adaptable to most mul-<br />tiple cropping programs. Since many states<br />in the southeastern U.S.A. have long<br />growing seasons (225+ frost-free days), multiple cropping practices are being adopted. Double-cropping of such warm-<br />season crops as corn, vegetables, tobacco, and sorghum is providing increased reve-<br />nue from the same land during a single<br />growing season. Ratoon cropping is an ad-<br />ditional double-cropping scheme whereby the crop is harvested two or more times from a single planting during the growing<br />season.<br />Sorghum can be ratoon-cropped for grain, forage, or silage (Duncan 1979, 1981, 1983; Plucknett et al. 1970). Var-<br />ious agronomic parameters involving ra-<br />tooned sorghum have been investigated (Escalada and Plucknett 1975a,b, 1911;<br /><br />Prabhakar 197 6; Molina et al. 197'7 ;<br />Touchton and Martin 1981) including weed control (Banks and Duncan 1983; Duncan 1981; Obrien et al. 1916).<br />Sweet sorghum can be grown for either sirup (Coleman 1970; Freeman et al . l9'7 3)<br />or sugar (Broadhead 1973; Coeto and<br />Smith 1974; Sund et al. 1976) production in the U.S.A. In addition, sweet sorghum has potential as a primary alternate source of renewable energy (Reeves et al. 1979; Smith and Reeves 1979, 1981). Informa-<br />tion on the ratoon capability of sweet<br />sorghum is lacking. This study investi-<br />gated the influence of ratoon cropping on green weight, sugar production, and insect damage for several sweet sorghum culti-<br />vars.<br />METHODS AND MATERIALS<br />These experiments were conducted during 1980<br />and 1981 at two locations in Georgia: The<br />Coastal Plain region on a Greenville sandy clay loam soil (Rhodic Paleudult) near Plains (Sumter County) and the Piedmont region on a Cecil sandy loam soil (Typic Hapludult) near Griffin (Pike County).

Generally,<br />the sweet sorghum was planted in early April, initially harvested by early August, and the ratoon crop harvested in mid- to late November.<br />Row spacings were 91 cm at Plains and'76 cm at Griffin. Soil pH ranged from 6.4 at Plains to 5.8 at Griffin. More irrigation water was needed<br />for optimum plant growth at Plains due to the drought-susceptible characteristics of the<br />Greenville soil.<br />Seeding rate was approximately 86 500 seed<br />per hectare at both locations. Plant populations<br />at emergence were not adjusted to unifornr<br />levels since the capability of the various sweet sorghum cultivars to germinate, emerge, and<br />grow in less-than-optimum soil temperature<br />(&lt;18'C) conditions was an important consideration in the study.<br /><br />Fourteen cultivars (Table 2) were planted in<br />three-row plots 5.2 m long and yield, stand<br />counts, and refractometer readings were taken<br />from the center row only. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with<br />three replications.<br />The center row of each three-row plot was<br />harvested at approximately the soft dough stage<br />of development for the first harvest and the soft dough to mid-dough stage for the second har-<br />vest. Cutting height was approximately l2 cm.<br />Several cultivars exhibited some variability in stage of maturity at harvest (i.e. MN 1500 had not reached the soft dough stage at the first har-<br />vest) and, therefore, had not attained a peak in sugar production.

Four sweet<br /><br />sorghum cultivars were selected for comparison<br /><br />with two silage-type commercial sorghum hy-<br /><br />brids (checks). Individual plots were sampled<br />for lepidopteran larvae and rated for damage<br /><br />during the vegetative stage of growth (approx-<br /><br />imately 35 cm height).

Brandes<br /><br />produced the highest whole-plant weights while Ramada produced the lowest on the first crop. MN 1500 had the highest ratoon<br /><br />weights and MN 960, the lowest. Compar-<br /><br />ison of total production (first plus ratoon<br /><br />plant weights) values revealed that MN<br /><br />1500 had the highest while MN 960 and<br /><br />Ramada had the lowest weights. Ratoon<br /><br />plant weights range from 457o (MN 960)<br /><br />to l42%o (Ramada) of the first-crop plant<br /><br />weights. Most of the cultivars produced<br /><br />ratoon plant weights which were 50-807o<br /><br />those of the first crop.

A high RE value indicates that<br />a greater proportion of the total weight was<br />produced by the ratoon crop than the first<br />crop. Ramada and Rio had the highest RE<br />values and in both cultivars, the ratoon<br />yield exceeded the first crop yield. However, total production of these two cultivars was low. Most of the cultivars gave RE values ranging from 35 to 45. Idealistically, an RE value of 50 means that the genotype produced equal weights on the first and ratoon crops, but this value oc-<br />curred only with three of the cultivars<br />(Keller, Rio, and Ramada) which were low in total productivity (except for Keller) in comparison with the other cultivars.<br />Plant height determinations revealed that<br />MN 1500 and Theis were the tallest cultivars in the first crop while MN 960 was the shortest. For the ratoon crop, MN 1500 was the tallest and MN 1054 was the short-<br />est. The ratoon-crop height ranged from 75 to 9l7o of the first crop.<br />Since equal amounts of seed (seed size was similar) were planted and germination<br />rates were similar for all cultivars, the<br />stand counts at harvest in the first crop re-<br /><br />266 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE<br /><br />Can.

Brandes and Dale had the greatest number of plants per plot while MN 960, Ramada, and MN 1056 had the<br />fewest number of plants on the first crop. The stand count of the ratoon crop ind-i-<br />cates tillering capability of the cultivars and indirectly accounts for loss of plants following harvest. Keller and MN 1054 produced the highest number of tillers in the ratoon crop while MN 960 produced<br />the lowest. However, calculation of tiller-<br />ing capacity (ratoon tiller number/first crop plant number) indicated that MN 960 pro-<br />duced an identical plant population on the first and ratoon crops. Wray was the only cultivar to have a lower plant population<br />on the ratoon crop than on the first crop. Brandes, Dale, and MN 1060 maintained similar plant populations on the two crops while the remaining genotypes produced<br />23-74Vo increases in their plant popula-<br />tions.<br />The productivity of the specific sweet<br />sorghum cultivars was different in the<br />Piedmont region (Table 7). Whole-plant green weight comparisons revealed that<br />Brandes, Wray, and Keller produced the<br />highest weights on the first crop and MN 960, MN 1056, and Ramada produced the<br />lowest. Ratoon plant weights varied from<br />a high of 31.7 Mg.ha-'for Wray to a low of 9.0 Mg.ha-t for MN 960. Total plant weight comparisons showed that Wray, Brandes, and Keller had the highest weights while Ramada, MN 960, and MN 1056 had the lowest values. The ratoon<br />weights ranged from 34 to 68Vo of the first-<br />crop weights, with the exception of MN<br />1056 (95Eo) and Ramada (ll7%o). Ratoon efficiency (RE) comparisons showed that<br />all but three cultivars (Roma, MN 1056, and Ramada) produced 32-367o of their<br />total production in the ratoon crop. Brandes<br />produced only 23Vo of its total production in the ratoon crop.<br />Plant height measurements at Griffin re-<br />vealed that Theis was the tallest cultivar in<br /><br />the first crop and MN 1056 was the short-<br />est. On the ratoon crop, Keller was the tallest and MN 1054 was the shortest. Height<br />of the ratoon crop was 6l-817o the height of the first crop for most cultivars; how-<br />ever, Wray was 6Vo taller and MN 1056 was l3Vo taller in the ratoon crop than in<br />the first crop.<br />Keller had the highest plant population<br />on the first and the ratoon crops while MN 960 had the lowest population on both crops. Tillering capacity comparisons revealed that MN 1056 more than doubled<br />its plant population on the ratoon crop over<br />the initial stand count while MN 960 and Ramada exhibited a 50Vo increase in the<br />plant population. However, these three ge-<br />notypes had low stand counts on the initial<br />crop. The plant population in MN 1060<br />decreased in the ratoon crop. The remain-<br />ing 10 cultivars increased ratoon tiller pop-<br />ulations from 4-22Vo over the initial<br />population. Brandes maintained identical populations for both crops. The cultivars<br />were rated for their ability to grow in lessthan-optimum soil conditions (&lt;18'C) for<br />germination and early seedling growth dur-<br />ing April at the Piedmont location. Keller<br />was the best cultivar followed by Dale and<br />Rio, MN 1500, Wray, and Brandes. The<br />remaining cultivars were slow to germinate<br />and seedling vigor was extremely poor. Percent sugar comparisons between<br />Plains and Griffin are presented in Table 8 for each cultivar. At Plains, Roma and Rio produced the highest percent sugar while Brandes and MN 1500 produced the lowest for the first crop. No significant differences were found for sugar concentration on the ratoon crop; however, the<br />percent sugar (across cultivars) was 37Vo higher for the ratoon crop than for the initial crop.<br />The same trend was observed at Griffin<br />where the mean percent sugar concentration of the ratoon crop exceeded the con-<br />centration of the initial crop by 29Vo. Roma<br />produced the highest sugar value while MN 1500 had the lowest on both crops. Dale<br /><br />268 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE<br />2C 6+--N@d606@OOO<br /><br />Can. J. Plant Sci.

Sugar production values<br /><br />were calculated for each cultivar and are<br /><br />shown in Table 8. The calculated yields of<br /><br />sugar at Plains ranged from 0.82 (Ramada)<br /><br />to 2.12 (Roma) and from 0.51<br /><br />M(MgN'ha96' 0o)nttohe2f.i7rs2t<br /><br />crop (MN<br /><br />1500) Mg'ha-r on the ratoon crop. Mean<br /><br />values across cultivars for the two crops<br /><br />were similar at the Coastal Plain location.<br /><br />Roma produced the highest total sugar<br /><br />yield and MN 960 produced the lowest.<br /><br />Sugar yields at Griffin ranged from 0.50<br /><br />(Ramada) to 2.19 (Wray) Mg'ha ' on the<br />first crop and from 0.46 (MN 960) to 1.56<br /><br />(Wray) Mg'ha-l on the ratoon crop. Mean<br /><br />values across cultivars were 0.50 Mg'<br /><br />ha-I higher for the initial crop than for the<br /><br />ratoon crop. Wray produced the highest to-<br /><br />tal sugar yield while MN 960, MN 1056,<br /><br />and Ramada had the lowest production.<br /><br />Sugar production values across cultivars<br /><br />were 0.36 Mg'ha-' higher at Plains than<br /><br />at Griffin for Plains<br /><br />fwoer rtehe0.i8n3itiMalgc'hroap,t<br /><br />and values higher for<br /><br />the ratoon crop than for Griffin. Conse-<br /><br />quently, total ratoon double-cropping sugar yield at Griffin was I . l9 Mg'ha- t less than<br /><br />at Plains. Total sugar production expecta-<br /><br />tions could be increased by improvement<br /><br />in juice extraction efficiency. The 0.45<br /><br />conversion factor used in Table 8 is based<br /><br />on efficiency from a single pass through a<br />roller mill press. If the stalks were<br /><br />squeezed a second time (possibly with in-<br /><br />creased external pressure plus the addition<br /><br />of water), a 0.95 juice extraction efficiency<br />is possible which would increase total<br /><br />sugar production.<br /><br />Two species of phytophagous lepidop-<br /><br />teran larvae were found feeding on the veg-<br />etative-stage foliage of sweet sorghum<br />(Table 9). Corn earworm (Heliothis zea<br /><br />Boddie)) was found on the first crop. Fol-<br /><br />iar damage ratings and number of corn ear-<br /><br />worm larvae were not significantly differ-<br />ent among cultivars. Fall armyworm<br /><br />(Spodopterafrugiperda (J. E.

In addition, number of FAW larvae was significantly lower for Theis than for the other cultivars.<br />When insect counts and damage ratings were combined across cultivars, highly significant differences were detected between the initial crop and the ratoon crop<br />(Table 10). Corn earworm larvae were found solely on the first crop while fall armyworm larvae were damaging only the ratoon crop. Damage ratings were higher on the ratoon crop than on the first crop.<br />This same pattern of damage was observed<br />on sorghum ratooned for grain (Gardner<br />and Duncan 1983).<br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Ratoon cropping of sweet sorghum is an additional double-cropping option for farmers in the southeastern U.S.A. and in<br />areas with similar climatic and edaphic environmental conditions. Proper management is the key to success in this produc-<br />tion program. Climatic conditions<br />(particularly air and soil temperatures during April-May and October-November) are<br />extremely important and will govern the level of productivity of the specific cultivars. In general, the Piedmont location<br />(Griffin) had mean air temperatures which were 1-2oC cooler in the early spring and fall than the Coastal Plain location (plains). Griffin averages about 227 frost-free days per year while Plains averages 232 days (Duncan l98l). Since most sweet sorghum cultivars require approximately I 30-- I 35<br /><br />days from planting to harvest for one crop,<br />ratoon cropping seems, at best, a marginal production scheme. However, the ratoon crop gains 2-3 wk over replanting because the ratoon crop begins immediately from buds on plant stubs which have an estab-<br />lished root system. The first crop should<br />have about 120 days from planting to harvest while the ratoon crop needs 110-120<br />days and will usually be terminated by<br />freezing temperatures. The Piedmont lo-<br />cation has not consistently provided an en-<br />vironment for successful ratoon cropping<br />of sorghum due to late spring and early fall frosts. The sorghum ratoon research program in the Piedmont has been successful approximately 50Vo of the time while the upper Coastal Plains has been 1007o suc-<br />cessful for ratoon double-cropping. Results from this study showed a significant ge-<br />notype X location interaction for most of<br />the characteristics involved in ratoon dou-<br />ble-cropping, i.e. plant weight, height, and sugar production.<br />Sweet sorghum cultivars apparently dif-<br />fer in their adaptability for ratoon cropping. Grain sorghum hybrids (Duncan<br />1979, l98l) as well as parental lines<br />(Duncan et al. 1980) have previously been found to exhibit genetic differences when<br />ratooned. At Plains, Brandes and MN 1500<br />produced high total green plant weights but<br />had low sugar concentrations. Roma had a lower total green plant weight, but a<br />higher sugar concentration in the stem.<br />Consequently, total calculated sugar production was highest for Roma. MN 960<br /><br />Table 10.

Larvae of corn<br /><br />earworm and fall armyworm tend to bur-<br /><br />row into and feed within the whorl of veg-<br /><br />etative-stage sorghum plants, thus making<br /><br />insecticidal control difficult.

However, economic<br /><br />thresholds for these pests on sweet sorghum are undefined. Martin et al. (1980) estab-<br /><br />lished a threshold of one larva per plant for<br /><br />grain sorghum hybrids, but this level ap-<br />pears inadequate for ratooned grain<br /><br />sorghum (Touchton and Martin 1981) and<br /><br />may not be satisfactory for economic con-<br /><br />trol of these larvae on sweet sorghum.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />Sweet sorghum cultivars can be ratoon<br />double-cropped. However, this study addressed only the agronomic and not the economic feasibility of such a production scheme. Since approximately one-fourth of<br />the cost of a sweet sorghum crop is in-<br />curred prior to harvest and the remaining<br />three-fourths are involved in harvesting<br />and processing to the final product, total<br />biomass and sugar production per hectare must be high enough to justify two harvests<br />in comparison with a single crop. As with<br /><br />all sugar-accumulating crops, sweet<br />sorghum has a growth (vegetative) phase<br />followed by an accumulation (reproduc-<br />tive) phase. An early harvest (as exempli-<br />fied by the first harvest in this study) in order to attain two successive crops may<br />provide a reasonable biomass production,<br />but could sacrifice potential sugar produc-<br />tion. In addition, the second harvest re-<br />sulted in low biomass production and high<br />sugar accumulation. Economic considera-<br />tions in commercial production of sweet<br />sorghum would probably necessitate both high biomass and high sugar production from both crops to justify ratoon cropping<br />in comparison with a well-managed single<br />crop. These comparisons are essential before any judgments on the actual value of ratoon cropping of sweet sorghum can be<br />made.<br />Several assumptions were made when<br />calculating total sugar production. The<br />0.70 conversion factor for estimating stalk production from total whole-plant green weights is an approximate figure for mature sweet sorghum. The value can vary widely among cultivars and could have been lower for the immature sorghum in the study, particularly on the first crop. Similarly, the conversion of refractometer readings to percent sugar in the juice extracts may have been quite variable for immature sweet sorghum. The ratio of non-<br />sugar solids to sugars decreases with<br />maturity, i.e. the purity increases. Consequently, the calculations would provide only very rough estimations of total sugar<br />production for the immature sweet sorghum cultivars, such as MN 1500, and may not<br />reflect production potential. In addition,<br />the sugar readings may have been conserv-<br />ative estimates of the actual sugar concen-<br />tration in the plant since the sugar content is frequently lower in the basal internodes of the stalk in comparison to the upper in-<br />ternodes during reproductive growth<br />stages.<br />A combination of plant characteristics is essential to maximize sweet sorghum ra-<br /><br />DUNCAN AND GARDNER - YIELD AND INSECT DAMAGE OF RATOON CROPS, SWEET SORGHUM 273<br /><br />Can.

In many of these areas, however, low rainfall and other environmental factors during specific seasons often prohibit continuous cropping throughout the year. In semitropical regions such as the southeastern USA, there are sufficient frost-free days (240 to 300), heating degree units (4,000 to 5,000), and rainfall to produce two warm-season grain crops each year.

Exceptionally wet or dry soil conditions during this period often delay planting of the second crop and increase probability of frost kill before maturity. With ratooning grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), this interval is eliminated and extreme weather conditions become less important to the second crop. Nevertheless, information on ratooning sorghum production in semitropical regions is limited. Duncan (1979) reported on the potential of ratooning grain sorghum production in the southeastern USA and emphasized the importance of variety selection.<br />Plucknett et al. (1970) reviewed ratooning grain sorghum research conducted in Hawaii, India, and Australia; however, environmental conditions di [fer considerably from those in the southeastern USA. Ejca-<br />cplada and Plucknett (1975) ointed out the effects of<br />daylength, temperature, an their interactions on tillering and plant development of ratooning sorghiim. Escalada and Plucknett (1977) reported that N applications increased the number of productive tillers, panicle size, grain number per panicle, panicle weight, and stover and grain yield of ratooning sorghum. They predicted that 200 to 250 kg N/ha were necessary for high yield. On their first ratooning crop, grain yield ranged from 1,798 kg/ha without supplemental h to 2,829 kg/ha when 250 kg N/ha was applied.<br />When the late summer and early fall temperature is below normal, the ratooning crop may not reach physiological maturity before a killing frost; thus, yield can be severely reduced. Any production practice that could be used to hasten maturity would be desirable. Sotomayor-Rios and Lugo-Lopez (1978) reported that the application of 56 kg/ha N decreased the growth period to mid-flowering of first crop grain sorghum by 6 days when compared with no N. However, Escalada and Plucknett (1977) found that N applications exceeding 200 kg/ha delayed heading and<br />harvest of ratooning sorghum 4 to 6 days.<br />Nitrogen levels in the leaves at the mid-flowering to soft dough stage can be used as an indicator to help determine i f the N supply was sufficient during the growing season. Hipp and Gerard (1971) reported a sharp decrease in grain yield when leaf N levels of the bloom stage dropped below 2%. Brawand and Hossner (1976) reported a significant correlation betueen half-bloom leaf N and grain yield. The correlation varied among years and ranged from 0.465 to 0.'747.<br />The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of applied N on the production of ratooning grain sorghum grown with and without scheduled insectilcide application.<br /><br />298<br /><br />TOUCHTON &amp; MARTIN: RATOONING GRAIN SORGHUM<br /><br />299<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br /><br />(21 November) and a t maturity in 1978 (7 November).

The continued increase in grain yield as applied N exceeded 44 kg/ha may have been due to a positive correlation between applied N and maturity. Average seed weight of the ratooned crop suggests that the early November frost in 1977 stopped dry matter accumulation within the grain prior to normal physiological maturity. Average weight of the seed planted in April was 2.7 g/100 seed. Average grain weight from the ratooned crop in 1977 ranged from 1.32 to 1.72 g/100 seed and increased as N rates increased (y = 1.33 + 0.0073N - 3.4 x 10~5N2). There are reports in the literature that suggest relationships between soil fertility levels and maturity. Sotomayor-Rios and Lugo-Lopez (1978) reported that time to midflowering decreased as N rates increased and Roy and Wright (1973) reported that<br />rate of dry matter accumulation was higher in fertilized than unfertilized plants.<br />Leaf N in 1978 (Fig. 1) reached a maximum level of 2.0% at the applied N rate of 67 kg/ha. Grain yield (Fig. 2) also reached a maximum at this N level when insecticides were applied. However, when insecticides were not applied, there was no yield response to applied N. Weight per hundred seed in 1978 averaged 2.22 and 2.91 g for the insecticide-treated and untreated areas, respectively, but did not respond to applied N.<br />Higher yield and lower weight per hundred seed obtained when insecticides were applied suggested that there were more seed per head in the treated area.<br />Phytophagous insect infestations, particularly fall armyworms, [Spodoptera frugiperda (]. E. Smith)]<br />were high in 1977 in plots not sprayed with methomyl. Methomyl adequately controlled the phytophagous insects in the insecticide-treated area. In 1978, the phy-<br />tophagous insect populations were not great in the insecticide-treated or untreated areas. The only insects which were found in significant numbers in both years were fall armyworms, corn ear worms [Heliothis zea (Boddie) ], and sorghum webworms [Celama sorghiella (Riley)] and lady beetles (large predacious coccinellids).<br />Insect counts indicated that none of the species were at defined economic densities in 1978. However, the insecticide treatments were apparently timely and sup-<br />pressed a combination of pests that were at sub-economic levels when considered as single species. Yield differences between insecticide treatments (Fig. 2) suggest that low insect populations may be damaging to a crop with only a short period to produce fruit under sub-optimum conditions. Also, the DeKalb BR-54 was developed for spring planting and not for<br />ratooning; therefore, it may be more susceptible to insect damage during growth in late summer and early<br />fall.<br /><br />Grain yield from the planted sorghum crop averaged<br />6,586 kg/ha in 1978. First crop grain yield was not recorded in 1977 but calculations using total dry matter yield suggest that grain yield would have averaged<br />approximately 6,000 kg/ha. When insecticides were applied, yields of the ratoon crops (averaged over N levels) were 60 and 67% higher in 1977 and 1978, respectively, then when insecticides were not applied. Total grain yield from the planted plus ratoon crop grown with optimum N and insecticide treatments was<br />approximately 8,700 kg/ha in 1977 and 9,847 kg/ha in 1978.<br />This study indicates that N fertilization for ratoon sorghum is critical for economical yields. Also, supplemental N is important for hastening maturity, espe-<br />cially in years when the ratooning growing season is cooler than ""normal"" and maturation of grain is likely to be prevented by a killing frost. Finally, ratooning grain sorghum may be even more sensitive to the complex of sorghum insect pests than early-se&gt;sdinitiated grain sorghum; and low insect populations can prevent a positive ratoon grain yield response to applied N. This research demonstrates the feasibility<br />of ratooning grain sorghum production; however, until appropriate hybrids for ratooning systems are identified or developed, it will be difficult to develop im-<br />proved management practices.<br /><br /></p>","","","full text added; relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GARRITYel a].<br />INTRODUCTION<br />Small-scale farmers generally have diversified farm enterprises, with different resource requirements, that may involve various cropping patterns, animal production activities, and tree crops grown in the fence rows and homestead areas.<br />Strategies for increasing farm productivity that focus on introducing technical changes within a single-crop enterprise are often rejected by farmers because of unforseen negative effects on productivity or resource utilisation in other enterprises, or both. Cropping systems research approaches the problem of fitting relevant technology into the small farm operation by determining the effects of potential technical changes on the entire system. If the best cropping patterns for small-scale farmers in each major production environment are to be determined, the crop determinant variables, the present cropping systems and the productivity of alternatives must be defined.<br />A methodology for cropping systems research was proposed in 1975 by the Cropping Systems V¢orking Group (IRRI, 1975). The process consists of seven stages.<br />(1) Selection of target areas, (2) description of the target areas, (3) design of cropping patterns, (4) testing of cropping patterns, (5) applied research and preproduction testing, ~6) production programmes and (7) evaluation of change.<br />The last three stages must consider extension of the research results into a nation's programmes for agricultural production.<br />The proposed methodology involves the farmer as an active participant in the research team: the test patterns are grown on a portion of each cooperating farm under joint farmer researcher management. The farmer's participation in pattern testing facilitates early detection of some of the constraints to adoption at the farm level, which frequently go unnoticed (Zandstra, 1976). The IRRI Cropping Systems Program focuses on the rice-growing environments of South and South-East Asia : dryland, rainfed wetland and, to a lesser extent, irrigated wetland. The methodology was first applied to research for crop intensification on dryland rice-based systems. Experience with the use of the methodology in developing a dryland rice cropping systems test site in the Philippines is analysed here.<br />METHODOLOGY DEVELOPMENT<br />Dryland rice is rice grown on unbunded, well-drained fields without irrigation. It is grown on some 25 °o of the world's rice land (De Datta, 1972) and accounts for<br /><br />DETERMINING SUPERIOR CROPPING PATTERNS FOR SMALL FARMS<br /><br />271<br /><br />nearly 20 ~o of the total rice area of Asia (Barker, 1970). In the Philippines, dryland rice production is widely distributed but is concentrated in several zones (Fig. 1). Most farmers plant one dryland rice crop a year, without a preceding or following crop (Dozina &amp; Herdt, 1974). Some farmers grow two crops, with dryland rice followed by corn 80 ~o of the time that a second crop is grown.<br />Dryland rice environments are determined by three factors: the number of months of continuous adequate rainfall, the slope of the land, and the soil texture. The site selected for this study is in North-Eastern Batangas Province at a latitude of 14 °N and longitude ! 2 ! °E. It is about 100 m above sea level and has mean monthly temperatures between 26 and 34°C. It is representative of dryland rice-growing areas with 6 to 7 months of rainfall exceeding 100 mm/month, gentle slope ( &lt; 8 ~/o), and a medium soil texture. This environmental complex, a union of sites with the same values for the three environmental factors (Zandstra, 1976), is typical of the second largest dryland rice area in the country (Fig. 2) and was particularly suitable for intensive cropping systems.<br /><br />Site description The earliest work at the site was in 1973. It concentrated on understanding the<br />existing cropping systems and their relationships to the physical and economic conditions of the area (Frio &amp; Banta, 1974: Antonio &amp; Banta, 1974). The dominant characteristics of the site follow.<br />(1) In North-Eastern Batangas nearly all upland rice farmers grow a second crol&gt;-usually corn after rice. Rice and corn fit into the strongly unimodal rainy season, with the land fallowed for two months in the dry season (Fig. 3).<br />(2) The soils are fertile (Eutrandolls, pH6.0, loams), and nearly all tillage operations are by animal power.<br />(3) Roads, transport and markets are generally adequate. (4) Cash inputs to crop production are high for dryland farmers (about<br />$130/ha/crop). (5) Most farmers are share-tenants, and farms are generally less than 2.5 ha.<br /><br />Cropping pattern design As information on the farmers' resources and their current levels of crop<br />technology accumulated, three alternative cropping designs were identified:<br />(1) following rice with alternative field crops that may offer advantages over corn:<br />(2) Following rice with two crops, to extend cropping further into the dry season, and<br />(3) Following rice with intercrop patterns to replace monoculture corn.<br /><br />272 DENNIS P.

Philippine Weather Bureau, 1951-70.<br />These designs were to test possible alternatives to the local Tinumbaga corn variety that was commonly grown after rice. Three years of observation showed rice yields ranging from 2 to 2.2 t./ha.<br />The first year's cropping pattern trials were in the 1974-75 crop season. Alternative crops selected to follow rice were improved varieties of soybean, peanut, mung bean, and cowpea. The intercrops selected for the trials were sweet potato and glutinous corn. The three-crop-per-year patterns involved two crops following rice: sorghum followed by its ratoon, or glutinous corn followed by cowpea. Results of the trials were directly compared with the existing rice-corn pattern.<br />Cropping pattern testing Four villages within a 20 km radius were selected for the field trials, and 10 dryland<br />rice farmers from each village participated in the study. The dryland rice crop on the experimental parcel was managed entirely by the farmer with his usual variety and practices. After the rice harvest, the farmer prepared three 1000 m z plots. He planted two of the plots to test crops and one to his usual corn variety (Fig. 4). IRRI's support to the farmer covered the cost of fertiliser, seed, and pesticides (where used). The management practices were based on experience at IRR! and included fertiliser at rates of 30 kg N/ha on the legumes and 80 kg N/ha on all other crops, a single cultivation for weed control, and minimum insect and disease control. No P or K fertiliser was required.<br /><br />DETERMININGSUPERIORCROPPINGPATTERNSFOR SMALLFARMS 275<br /><br />60 m<br />Farmer's corn crop outside the experimental area<br /><br />Crop-cut samples<br />~farmer management<br /><br />Test crop: mung<br />!..i~.i.£.i<br />/ ~N2 zN 1 zN4:<br />~m3!<br /><br />Superimposed trials<br />~ N response: 4 levels x 2 replications<br />_ _ Handweeded: 3 replications<br />iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIiii!Carbofuran: :i:i:;:i:i::i; 2 replications<br /><br />-N4i<br />_N3 i zN2: I r///k<br /><br />Fig. 4. Sample layouts of three cropping patterns m a cooperating farmer's parcel and of the superimposed trials in a cropping pattern test field.<br />Several specific management components, weed control, insect control and nitrogen responses, were studied for several of the crops included in the alternative patterns to evaluate the validity of the management techniques that were used in the patterns. The layout for the component technology experiments, which were conducted within the 1000m 2 test plots, is shown in Fig. 4.<br />The possible residual effects of the test crops and their management practices on the yield of the following rice crop were also evaluated. Four 10 m 2 yield samples of the next rice crop (1975) after the pattern trials, were taken from the plots where the test crops had been planted, as well as from the adjacent plots previously planted to corn. Yields from the different crop treatments were compared in a splitplot statistical analysis.<br />The performance of the test patterns was evaluated through a two-step process.<br />(1) The agronomic suitability of each pattern to the test site was determined. The criteria for agronomic adaptation of a test crop were: good stand establishment under highly variable soil moisture conditions, good pest resistance, stable yields, and no adverse effect on the following rice crop.<br /><br />276 DENNIS P. GARRITY el al.<br />Patterns with obvious agronomic deficiencies were selected for further research on management technology or discarded as an error in design. (2) The test patterns were also subjected to economic analysis. The resource requirements of labour and cash for the patterns were evaluated. Each participating farmer kept a daily record, on specially prepared forms, of his operations on the experimental areas, and of labour and material inputs used.<br />It was hypothesised that the most important criteria a farmer considers in selecting a pattern are related to four economic considerations.<br />(1) Average returns to the farm enterprise--a measure of the net income the household derives from the crop. This measure was computed on a per hectare basis as the gross returns, less cash costs, less seed value of the pattern.<br />(2) Average returns to labour and m a n a g e m e n t ~ o m p u t e d per day of labour input as gross returns, less cash costs less seed value, less land rent.<br />(3) Average net returns to cash inputs--computed as gross returns, less cash costs, less seed value, less land rent, less value of all labour to cash costs.<br />(4) Probability of negative returns.<br />Technology changes that are likely to have the strongest potential for farmer adoption are those that substantially increase the average returns to each of the three resources--land, labour, and capital, yet do not significantly increase the probability of negative returns when compared with the existing technology.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Agronomic suitability The average corn yields across a sample of 50 farms in the area were obtained for<br />this crop season and the two previous years from another study (Garrity et al., 1975). The yields averaged 2.1 t./ha over the three-year period, with a range of 2.0 to 2.2 t./ha between years. Because of the similarity and relatively low variability in average yields over the period, the test season was considered to be a reasonably representative one.<br />A summary of the yields and the stability of the test crops is shown in Table 1. The yield potential for each crop during that season was approximated as the average yields of the two highest-yielding test farms.<br />The yield suitability of the test crops was estimated as the standard deviation and as the percentage to which average yields measured up to potential yields. Mung bean and cowpea yields were unacceptably variable because of severe insect and disease damage (Garrity, 1976). Soybean and peanut had stable yields, but from<br /><br />DETERMINING SUPERIOR CROPPING PATTERNS FOR SMALL FARMS<br /><br />277<br /><br />TABLE 1 YIELD PERFORMANCE AND YIELD STABILITY OF THE TEST CROPS PLANTED AFTER RICE, GROWN UNDER FARMERS'<br />MANAGEMENT, EASTERN BATANGAS, PHILIPPINES, LATE WET SEASON, 1974-75 a<br /><br />Crop<br /><br />Variety Farm YieM (t./ha)<br /><br />Measures of yield<br /><br />(no.) stability<br /><br />Av. for Potential<br /><br />all (av. of Av. as % Coefficient<br /><br />fields highest<br /><br />of<br /><br />of<br /><br />yieMing potential variation<br /><br />fields)<br /><br />Field corn<br />Sorghum Ist crop Sorghum ratoon Mung bean Cowpea Peanut Soybean Glutinous corn Sweet potato~zorn intercrop<br /><br />Orange flint UPCA variety Popcorn White flint Cosor 3 Cosor 3 CES 14 EG 2 C E S 101 TK 5 Synthetic 22 B N A S 51 Synthetic 22<br /><br />17 1.74 4 3-05 8 1.46 2 1.36 10 2.72 4 1-45 14 0.41 14 3.11 b 3 0-82c 3 0.92 5 26000 d 5 7.20 5 12740d<br /><br />2-42 3-52 2.15 1.36 3-55 1-88 0""98 5.92 b 0-88c 0-99 30580 a 9.18 15350 d<br /><br />72 87 68 -77 68 42 52 93 93 87 -81<br /><br />26 16 39<br />29 48 73 53 11 14 --35<br /><br />a Yield estimates are the average for three sample plots on each field. b Green pods. c Dry, unshelled. d Marketable ears/ha.<br /><br />fewer replications. The remaining crops showed stability comparable to that of the local corn varieties. Although stand establishment of soybean and sorghum during a high rainfall period was poor, stable yields were obtained by revising the furrowing operation for shallower planting.<br />No differences between rice yields following any of the test crops and those following corn were detected when the following season's rice crop was sampled (Table 2). The 2 3 month fallow period appeared to have dissipated potential allelopathic effects or residual effects. If the dry-season fallow period is eliminated by a three-crop sequence pattern, there is a potential for adversely affecting rice growth through nutrient depletion or biochemical products (Sikurajapathy, 1974). However, even these patterns showed no adverse effects on yields (Table 2).<br />The trials on component technology brought a number of cases where management practices designed for the patterns could be substantially improved. They confirmed the importance of conducting such trials in direct association with the pattern trials. There was strong evidence that levels of weed control higher than those practiced by the farmers would be uneconomical (Table 3), and that none of the legume crops responded sufficiently to nitrogen fertiliser application to justify the use of nitrogen for legumes (Fig. 5). Response to carbofuran insecticide sidedressed during early vegetative growth was significant for the cowpea and glutinous<br /><br />278 DENNIS P. GARRITY el al.

Total cash cost per hectare of test crop, Batangas, Philippines late wet season, 1974-75.<br /><br />The cost of labour and chemicals for crops ranged from US$35 to $105/ha (Fig. 7), with the legumes having the lowest requirements. Each farmer's resource limitations influences the crop alternatives from which he can select. A matrix of resource states was developed to illustrate which group of cropping patterns was likely to be adopted, given different levels of cash and harvest labour availability (Fig. 8). The amount of cash required for each crop alternative is varied along the vertical axis, and the labour requirement is varied along the horizontal axis.<br />Farmers presently grow corn after rice and utilise relatively high levels of cash inputs and a moderate level of harvest labour. Adopting legume crops would entail a downward shift to the right--lower cash inputs but higher harvest labour. Producing sorghum might entail moving upward to the right increasing both labour and cash needs. Thus, the available resources for each cropping pattern, in relation to their supply, may limit a farmer's adoption in spite of the potential to increase profits.<br />Returns to resources. The test crops used following rice were ranked according to their returns to resources and the chance of negative returns (Table 4). Two, sorghum and soybean, were consistently superior to orange flint corn and showed no negative return. Sorghum gave higher returns to the farm enterprise than corn, and its returns to labour and cash were about the same as those of corn.<br />Three other crop patterns (peanut, sweet potato-corn intercrop, and cowpea) showed attractive average returns per hectare, but their high labour requirements caused poor returns to labour and cash. The profitability of the last crops in the three-crop sequence was also promising (Table 4).<br /><br />DETERMINING SUPERIOR CROPPING PATTERNS FOR SMALL FARMS<br /><br />A~ O0<br />EE oo<br />oo<br />oo<br /><br />vv<br /><br />v<br /><br />C~09 A~<br />o~OO<br /><br />o~<br /><br />o ~ ~-~ o""<br /><br />Eo'~ o<br /><br />---<br /><br />-<br /><br />0o0~o0oo ~ O~~ooo~oo~~o :~o<br /><br />•o ._~ .E<br />n3<br />o~<br />. - 0 . p""<br /><br />28<br /><br />A fON v A<br />O<br />EE<br />OO OO<br /><br />AA<br /><br />&amp;A<br />~.<br />oE=<br /><br />I~,~ ~<br />~E~<br /><br />OOO<br /><br />OO<br /><br />A O<br />v~ O<br />EE ~<br />88~<br /><br />A O<br /><br />~0 ~ L~ o<br /><br />,~'~ ~<br /><br />o= ~<br />~ ""0 ~ 69<br />&lt; --<br /><br />~8<br />&gt;v<br /><br />~A mO<br />c~O<br /><br />~~?.~_~<br />AA<br />~O O<br />=E ""~.no<br />O O &amp;_~<br />~ d.E<br /><br />~A<br />o~<br />EE<br />oO OO<br />J ~O<br /><br />~:-=~ ~N<br />O ~- e-<br />.~<br /><br />282 DENNIS P.

This will tend to lower returns to cash inputs and discourage borrowing to invest in their use to some extent. There will be greater pressure towards the adoption of crop alternatives with lower cash requirements, thus, potentially favouring the legume crops which require little or no nitrogen.<br /><br />('ON('LUSI()NS<br />The initial cropping pattern trials showed that the adoption of an improved corn variety could increase productivity in the dryland rice-corn system studied. Soybean and sorghum appeared to be outstanding alternative crops. Because neither is presently grown in the area, however, their adoption would represent a more substantial change in the system. New infrastructural support, markets, and threshers would be required (Nicholas et al., 1976).<br />Corn is presently grown in monoculture. Intercropping it shows promise of substantially raising land productivity, but labour appears to be a potential constraint. More intercrop studies should be conducted, with special attention to labour requirements. Cropping patterns with 3 crops/year were shown to be feasible and profitable.

Tiller production of a ratoon sorghum crop was used as a measure of nonsenescence and this character was quantitatively inherited with additive genetic effects, with no indication of significant dominance genetic effects. The large estimates for additive genetic variation indicated that some progress could be made in selecting for tillers in a ratoon sorghum crop. However, heritability estimates were low (0.18–0.28) for number of tillers in ratooned sorghum.

Can. J. Plant Sci. 60:.473-478.<br />Six populations (P""""n, Pn"", F,, F2, Bcsen, BCn"") were used to estimate genetic variances for ratoon tiller regrowth in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). All data involving progeny of senescent and nonsenescent crosses were pooled for analysis using the joint scaling test. Parental lines differed significantly in tiller production. Tiller production of a ratoon sorghum crop was used as a measure of<br />nonsenescence and this character was quantitatively inherited with additive genetic<br />effects, with no indication of significant dominance generic effects. The large<br />estimates for additive genetic variation indicated that some progress could be made in selecting for tillers in a ratoon sorghum crop. However, heritability estimates were low (0.18-0.28) for number of tillers in ratooned sorghum. The selection program<br />would probably be most successful if it were based on tiller counts after 6 wk of regrowth. Estimates concerning the number of effective factors controlling tiller<br />number in a ratoon crop indicated that this characteristic is under the control of one major factor or chromosome segment.<br />Six populations (Pr""n, Pn"", Fr, Fz, BCr""n et BC'J ont servi )r estimer les variations . g6n6tiques intervenant dans la croissance des talles de repousse chez le sorgho<br />'(Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Only height and maturity<br />genes were involved in the conversion process (Johnson et al. l97l). Recently,<br />several converted lines from the sorghum<br />conversion program have been observed to<br />exhibit a perennialistic tendency or nonsenescing ability (Duncan 1977). A study was initiated in 1974 to compare senescent<br />and nonsenescent sorghum lines for various<br />agronomic characteristics. Senescent and<br />nonsenescent types were found to differ significantly in basal tiller production per<br />plant at grain harvest time (Duncan 1977).<br />Beil and Atkins (1965) obtained a significant positive phenotypic correlation between<br />number of tillers and grain yield (0.49)<br />which indicated that concurrent selection for profuse tillering and high yielding types should not be difficult. A high environmen-<br />tal correlation (0.56) for these characters indicated that conditions favoring the production of many tillers also favor high<br />grain yield. However, they speculated that<br />there is probably a threshold for tiller<br />numbers where further increases in number<br />may result in appreciably smaller heads and<br />lower total grain yield for the plant. For this<br />inheritance study, an assumption was made<br />that survival of tillers in a ratoon crop might<br />indicate a perennialistic or nonsenescing<br />capability.<br />The purpose of this study was to determine<br />the inheritance of tiller regrowth in a<br />ratooned sorghum crop. Beil and Atkins<br />(1965) and Chiang and Smith (1967) have reported that tiller number in sorghum is a quantitatively inherited character. Chiang<br />and Smith (1967) determined that the<br />expression of the character was caused<br />primarily by additive genetic effects. The<br />research by Beil and Atkins (1965) indicated<br />partial dominance of the genes for the tillering character in sorghum. Webster<br />(1965) reported that the tillering characteris-<br />tic in sorghum is controlled by a single pair<br />ofrecessive genes.<br /><br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Based on observations by Texas A&amp;M University plant breeders (Johnson et al. 1971) over time,<br />parental lines were classified on their ability to<br />remain green and vigorous at grain harvest. Two<br />categories were established: senescent lines vs. nonsenescent lines. Four senescent (RTx7000,<br />BTx378, RTx2536, SC02l4) and three nonsenescent (SC0056, SC0599, SCOI70) parental lines were used in this study. Crosses among hand-emasculated spikelets were made involving RTx7000 and SC0056 in all combinations with<br />other lines. The Ft plants were backcrossed to the<br />appropriate female parental lines.<br />The inheritance study was planted on 68-cm<br />wide row spacings during May 1976, at College Station, Texas. The Fr, Fr, and BCt populations were planted in single row plots and compared with their respective parental lines. The field<br />design was a randomized incomplete block<br />design with three replications. Plots were thinned<br />to 123 550 plants/ha. Number of tillers per plant (basal shoots emerging from the crown region near the soil surface) in the parental lines, Fr generation, and segregating progenies were<br />counted at three intervals: at senescent line<br />physiological maturity (135 days after planting)<br />before cutting back (0 wk), after 3 wk regrowth,<br />and after 6 wk regrowth. The plants were cut back<br />to a height of 5-6 cm with a machete.<br />A nested classification for the analysis of<br />variance was used to evaluate tiller counts of the parental lineS since different lines were being<br />compared between the two sorghum types<br />(senescent vs. nonsenescent). Frequency polygons were constructed from summarized data<br />involving senescent x nonsenescent and nonsenescent x senescent progenies. The data from<br />these two groups of progenies were pooled to provide the necessary data for both backcross populations. The joint scaling test of Mather and Jinks (1971) was conducted to determine if an additive-dominance model could adequately<br />evaluate the variation present. This test used the<br />means of six populations (Pn., Pr""., F1, F2, BCnr, BCr"",) to estimate the parameters m, (d), and (h).<br />The parameter m was the estimated midpoint<br />between the parental means, (d) was the fixable<br />or additive portion of the genetic variation, and<br />(h) reflected the dominance properties of the genes and represented the contribution of the<br />unfixable heritable variation. These estimates<br />were derived by a weighted least squares<br />procedure, using as weights the inverses of the<br /><br />DUNCAN ET AL. - TILLER REGROWTH<br /><br />variances of the population means. This scaling<br />test evaluated the goodness-of-fit of the threeparameter model [m, (d), (h)] to the observed<br />data by assuming that the sum of squared<br /><br />deviations [i.e. (observed values-expected values)21, weighted with the appropriate coeffi-<br /><br />cients, followed a chi-square distribution with 3<br />df. Lack of fit implied the existence of<br /><br />nonadditive gene effects (dominance) among<br /><br />loci.<br /><br />Dominance estimates were further determined<br />for tiller regrowth using the ""potence ratio""<br />method proposed by Griffing (1950). The<br /><br />potence ratio indicates dominance of individual<br /><br />genes preponderately in the same direction;<br /><br />however, zero potence does not necessarily 6 indicate complete absence of dominance. Herita- S<br /><br />bitity in the narrow sense (h2) was estimated<br />following the method of Warner (1952). A<br /><br />=F<br /><br />standard error for h2 was derived according to the<br /><br />method outlined by Ketata et al. (1976).<br /><br />An estimate of the minimum number of genetic<br />factors affecting tiller number per plant in ratooned sorghum was computed via two different formulas: (l) Castle-Wright formula<br /><br />according to Frey (1949), and (2) Sewall Wright formula accordins to Burton (1951).<br /><br />4',75<br />to<br />scoob6<br />\ sc0599<br />sc 0170 T'2 536<br />RT'7000 sc0214<br /><br />Can.

Average number of tillers per plant (A) and time x type interaction for number of basal tillers per plant (B) after 6 wk regrowth of<br />parental lines.<br /><br />number was essentially the same (time x<br />type interaction was not statistically differ-<br />ent) between the two types, but the nonsenescent lines were able to initially<br />produce and subsequently maintain more tillers per plant (Fig. 28).<br />Our research was not conducted beyond 6<br />wk regrowth because of frost damage, and<br />we were unable to determine if this trend was<br />maintained to grain harvest of the ratoon<br />crop. No additional fertilizer was applied to<br />the plots following cut-back, and this could<br />have had some bearing on the results. Moisture in the plots was not a limiting<br />factor. Nevertheless. our results indieated<br /><br />indirectly the capacity of the two types for<br />tiller maintenance and, in turn, senescent or<br />nonsenescent capability in ajuvenile ratoon<br />crop.<br />Frequency distributions ofthe parental F1, F2, and both backcross populations for tiller number per plant as a measure of nonsenes-<br />cence were typical of those expected of a quantitatively inherited character. Tillering per plant did not follow a normal distribution. but instead was skewed and variable.<br />Means of the Ft and F2 populations generally<br />were intermediate between the parental<br />means and the means of the backcross populations were similar to those of the<br />recurrent parent (Table 2).<br />The chi-square values from the joint scaling test showed similar results for all sampling dates. Tiller number of the ratoon crop adequately fits an additive-dominance<br />model and the estimates for m, (d), and (h)<br />were not biased to any significant extent by<br />the effects not attributable either to the additive or dominance action of the genes<br />(Table 2). Nonallelic interaction or epistasis<br />did not significantly bias the results.<br />All estimates of (d) were positive and significantly different from zero. All estimates of (h) were negative and not<br />s i gnificantl y different from zero. Therefore,<br />we concluded that dominance genetic effects<br />were not a major factor in the inheritance of<br />tiller regrowth and that the expression of the character was caused primarily by additive genetic effects. Further verification that<br />dominance genetic effects were not a major inheritance factor is given in Table 3. The<br />potence ratio at 3 and 6 wk regrowth was 0,<br />indicating no dominance. At 0 wk regrowth, the potence ratio of 0.059 indicated partial<br />dominance of the genes for the tillering<br />characteristic, which parallels the results of<br />Beil and Atkins (1965). Narrow sense heritability estimates were<br />low (Table 3), but coupled with the large<br />additive genetic variation estimates, it seems<br />that some progress could be made in<br />selecting for tiller counts of ratoon growth.

The production potential of various rainfed (non-irrigated) crops was established for each agro-ecological zone and new cropping systems were<br /><br />104<br />devised to help farmers make better use of soil and climatic resources. Descriptions of cropping seasons, crop types and production methods for the various regions of India (Anonymous, 1970) were further refined by using the preliminary results of the project.<br />In this paper, examples of dryland cropping systems and their components will be given to illustrate the potential for rainfed agriculture in various regions of India. Some constraints which limit increased crop production will be discussed.<br />PHYSICALRESOURCESAND METHODOLOGY<br />Research stations<br />The 23 dryland agricultural research units which participate in the Coordinated Dryland Research Project are part of existing research centers, usually at universities or at government research stations (Fig.l). The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) finances most of the work. The stations represent eight agro-climatic zones (Table I) (Krishnamoorthy, 1972). The results presented in this paper were obtained by scientists at these research stations and were submitted to the Dryland Project through reports prepared at their respective institutions. In the original reports all the crop yields given were parts of experimental trials complete with statistical analyses and experimental errors. Experiments which failed due to drought, floods, insects or disease, were mentioned, but only meaningful results were tabulated. Hence, the yields used in this paper represent values taken from statistically sound experiments. Probabilities or risks of crop failure using the improved methods for dryland farming cannot be calculated since the testing program has been carried out only for 4 or 5 years.<br />Climate<br />The climate of the 23 stations is presented graphically (Fig.2) to show the general differences between stations (they range from arid to sub-humid) and the diverse types of season that have been experienced in testing crop management within the Dryland Project. The use of climatic analysis to help explain cropping patterns in India was demonstrated by Singh et al. (1974).<br />At the Dryland Research Project Coordinating Cell in Hyderabad, the water balance charts for each station were calculated using the methods of Thornthwaite and Mather (1955). Mean monthly potential evaporation (PE) and precipitation (P) at each station (most stations have 30 years of meteorological records) and an average value for field capacity (FC) or water holding capacity of the profile (usually 1 m) were used. This can over-estimate available water if surface desiccation becomes a problem. The average periods of the year are shown when the soil can be expected to have insufficient water for plant growth (D), when the soils are being recharged with moisture,<br /><br />105<br /><br />, oSAMBA<br /><br />INDIA DRYLAND RESEARCH CENTRES<br /><br />LUDHIANA ""X o DEHR~ DI<br />oDELHI<br /><br />oAGRA °JODHPUR<br /><br />oUDAIPUR<br /><br />°JHANSI oVARANASI<br />o<br />REWA<br /><br />AoNAND olNDORE<br /><br />oRANCHI<br /><br />oA KO LA<br /><br />BHUBANESWARo<br /><br />SHOLAPUR<br />IJAPU~ @HYDE<br />\ BELLARY<br />ANAt~TAPUR( ~NGALOR~/~<br /><br />@COORDINATING CELL OF DRYLAND RESEARCH CENTRES<br />o DRYLAND RESEARCH CENTRES<br /><br />KOVI LPATTI<br />Fig. 1.

This general climatic analysis was used within the Dryland Project to identify general cropping pattern areas: e.g., where rice could be grown (surplus water needed); where Woo sequential crops could be grown with ease or with difficulty, depending on the length of growing season; where only one crop could be grown safely; and where extreme drought hazards could occur.<br /><br />TABLE I<br /><br />The agro-climatic zones and research centers of the Dryland Project with the main crops, their area of crops, the cropping seasons and some representative yields<br /><br />Agro-climatic zone<br /><br />Research centre<br /><br />Representative crops<br /><br />Area<br />(%)<br /><br />Crop season<br /><br />Research~ Farmers2 achievement average yield (q/ha) yield (q/ha)<br /><br />Other crops grown in region<br /><br />(1) Sub-<br /><br />a Ludhiana<br /><br />Maize<br /><br />80 June--Sept. 35<br /><br />20<br /><br />Moth beans, rice, sorghum<br /><br />montane;<br /><br />Wheat<br /><br />70 Nov.--Feb.<br /><br />45<br /><br />10<br /><br />fodder, lentil, sugarcane,<br /><br />Colluvial<br /><br />Chickpea<br /><br />15<br /><br />Oct.--Feb.<br /><br />15<br /><br />8 pearl millet, pigeon pea,<br /><br />soil<br /><br />Rape/mustard 5<br /><br />Oct.--Feb.<br /><br />20<br /><br />5 groundnut, blackgram,<br /><br />b.

Crops can fail during any season due to combinations of adverse climate and unfortunate crop management, e.g., date of sowing. Calculating the probabilities of failure due to periodic flooding and/or drought is difficult. However, daffy climatic data are currently being analyzed in detail within the Dryland Project and at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad (S.M. Virmani, personal communication, 1976), to permit the calculation of probabilities for various durations and frequencies of drought and high rainfall intensity periods during the rainfall season. In addition, the predictability of the arrival times of the monsoon season for the various stations and the probabilities of extended seasons are being studied.<br />Soi/s<br />Using broad definitions, there are eight major soil types in India: (1) coastal alluvial soils and alluvial soils of the major river plains and valleys (the Gangetic Plain being the largest area); (2) shallow, medium and deep black cotton soils, developed from basaltic rock; (3) red soils developed from granitic rock; (4) areas of mixed black and red soils; (5) laterite soils; (6) desert soils; (7) mountain meadow soils and sub-mountain podzolic soils; and (8) brown and gray brown hill soils usually developed on sandstone and shales (Raychaudhuri and Rajan, 1971).<br />Major irrigation projects have been developed for most of the alluvial soil areas; hence the black and red soils of the Deccan Plateau are the dominant soil types that support rainfed agriculture in India. The soil types associated with the 23 dryland research stations are given in Table I.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Dryland crops and cropping systems<br />Crops and yields. More than 50 crops were tested within the Dryland Project (Appendix). The types of crops, their relative importance, the cropping seasons and the yield of crops vary from region to region (Table I); optimal research yields and farmers' yields are also given. To estimate the actual production potential of various regions, the probabilities of crop failure or near-failure would need to be considered. This will be done when sufficient long term data accrue within the Dryland Project.<br />Trials that compared new technology with traditional practices (Fig.3) illustrate that improved varieties, early sowing, good sowing methods, good weed control and fertilizer use can readily increase yields by 100% or more. The operational difficulties inherent in the introduction of the improved technology were tested since the plots were approximately 0.5 ha and the<br /><br />113<br /><br />38<br />34 3O<br />J 26<br /><br />t IMPROVED I-.D----TRADITIONAL<br /><br />i 22 18<br />I,U<br />i ell!6<br />2<br /><br />Fig.3.

Although not proven, good management seemed to reduce the effects of drought. Similar results were reported by Chowdhury (1975) in his review of current Indian dryland cropping systems.<br /><br />Crop substitution. Many of the minor traditional crops grown are not the<br />most productive for the region. Crop substitution can often be demonstrated as advantageous (Table II). This becomes most obvious when a temperate crop like wheat is grown in southern India or when a frost sensitive crop like safflower is grown in the north. Often the farmers have their own economic or social reasons for growing a crop which does not give a good yield in their region. Certain sociological needs may have to be respected, but changes in some of the food habits should be encouraged and markets developed. Sorghum and maize have demonstrated potential in large tracts where traditionally other foods are used. The introduction of long stapled varieties of<br />cotton (Gossypium barbadense)to irrigated areas has reduced the demand for dryland cotton (Gossypium arboreum/herbaceum)and, thus, dryland<br />cotton areas are available for a substitute crop, namely sorghum (see Bellary, 1973, in Table II).<br />Inter-cropping. Two crops grown simultaneously in a field in various row<br />arrangements can often produce more than either grown separately.

Traditionally farmers have discovered the compatibility of certain crops and have minimized the risks in production, e.g., Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea) and sorghum. If one crop should fail due to drought, insect damage or disease, then the other takes up the extra resources and yields proportionally more. Inter-cropping is suited to areas with a growing season too long to be effectively utilized by a single crop but too short for successful sequence cropping. In the case of sorghum and pigeon pea, the crops can be sown at the same time (in different rows). The pigeon pea grows slowly and is not severely affected by shading from the fast-growing sorghum. The sorghum is harvested just as pigeon pea begins to branch and flower. In addition to making better use of resources and reducing risk, inter-cropping, especially with cereal--legume combinations, can increase the dietary value of the total harvested crop (Andrews and Kassam, 1976; Freyman and Venkateswarlu, 1977). Many crop combinations were tried at various stations; some results are shown in Table III. Optimum populations of both component crops make the system more productive and less risky. Pigeon pea--sorghum is o f t e n grown 1 row : 4 rows when the best yields (Hyderabad) could be attained with a ratio of 1 : 2 (Freyman and Venkateswarlu, 1977). Continued research work on inter-cropping is needed (Sanchez, 1976).<br /><br />Sequence cropping. Some regions have monsoon rainfall followed by some winter rain, and in areas with about 1000 mm or more this has allowed traditional farming systems to be developed on the basis of two crops a year. Both kharif 1 and rabi ~ crops are grown at Samba, Ludhiana, Dehra Dun,<br />lHindi words: kharif is used to refer to the s.w. monsoon season, usually occurring from June to October, and rabi is used for the dry post-monsoon season usually from October to February.

Single cropping may be inevitable in some regions like BeUary and Bijapur owing to lack of adequate rains in June, July and August, but some traditional fallowing during the monsoon is also practised in areas like Indo~e where two crops could readily be grown if the kharif crop were sown early (Table IV). Long duration kharif crops, particularly upland rice at Varanasi and Ranchi, and traditional sorghum varieties at Indore prevent many farmers from taking a rabi crop, since after the monsoon the upper soil layers can become too dry. Newly-demonstrated cropping systems using short duration kharif crops and better sowing methods for the second crop (Indore and Varanasi) could make double cropping easier for the farmers. The methods are applicable to large tracts of land.<br />The two-crop systems at Hyderabad in 1973 (Table IV) were possible because of an extended monsoon season. Similarly, in the Akola region advantage can be taken of late September rains. Safflower planted in a standing crop of sorghum 7 days before harvest yielded 14 q/ha in 1973. In the Bangalore region the early May rains (around 10--15 cm) can be used for more than a preparation period for the traditional main crop of finger millet. Cowpeas followed by transplanted finger millet is being recommended (Table IV). Examples of the potential and problems of sequential cropping in the Dehra Dun region are given by Singh et al. (1976).<br />Agronomic practices<br />Methods of sowing. The traditional method of sowing is to open a furrow either with a slightly modified wooden plough or a wooden hoe-drill and to distribute the seed by hand either through an attached tube or directly into the furrow. This method gives good results when the seedbed is not weedy or loose from recent ploughing. Hand distribution of seed at a given rate is accurate for a short period of time, but it is difficult for an individual to maintain accuracy for long periods. In 1973, in one set of tests with pearl millet, mechanized seeding gave better yields, primarily because of uniform sowing at a uniform depth into firm, moist soft. Mechanization can make operations more timely, e.g., sowing at the optimum time after a rain. However, with care, improved non-mechanized sowing can give yields as good or better than those from mechanized seeders (Table V).<br />Dates of sowing. Weed-free land is needed for the preparation of a good seedbed and, for this, post~harvest (post~monsoon) tillage is desirable. This permits early sowing of kharif crops at the beginning of the monsoon season. Soil moisture is not lost through preseeding tillage for weed control and the early crops escape major insect and disease damage. (Examples include shoot-fly in sorghum and downy-mildew and ergot in pearl millet.) With early-sown crops, the effects of mid-season drought or an early end to the monsoon axe mitigated. Early sowing in two-crop areas allows the first crop to be harvested<br /><br />118<br /><br />TABLE V<br /><br />Methods of sowing pearl millet compared at Hyderabad, Hissar and Anatapur in 1973 (yield in q/ha)<br /><br />Local method, bullock plough, hand sowing, planking<br /><br />Indian bullock drawn hoe-drill<br /><br />Canadian tractor drawn disk-press drill<br /><br />Hyderabad Hissar Anatapur<br /><br />7.1 3.8 7.8<br /><br />16.9 16.3 7.8 7.5<br />12.3 --<br /><br />1 q = 100 kg.<br /><br />at the optimum time for planting the second crop. Early planting of short duration upland rice at Varanasi and Ranchi facilitates second cropping; similarly, sorghum--safflower is a good combination at Indore provided sorghum can be harvested early.<br />Early sowing of rabi crops while the monsoon is still active allows the crop additional moisture before the dry season begins. This, in turn, allows the moisture stored in the soil profile to be used effectively during later stages of growth. One reason for resisting a change in the traditional dates of sowing or changing to varieties with a shorter growing season may be the risk of having grain maturity (harvest) occur during a rainy part of the season. However, this is always a risk with kharif cropping.<br />Dates of sowing experiments for many crops have been conducted at most research stations. In many cases the traditional sowing times (often based on the lunar calendar) are not the best, especially for improved varieties (Table V:<br /><br />Weed control. Nearly all stations have conducted weed management experiments and have clearly demonstrated that weed control has a major impact on crop yields. For example: upland rice at Varanasi yielded 44.2 q/ha when weed-free and 15.5 q/ha when unweeded; maize at Dehra Dun when weed-free and unweeded yielded 46.6 and 17.6 q/ha, respectively. At Sholapur, pearl millet and sorghum yields were decreased by not weeding from 17.8 and 14.6 q/ha to 9.3 and 9.2 q/ha, respectively. In addition, the beneficial effect of early weeding has been shown; at Sholapur pearl millet yield was decreased from 14 to 5 q/ha when left unweeded for 20 d after sowing.<br />Chemical weed control research has led to some recommendations based on herbicides available in India. Alachlor (Lasso) can be used to control weeds in groundnut and cotton (using about 3 kg/ha of active ingredient). For weed control in maize, atrazine (about 2 kg/ha active ingredient) sprayed either as pre-plant or pre-emergence has given excellent results. High labor costs and the difficulties of hand weeding during the monsoon has made pre-plant atrazine for maize a very acceptable practice for farmers in the Punjab and Northern Uttar Pradesh. Both the Dehra Dun and Ludhiana stations have successfully promoted chemical weed control for maize (Singh et al., 1976).<br /><br />TABLE VI<br /><br />Examples of the effect of sowing dates on various crops at several stations<br /><br />Center<br /><br />Year<br /><br />Crop<br /><br />Time of planting<br /><br />Yield (q/ha)<br /><br />Hyderabad 1973<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />June 8 June 22 July 7* July 20<br /><br />54.1 46.1 17.2<br />0.9<br /><br />Pearl millet<br /><br />June 22 July 7* Aug. 3<br /><br />41.9 34.1 17.4<br /><br />Finger millet<br /><br />June 22 July 7 Aug. 3*<br /><br />19.8 29.5 37.3<br /><br />Sholapur<br /><br />1971<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />Sept. 8 Oct. 7*<br /><br />8.8 4.2<br /><br />Safflower<br /><br />Sept. 8 Oct. 7*<br /><br />12.4 7.2<br /><br />Chickpea<br /><br />Sept. 8 Oct. 7*<br /><br />8.4 4.4<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />Aug. 25 Oct. 22*<br /><br />18.7 7.7<br /><br />Ranchi<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Wheat<br /><br />Nov. 16 Nov. 30*<br /><br />11.2 8.2<br /><br />Indore<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Sunflower<br /><br />Aug. 22<br /><br />18.9<br /><br />Kovilpatti 1973<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />Oct. 15 Oct. 30*<br /><br />25.1 4.2<br /><br />Bellary<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />Sept. 19 Oct. 12""<br /><br />49.5 20.0<br /><br />Bijapur<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />Aug. 24 Sept. 24*<br /><br />22.7 17.1<br /><br />Safflower<br /><br />Sept. 1 Sept. 24*<br /><br />20.8 7.5<br /><br />*Close to traditional data of sowing. l q ffi 100 kg.<br /><br />119<br /><br />120<br /><br />Fertilizer use. Fertilizers are costly in India and the farmer wants a good reliable return for money invested. For this reason farmers traditionally use fertilizers only on irrigated crops. The Dryland Project has demonstrated returns from fertilized dryland crops which are comparable to those from irrigated crops, especially at moderate rates (Fig.4). With 40 kg N/ha, many crops responded to fertilizer by giving over 20 kg of extra grain for every kg of N applied; the magnitude of response decreases with the higher rates, except for maize. Crop responses to phosphate fertilizers have not been as dramatic as for nitrogen.<br />The 30 examples selected represent a cross section of the hundreds of fertilizer response trials conducted by the Dryland Project (4--5 crops × 23 stations × 4--5 years). Variations in the magnitude of response generally reflect the effects of the weather since soil tests usually indicated a need for supplementary nutrients.<br /><br />NITROGEN<br /><br />PHOSPHATE<br /><br />40<br /><br />30 ~ ' ~ ~ J f ~ ~ ' ~<br /><br />-- 20<br /><br />•<br /><br />J<br /><br />~g n<br /><br />f-<br /><br />b c<br />d<br />f<br /><br />r-<br /><br />ii<br /><br />iii<br /><br />20 40 60 80 100<br /><br />ij<br /><br />i<br /><br />20 40<br /><br />60<br /><br />i<br />80<br /><br />FERTILIZER-N kg/ha(adequateP205applied)<br /><br />P205 APPLIED kg/ha(withadequateN)<br /><br />Fig.4.

Some responses to K have been found on sandy alluvial soils, e.g., Varanasi, but most Indian dryland softs have enough kaolinitic (ftlitic) clay to allow a rapid exchange of K into an available form (Mukherjee et al., 1971).<br />One management technique recommended for dryland agriculture is the splitting of nitrogen dressings. With this practice the yields are as good or better than with one larger application (Table VII), the advantage being that if the crop stand is unsatisfactory, or if a moisture stress occurs after sowing, the subsequent dressings can be decreased or eliminated. The work of Singh et al. (1975) at the Ludhiana research station gives guidance on the use of nitrogen fertilizer for wheat based on stored water and rainfall.<br />Another method of increasing fertilizer efficiency simulates an old method used in Gujarat and Rajasthan, where organic manures are applied in fixed plant rows, which are maintained for years. This method is currently used in Saurashtra for the production of groundnut, pearl millet and cotton. Chemical fertilizers are added in the same manner as organic manures. The rows become fertile and the soil structure improves to allow easy tillage, good groundnut<br /><br />TABLE VII<br /><br />Some results from split application of fertilizer nitrogen<br /><br />Center<br /><br />Crop<br /><br />Method of application<br /><br />Yield (q/ha)<br /><br />Bangalore<br /><br />Finger millet<br /><br />All at planting I Three splits2<br /><br />25.1 27.8<br /><br />Dehra Dun<br /><br />Maize<br /><br />All at planting Three splits<br /><br />34.7 38.1<br /><br />Ranchi<br /><br />Upland rice<br /><br />All at planting T w o splits2<br /><br />24.8 33.9<br /><br />Rewa<br /><br />Upland rice<br /><br />All at planting Three splits<br /><br />27.0 41.0<br /><br />Udalpur<br /><br />Sorghum<br /><br />All at planting Two splits<br /><br />9.3 13.0<br /><br />Agra<br /><br />Pearl millet<br /><br />All at planting Three splits<br /><br />8.5 13.8<br /><br />1The recommended rate (usually 40 kg N/ha). 2Three splits usually means V, of the recommended rate at sowing, ½ around tillering<br />and the remaining ~Aat the 'boot' stage or just before flowering.

The fixed rows are tilled (one plough furrow) after harvest and the fertilizers are applied in that furrow prior to sowing. Inter-row areas are harrowed for weed control and shaped for inter-row water harvesting. The rows in Saurashtra are traditionally 90 cm apart but practice is slowly tending towards 45-cm rows.<br />Future needs<br />Water harvesting for supplemental irrigation. Monsoon rains often come with an intensity far exceeding the infiltration rate of the soil. Kampen (1974) gave examples of rainfall intensities up to 50 mm per half hour at Hyderabad, India, where the soil infiltration rates were less than 10 mm/h. Run-off is inevitable. The amount of run-off is related to the number of intense storms, antecedent rainfall, soil type, crop cover and topography.<br />When run-off water is collected it can be used to extend the growing season or to irrigate crops. Tank paddy systems are traditional and common throughout the dryland areas of Indi~- If small tanks could be used to collect water in the upper reaches of the catchments then the water could be used for minimal irrigation to save crops from moisture stress. Research at Hyderabad on linings for seepage control has shown that asphalt and cow-dung plaster have promise for farm use. Complete operational water harvesting systems need to be developed for the various regions (an example is given in Fig.5). The International Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, is engaged in research in this field (Kampen, 1974; Anonymous, 1974).<br />BUND<br /><br />The rewo system:<br /><br />I PEC,AL f ~ E P _~<br /><br />=""<br /><br />1.

Rainfed crop yields fluctuate widely from year to year owing to vagaries of the weather. Weather abnormalities that can cause severe difficulty include: (1) delayed onset of the monsoon; (2) long drought spells during the monsoon season; and (3) early end of the monsoon.<br />Most stations have identified crops suitable for early or late plantings. For example, in the Deccan region, failures of early sown sorghum, pigeon pea or castor can be replaced by mid-July to mid-August sowings of pearl millet, setaria, cowpea and sunflower.<br />If the drought affects growth before the initiation of inflorescence then kharif sorghum crops can be ratooned for forage and regrown for grain with subsequent rains. If October rains are subnormal, Deccan rabi crops may be saved by thinning. Strategies for crop production under drought conditions have been published by the Dryland Project (Nair, 1974).<br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Research has shown that the extensive methods now used by many Indian farmers in the dryland regions of India can be improved. Yields could be raised, cropping could be intensified through the application of relatively simple improved practices. Cropping recommendations for various regions have been made (Nair, 1974) but continual research, testing, evaluation and development will improve them. The introduction of new technology to farmers often creates operational difficulties, and hence operational research on farmers' fields has become important within the ICAR Dryland Project.<br />ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br />The authors thank Dr M.S.

Under this system there is minimal land preparation, and planting is dispensed with because several harvests could be attained from a single planting. In grain and forage sorghums, higher<br />yields per hectare per year are also obtained. Ratooning of forage sorghum has been found successful in India, Hawaii, and Australia and of grain sorghum in<br />India, Hawaii, Australia, Arizona, California, and the Philippines (4). Problems that are usually encountered during the seedling stage are minimized or elimi-<br />nated since plant establishment is rapid. There is also less exposure to either drought or continuous rainfall because ratoon crops are generally early maturing and therefore, do not stay in the field long.<br />Time and location of tiller appearance are important factors in determining the number and vigor of<br />productive tillers which, in turn, govern the yields and/or life duration of a ratoon crop (4). An individ-<br />ual tiller, known as a phytomer, is considered to be the unit of growth of grasses, hence it becotr~es an important factor in crops that are harvested several times from a single sowing (ratooning). Too early development could result in nonsurvival of tillers, while late<br />development could result in the production of immature tillers at harvest which would not contribute to<br />the grain yield. Some late tillers also die. For perennial grasses which do not produce rhizomes or stolons, the tiller is the organ responsible for the perenniality of the crop.<br />In grass species perenniality is affected by successive tiller production throughout the year, accompanied<br />by death of tillers. Both the production and death of tillers show an annual rhythmic pattern and give rise to the annual pattern in tiller production per unit area. The expected life duration of an individual till-<br />ers depends on the time of the year when the axillary bud develops into an active tiller. Initiation of roots<br />of grasses from tiller bases and their subsequent growth are influenced by the physical environment of the plant (5). Depressed tillering and tiller mortality hardinggrass (Phalaris tuberosa var. stenoptera (Hack.) Hitchc.) were associated with the developmental stage<br />of the plant and were aggravated by moisture deficiency due to increasing dryness and temperature (2).<br />Intense competition at the early stage of plant growth and development hinders the capacity of the plant to produce tillers. As the number of plants per<br />unit area increases, competition stress becomes greater. Competition affects maturity and yields in later stages of plant development.<br />Grimes and Musick (1) found that grain sorghum had wide tolerance to varying plant populations, and<br />that such tolerance was brought about by ability of sorghum to tiller and to produce larger heads at low<br /><br />473<br /><br />474 AGRONOMY JOURNAL, VOL. 67, JULY-AUGUST 1975<br /><br />Fig. 1. Longitudinal section of a sorghum stem showing the basal nodes.<br /><br />plant populations, or to produce smaller or no heads at higher populations.<br />There have been no detailed reports of tillering behavior in ratooned sorghum, hence the objective of this experiment was to study closely the tillering behavior of sorghum and its potential effects on ratoon crops. Factors studied were: time and position of tiller initiation, when and what tillers die before reaching maturity, productive tillers per unit area, and grain and stover yields.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />Three sorghum hybrids, 'Mini-milo Br 54,' NK 222A, and NK 300, were planted under three plant populations [Pj —5, P2 =10, and P3 =20 plants per 3.7 liter (5-gal.) pot with a diam. of 28.5 cm]. The plant populations, on a per hectare basis were 7 x 105 for Plf 7 X JO"" for PS. and 14 x 10"" for PaThe experimental design was a randomized, complete block with three replications.<br />Twenty-seven 3.7 liter cans were filled with fumigated soil. The seeds were sown on Feb. 12, 1971. The hybrid and popu-<br /><br />lation treatments were randomly arranged. The plants were grown outside in a nursery area. Application o£ fertilizers on a per hectare basis was 150 kg N (in split-application), £00 kg P, and 150 kg K. Watering was done daily. The area was covered with a plastic net to protect the panicles from birds.<br />The tillering potential of the central plants was observed closely by counting the number of tillers produced each week. Each tiller was identified by a tag with the date of appearance and the tiller number or sequence as it sprouted from the cut stubble. The height of cutting was 8 cm. Plant height, days to 50% heading, head size, grain and stover yields, and maturity were recorded.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Place of Origin of Early Tillers. In the plant crop, early tillers originated from the basal nodes of the plant. As the plant grew and epigeal nodes were produced, tillers arose from either basal or epigeal nodes (Fig. 1 to 4).<br />In the first and second ratoons, the first two or three tillers developed from the basa portion of the plant,<br /><br />476 AGRONOMJOYURNALV, OL. 67, JULY-AUGUS1T975<br /><br />Table1.

It took a little more than a month for plants in populations 1 and 2 in the plant crop to produce the first tillers; for population 3, almost 2 months (Table 1). Within hybrids,<br />the time difference in the production of the first few tillers was not so great, but as tillering continued the time gap became wider.<br />In the first and second ratoons, production of tillers amonghybrids at different plant populations was rapid. Six to 9 days after harvest, tillers appeared mainly from the basal portions of the stubble. The<br />time interval between tiller appearance in populations 1 and 2 was not so great as in population 3. Tillers that developed later usually originated from the epigeal nodes. All tillers appeared before heading. As in the<br />plant crop, tillers that developedearly did not survive.<br />Time of appearance of tillers in the second ratoon was about the same as in the first ratoon. Tillers were<br />produced by pIants in rapid sequence.<br />Tillers developed more slowly in higher planting densities due to competition. It is possible that nutrients which could be utilized for tiller production<br />are translocated to other parts of the plant for growth. Coxnpetition for light also retarded tiller production.<br />Time of Death of Early Tillers. Not all tillers that developed in the plant crop and ratoon crops reached maturity. In most cases the first two tillers died (Ta-<br />ble I). Death of early tillers was attributed to the fact that while the parent shoot is growing and becoming established, it cannot fully support the tillers without injuring itself. Milthorpe and Davidson (3) assumed<br />that part of the dry matter accumulating in the tiller is derived from the parent shoot and is not the product<br /><br />of photosynthesis of its ownleaves. Williams (5) found that young, fully expanded leaves translocate assimilates to youngtillers in the axils of older leaves. This<br />indicates that tillers that appear before the parent shoot becomes well established will either die or be<br />retarded in growth. Tillers that develop when the parent shoot can support them reach maturity and produce heads. Food manufactured during the repro-<br />ductive stage is utilized predominantlyin grain-fillJlng; hence available nutrients are inadequate to support normal growth and development of late tillers.<br />Tiller Production of the Three Hybrids. In the<br />plant crop, NK222A produced two tillers per plant in each population; the first tiller originated from the base and the second tiller from the first node. It took 21 to 65 days after emergencefor the two early tillers to die in the plant crop while in the ratoon crops, it<br />took 7 to 22 days after development of tiller buds for<br />the early tillers to die. Tillers that were produced, on the upper parts of the stubble usually were not productive because they were more susceptible to break-<br />age. These high tillers also had weak root systems which were made up of adventitious or aerial roots. Both tillers died after 2 months. With NK300 more tillers were produced per plant in population one<br />than in the two higher populations. Tillers appeared from the first node. In population 3, tillers of Minimilo and NK300 appeared late. It was almost heading<br />time whenthese hybrids produced tillers; the rest of the tillers appeared after heading. Tillers of NK300 died rapidly.<br />The number of plants per pot did not remain the same because some plants died after each harvest. However, the ratoon plants produced several tillers per plant.<br /><br />ESCALADA &amp; PLUCKNETT: RATOON CROPPING. I.<br /><br />477<br /><br />Fig. 4. Tillers arising from both the basal and epigeal nodes of a ratooned sorghum plant.<br /><br />Reproductive Tillers at Three Plant Populations. Significant differences among populations and among hybrids were found in the number of reproductive tillers. More tillers that headed were developed during the plant crop (PC), and the number declined in each succeeding ratoon crop. In population 1, reproductive tillers of both NK 222A and NK 300 increased frim the first (1R) to the second ratoon (2R) (Fig. 5). At this low plant population, interplant competition occurred at panicle initiation. In higher plant populations competition set in earlier, hence plants suffered both interplant and intraplant competition, resulting in loss of panicle-bearing tillers and in less uniform plant height. As the number of plants per unit area increased, development of tillers was delayed.<br />Grain and Stover Yields. Significant differences in grain yields and stover yields were observed (Fig. 5). No significant differences were observed in the date of maturity of the three hybrids.<br />Increased plant population resulted in increased yield. This was true in populations 2 and 3 despite<br /><br />short heads and fewer reproductive tillers, because the large number of plant per unit area compensated for these low yield factors. In population 1, tillers produced larger heads but lower grain yield than in populations 2 and 3. This result was later confirmed in a field experiment.<br />In the plant crop, NK 300 produced more grain yield in population one than in the other two populations. This happened because of mutual shading and intense competition in populations 2 and 3. Daylength might have helped induce this effect too. Since NK 300 is somewhat responsive to photoperiod, floral initiation occurred early under short days, thus producing short, grain type plants with lower stover yields. Under longer days, floral initiation was delayed, resulting in the development of tall, forage-type plants, hence higher stover yields. These effects took place during the plant crop and the first ratoon (Fig. 5). In the second ratoon, low temperatures might have delayed flowering and therefore influenced lower<br /><br />478 AGRONOMY JOURNAL, VOL. 67, JULY-AUGUST 1975<br /><br />_. 7<br /><br />NK 222A<br /><br />NK 300<br /><br />2R<br />Fig. 5.

Stover yields were highest in population 3 because of dense stands.<br />In the first ratoon the three hybrids in high plant populations produced high stover yields; however, in the second ratoon all hybrids produced low stover yields (Fig. 5). The growth period of the second ratoon was in winter where plants were subjected to low temperature, low light intensity, short daylength, and high rainfall.<br />Generally, the number of reproductive tillers per hectare in all hybrids decreased from the first to the second ratoons in all plant populations. Head size was greater in low plant population than in high plant populations. Under dense stands, fewer grains per head and low individual grain weights were noted.<br /><br />and NK 300) were studied under three plant populations (Pi, P2, and P3).<br />Early tillers of the three hybrids originated either from basal nodes or from the epigeal nodes adjacent to elongated internodes; later tillers usually originated from nodes adjacent to elongated internodes. In the plant crop the first tillers arose at least 1 month after seed germination. The time interval of tiller appearance became wider among late tillers. In ratoon crops the tillers appeared 1 week after harvest of the previous crop. The time gap between tiller appearance became greater also as late tillers were produced.<br />Not all tillers reached maturity. Generally the first and second tillers that arose either from basaj nodes or from epigeal nodes of the plants died. The succeeding tillers were productive, i.e., produced panicles. However, very late tillers did not contribute to grain yield.<br />Mini-milo produced the highest number of tillers per plant, followed by NK 222A, and then NK 300 in population 1. Tiller number declined from population 1 to population 3 from the plant crop to the second ratoon. Tiller appearance was delayed more in high populations than in the low population.<br />Too dense or too sparse a stand also affected the morphology of the plants. High plant density and tall plants produced high stover yields but low grain yields. Dense stands lead to production of short panicles, less grain per head, low individual grain weight, and fewer panicle-bearing tillers. Plant height became more variable, and the uniformity of both plants and inflorescences was reduced.<br /><br />SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br />Origin, time of appearance, and survival of tillers of three sorghum hybrids (Mini-milo Br 54, NK 222A,<br /><br /></p>","","","full text added; relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench] appears to be a promising production system for the tropics as a means to obtain higher yields/ha per year. In sorghum ratooning, crops are continuously grown throughout the year, thus causing the plants to experience both photoperiod and temperature effects at different seasons. Indeed, seasonal effects are often more important in plant development and yield of ratoon crops than is the number of times a crop is ratooned; in previous studies, fourth or fifth ratoon sorghum yielded more in summer than first<br />1Journal series no. 1775, Hawaii Agric.

Yields are affected both by tillering and by differences in crop development (2, 5). Little is known of sorghum growth or development in high rainfall tropical areas, especially in relation to ratoon systems of management.<br />Sorghum cultivars respond differently when subjected to various daylengths and temperature regimes, since such responses are influenced by genotypic and environmental factors. Caddel and Weibel (1) observed that the effect of night temperature or daylength response depended upon both the cultivar and the day temperature. They found that higher day temperatures during heading influenced head production more than high temperatures at floral initiation. Qinby, Hesketh, and Voight (6) stated that the time floral initiation and duration of plant development are controlled by four maturity genes whose expression is influenced by both daylength and temperature.<br />Oat plants produced heads 4 to 9 days later when grown at 14.4 C compared with plants grown at 21 C (7). At 21 C, production of tillers decreased temporarily and then increased again as daylength increased. More productive tillers were produced as daylength increased. At the lower temperature (14.4 C), there was a higher total number of tillers when plants were subjected to short photoperiods.<br />Growth of tillers and leaves are closely related, and in ratoon cropping, the subsequent crops are dependent on the production of tillers. In a field with optimumplant population, productivity of the succeeding crop is greatly affected by the rate of’ tiller growth, and this in turn, is influenced by environmental conditions. Production of more tillers is most important during stand establishment of the initial crop. In a phytotron experiment by Hesketh, Chase, and Nanda (4), daylength, temperature, and light intensity, affected leaf numbers in three sorghum cultivars.<br />The purpose of this research was to study the effects of daylength and temperature on tillering and plant development of ratooned sorghum under controlled conditions simulating high rainfall tropical conditions where day temperatures in either summer or winter are lower than is usual in most temperate or subtropical, semi-arid or subhumid, sorghum producing areas.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS<br />This research was conducted at the Kauai Branch Exp. Sm., Wailua, Hawaii, using two growth chambers (Sherer Controlled Environment Laboratory Model Mg 4-4). Each chamber had two units or cabinets with separate light and temperature controis. In chamber no. 1, the night temperature was set at 15.5 C for 12 hours and 23.9 C for day. Thus simulating winter temperatures at Kauai Branch Station, which is located in an environment similar to sugarcane (Saccharum o[[icinarum L.) plantations that have phased out of production, and where<br /><br />479<br /><br />480 AGRONOMYJOURNAL, VOL. 67, JULY-AUGUST 1975<br /><br />sorghum may become an important replacement crop. In chamber no. 2, the temperatures were 23.9 C and 32.2 C for night and day temperatures, respectively, simulating summer temperatures at the station.<br />For daylength studies, the photoperiod in the first cabinet in chamber no. 1 was set at 10 hours and in the second cabinet, 14 hours. In chamber no. 2, the same arrangement was made in the first and second cabinets. Each cabinet had two 100-W incandescent bulbs and two 80-W fluorescent lamps, giving a total illumination of 736 lux at the plants’ upper surfaces.<br />To identify the treatments in each chamber in this study, the following designations were made:<br />TwLw Night temperature 15.5 C; day, 23.9 C; daylength 10 hours, simulating winter (w) temperatures and winter (w) daylength.<br />TwLs Night temperature 15.5 C; day, 23.9 C; daylength 14 hours, winter temperatures, summer (s) daylength.<br />TsLw Night temperature 23.9 C; 32.2 C; daylength 10 hours. TsLs Night temperature 23.9 C; day, 52.2 C; daylength 14<br />hours.<br />One-gallon (3.8 liter) cans were filled with fumigated soil. Three seeds of ’Pride 550 Br’ hybrid, a somewhat photoperiod insensitive grain sorghum, were planted/pot in October 1971. The plant crop was grown outside. Immediately after harvest (January 1972), the cans were placed inside the growth chambers. The check plants remained outside. Three cutting heights (C~ = 3 cm, C~ = 8 cm, and C5 = 13 cm) were used. The experimental design used was completely randomized.<br />Numberof tillers and plant height were recorded every week, and the number of leaves was recorded every 2 weeks. Leaf area was obtained by measuring the length of the leaf at its longest point times the width at its broadest part times 0.747. Heading dates were recorded when 50% of the heads were fully exserted.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />Due to low light intensity (736 lux) inside the growth chambers, the plants did not grow and repro-<br /><br />duce normally like those grownoutside. In spite of low light intensity, different daylengths and temperatures showed a rnarked effect on the morphology of plants in both the first and second ratoons (Table 1).<br />Light and Temperature Effects on Tillering<br />The effects of temperatureon tillering, ratoon behavior, and other plant characteristics cannot be isolated from daylength effects. The influence of daylength on plant development can be often altered or modified and can sometimes be inhibited by temperature (D. J. c. Friend, Univ. of Hawaii, Dep. of Bot. Sci., unpublished data). Kesults of various studies showedthat manyplants did not react to critical periods of photoperiod unless their thermal requirements were met. Whenplants were grown under alterhating temperature conditions at a 12-hour daylength, apical dominance increased with increasing mean daily temperature whether the higher temperature occurred during the night or day.<br />Table 1 shows that in the first ratoon when temperature was low and daylength was short (TwLw), there was an increase in tiller number/plant as the cutting height was raised from C1 to C~. However, fewer productive tillers developed in all the three cutting heights than when plants were grown under higher temperatures. In treatment T~Ls where there was no increase in either night or day temperatures, but where daylength increased from 10 to 14 hours, an increase in tiller number/plant and in productive tillers/plant was observed. Whenplants were subjected to higher temperatureand long daylength (T~,~Ls),<br /><br />Table 1.

II.<br /><br />481<br /><br />the numberof tillers/plant increased even more. Thus, both temperature and daylength influenced the tillering capacity of the plants.<br />In the second ratoon, ~ewtillers/plant were produced in treatment TwLw.Plants cut at the C1 height died after harvesting of the first ratoon crop. With higher temperature, but at the same daylength (T~L,~), the tillers with the lowest and highest cutting heights (C1 and C5) died. The same result was observed in treatment TsL~. The reason for this may be the combination of continuing respiration and reduced photosynthetic activity which exhausted the carbohydrate supply for the youngtillers.<br />Light and Temperature Effects on Maturity<br />Significant differences in dates of heading were observed in treatments T~Lwand T~Ls. Plants in T~Lw headed earlier than plants in TsLs, a response to short daylength. With low temperature and longer daylength (TwL,), it took the plants longer to head (Table 1).<br />In the first ratoon, plants subjected to low temperature and short daylength, matured late. With low temperature but longer daylength, plants matured somewhat earlier. Check plants headed and matured earliest. Therefore, both temperature and daylength influenced heading and maturity of sorghum. This confirms the findings of Quinby, Hesketh, and Voight (6) who reported that the effects of temperature on time of floral initiation of sorghumcultivars were different in long and short photoperiods, indicating interaction between temperature and photoperiod.<br />Light and Temperature Effects on Plant<br />Morphology<br />At winter temperature, but with longer daylength (T~,Ls), a greater leaf area, more leaves and more but shorter internodes, and longer panicles, were produced. Subjecting the plants to low light intensity, short daylength, and low temperature (TwLw)led little internode elongation, resulting in a short-stemmed or rosette form of foliage. This seemed to indicate that, under low temperatures, daylength and light intensity becamelimiting factors in the development of the plants.<br />Friend (3) found that increased growth of individual wheat (Triticum aestivurn L.) leaves was obtained by extending the photoperiod with light of low intensity. He concluded that growth substances participate in the control of leaf area expansion, which is subject to modification by the environment.<br />There was a reduction in leaf numberin every treatments from the first to the second ratoon. Anincrease in meanleaf area was observed in all treatments in the second ratoon, nmch more in treatments where plants died (T~L,~ and T~Ls). This could be due to less competition for light. The number of internodes remained almost the same between ratoons, but the mean internode length became longer in treatments in the second ratoon where plants died.<br /><br />_ Effects of Cutting Height<br />Figure 1 shows the effect of cutting height, low temperature, and short daylength (TwLw), on plant height. A C5 cutting height produced taller plants compared with the Ca and C5 cutting heights. Decreased plant height was observed in the second ratoon. Plants matured early under a TwLwtreatment. Plants with Ca cutting height died in the second ratoon.<br />The effects of winter temperatures and summerdaylength (TwL~)are shown in Fig. 2. Plants at C~ cutting height grew tallest and were harvested late. Plants with Ca cutting height matured earliest. As in treatment TwLw,shorter plants were produced in the second ratoon.<br />Plants under different cutting heights in treatment T~Lwdid not grow very tall compared with plants in other treatments (Fig. 3). In treatment TsL,, plants under all cutting heights grew tall during the first ratoon (Fig. 4). Plants with low and high cutting heights died early in treatments T~Lwand T~L~. It is possible that under very low photosynthetic rate the plants were unable to support growth, especially when the carbohydrate reserves were low. In treatment T~L,, more tillers/plant were produced, creating more demand for food. Except for treatment TwL~and the check plots, all treatments had dead plants at different cutting heights (Table 1). Death of plants took place between 2 to 9 weeks after harvesting the first ratoon.<br />The check plots performed differently from the rest of the treatments (Fig. 5). Plants cut at different heights of cutting (C~, C~, C~) produced tillers with height ranging from 95 to 105 cm. Plant height followed the trend of the height of cutting, producing taller plants with higher cutting. The same pattern was observed from the first to the second ratoon.<br />CONCLUSION<br />In sorghum, few studies have been made of the periods in which both light and temperature become critical to the development and reproduction of the crop. Such information is especially lacking [or sorghum in the higher rainfall tropics where day temperatures are lower and/or daylengths are shorter than in temperate or subtropical producing areas. Effects<br />of day.length and temperature in filleting and ratoon cropping are little knownor understood. This stud), investigated the effects of temperature and daylength on sorghum under controlled conditions.<br />Four combinations of temperature and light were used to simulate the night and day temperatures (T) and daylengths (L), respectively, of summer(s) winter (w) seasons at Kauai Branch Exp. Stn. Plants grown under these treatments were subjected to three cutting heights (C~, C~, C5).<br />With low temperature and short daylength (TwL,~), tiller number/plant was about the same as in check plants, but only one productive tiller/plant developed. Low temperature with increased daylength (TwL~) and high temperature with increased daylength (T~Ls) resulted in development of more tillers/plant and moreproductive tillers. Death of tillers first occurred<br /><br />482 AGRONOMJYOURNAL, VOL. 67, JULY-AUGUST1975<br /><br />175 T~Lw<br />150<br /><br />TEMPERATURE(T)<br /><br />t.nigh<br /><br />dey<br /><br />15.5°C<br /><br />2&amp;9°C<br /><br />LIGHT(L) I0 hrs.<br /><br />CUTTING HEIGHT (C) Cl (3.0 cm) C.~(8.0 era) C5 (l&amp;O cm)<br /><br />125<br /><br />~ I00<br /><br />5O<br /><br />~5<br /><br />II<br />24<br /><br />I/-~---~ C5 (died<br /><br />I 1 I I I I I I I I n n ~11 I i I I<br /><br />ii<br /><br />6 8 I0 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 58 40 42 44 4.6<br /><br />TIME (WEEKS)<br /><br />Fig. l.

Effects of temperature and daylengths.<br /><br />in treatment TSLW at the low cutting height (Q) in the first ratoon. Many plants under treatments TWLW) TSLW, and TSLS at Ci and Cs cutting heights died during the second ratoon possibly due to food exhaustion. Check plots produced fewer tilers/plant than did treatments TWLS and TSLS, but produced more productive tillers.<br />Check plants outside the chambers tillered better in summer when there was increased light intensity<br />and daylength; also they produced more productive tillers than plants in the chambers.<br />Plants subjected to high temperature and short daylength (TSLW) headed early, while at low temperature and short daylength (TWLW) plants headed late. Low temperature and longer daylength (TWLS) caused plants to mature early. Check plants matured earliest.<br />Plant morphology was also affected by temperature and daylength. Greater leaf area, more leaves/plant, more internodes, and longer panicles, occurred at low temperature and long daylength. At low temperature, short daylength, and low light intensity, a rosette form<br /><br />of foliage and reduced leaf number resulted in shorter plants. Abnormal growth and reproduction of these plants resulted in low grain and stover yields.<br /><br /></p>","","","full text added; relevant; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
