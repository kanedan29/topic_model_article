Reorientation towards more holistic approaches, including agroecology, has recently been backed by a global international assessment of agriculture S&amp;T for development (IAASTD). Understanding the past and current trends of agricultural S&amp;T is crucial if such recommendations are to be implemented. This paper shows how the concepts of technological paradigms and trajectories can help analyse the agricultural S&amp;T landscape and dynamics. Genetic engineering and agroecology can be usefully analysed as two different technological paradigms, even though they have not been equally successful in influencing agricultural research. We used a Systems of Innovation (SI) approach to identify the determinants of innovation (the factors that influence research choices) within agricultural research systems. The influence of each determinant is systematically described (e.g. funding priorities, scientists’ cognitive and cultural routines etc.). As a result of their interactions, these determinants construct a technological regime and a lock-in situation that hinders the development of agroecological engineering. Issues linked to breaking out of this lock-in situation are finally discussed.","July 2009","2014-09-21 02:42:09","2014-09-21 02:42:09","","971-983","","6","38","","Research Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evolutionary economics; Lock-in; Path dependence; Technological trajectories; Transgenic plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major soil abiotic stresses are divided into five sections (acidity, salinity and sodicity, alkalinity, soil structural problems, and waterlogging). In each section, the responses of cool season grain legumes to a particular stress are discussed first and followed by the major factors contributing to reduced growth and yield. The effects of these factors on symbiotic nitrogen fixation are considered separately. Each section of this chapter concludes by considering the extent of intraspecific variation in response to particular stress factor for the major cool season grain legumes.","1997","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","77-151","","","Volume 63","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","Donald L.

Sedimentation was controlled by an active NW–SE trending major normal fault along the basin's southern margin and by climatically-induced lake-level changes. Detailed facies analysis subdivides the entire Neogene–Quaternary basin-fill into three distinct litostratigraphic units representing paleogeographic changes and sedimentation patterns throughout the basin evolution. Sedimentation commenced in the late Miocene with the deposition of proximal–medial alluvial fan and fluvial facies (Damdere Formation; FA1). At this stage, alluvial fans developed in elevated areas to the south, prograding towards the basin center. At the beginning of the Pliocene, fresh to slightly alkaline, shallow lake deposits (FA2a) of the Karacaören Formation formed. The lake became open and meromictic conditions developed (FA2b). Pollen data from the FA2b facies show that climate was arid to humid. Climate probably changed cyclically through time producing alternation of Artemisia steppe (cold and dry periods) and more forested vegetation (warm and wet). The open lake facies passes upwards into lake margin facies (FA2c), but it was still dominated by alkaline to slightly saline lake conditions. Sedimentation was almost continuous from the late Miocene to Pleistocene. In the early Quaternary, the basin was dissected by the re-activation of basin bounding faults. The unconformable base of the overlying Quaternary deposits (Karacasu Formation; FA3) reflected the basin's transformation from a half-graben into a full-graben system. Oxygen isotope data from carbonates show an alternation of humid climatic periods, when freshwater settings predominated, and semiarid/arid periods in which the basin hosted alkaline and saline water lakes. Neotectonic activity has rejuvenated many of the basin-bounding faults, causing development of talus aprons and local alluvial fans. The basin was progressively incised by modern rivers that have largely smoothed out the topographic relief of the graben margins.","June 1, 2013","2014-09-21 02:41:14","2014-09-21 02:41:14","","62-83","","0","291","","Sedimentary Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Continental basins; Neogene; Paleoclimate; Pollen; Stable isotopes; Western Anatolia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of carbon (C) in ecosystems and determines the amount of photosynthetically fixed C that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. We present a method for estimating NPP and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n = 168). Mean S:R ratios for annual crops were highest for small-grain cereals (7.4), followed by corn (5.6) and soybeans (5.2), and lowest for forages (1.6). The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of ∼50% for annual crops and ∼75% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground NPP (BNPP) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The BNPP (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops (∼20% of NPP) than for perennial forages (∼50%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields. It can be readily up-dated with new experimental results and measurements of parameters used to quantify the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetically fixed C in different types of crops.","January 2007","2014-09-21 02:40:37","2014-09-21 02:40:37","","29-42","","1–4","118","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroecosystems; C allocation; C inputs; Natural ecosystems; Roots; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the likely growth of the world's population toward 10 billion by 2050, demand for food crops will grow faster than demand for other crops. The prospective climate change is global warming (with associated changes in hydrologic regimes and other climatic variables) induced by the increasing concentration of radiatively active greenhouse gases. Climate models project that global surface air temperatures may increase by 4.0–5.8 °C in the next few decades. These increases in temperature will probably offset the likely benefits of increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide on crop plants. Climate change would create new environmental conditions over space and time and in the intensity and frequency of weather and climate processes. Therefore, climate change has the potential to influence the productivity of agriculture significantly. Climate variability has also become a reality in India. The increase in mean temperature by 0.3–0.6 °C per decade since the 1860s across India indicates significant warming due to climate change. This warming trend is comparable to global mean increases in temperature in the past 100 years. It is projected that rainfall patterns in India would change with the western and central areas witnessing as many as 15 more dry days each year, whereas the northern and northwestern areas could have 5 to 10 more days of rainfall annually. Thus, dry areas are expected to get drier and wet areas wetter. It is projected that India's population could reach 1.4 billion by 2025 and may exceed China's in the 2040s. If agricultural production is adversely affected by climate change, livelihood and food security in India would be at risk. Because the livelihood system in India is based on agriculture, climate change could cause increased crop failure and more frequent incidences of pests. Therefore, future challenges will be more complex and demanding. This chapter focuses on the variability of climate change and its probabilistic effects on agricultural productivity and adaptation and mitigation strategies that can help in managing the adverse effect of climate change on agricultural productivity, in particular for India.","2014","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","65-121","","","Volume 123","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adaptation strategies; Agriculture; Global warming; Greenhouse gas","Donald L.

The potential to manage these diseases through intercropping eastern gamagrass with other, non-host perennial species was examined by monitoring incidence and severity on eastern gamagrass within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with wildrye (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tsvelev), two-species mixtures with Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacM., Leguminosae), and three-species mixtures with wildrye and Illinois bundleflower at two sites in Kansas, USA, from 1991 to 1995. Wildrye and bundleflower, which are also potential grain crops, are not reported to be hosts of the viruses. At Site 1, in 1991 and 1992, disease was generally less frequent and less severe in biculture with bundleflower and in the three-species mixture than in monoculture or the biculture with wildrye. No treatment effects were observed at Site 2. Disease severity was negatively correlated with plant size and seed yield at Site 1. Seed yield per plant was generally higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The results suggest polyculture may contribute to the management of aphid-borne plant disease within plantings of perennial grains.","October 1996","2014-09-21 02:40:14","2014-09-21 02:40:14","","139-147","","3","59","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aphid vector; Eastern gamagrass; Mosaic virus; Perennial grains; Plant disease; Polyculture; Tripsacum dactyloides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For outbreeding forage and turf grass species like ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), such resources have yet to be developed. Here, we present a model of the perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) genome on the basis of conserved synteny to barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the model grass genome Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) as well as rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). A transcriptome-based genetic linkage map of perennial ryegrass served as a scaffold to establish the chromosomal arrangement of syntenic genes from model grass species. This scaffold revealed a high degree of synteny and macrocollinearity and was then utilized to anchor a collection of perennial ryegrass genes in silico to their predicted genome positions. This resulted in the unambiguous assignment of 3,315 out of 8,876 previously unmapped genes to the respective chromosomes. In total, the GenomeZipper incorporates 4,035 conserved grass gene loci, which were used for the first genome-wide sequence divergence analysis between perennial ryegrass, barley, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum. The perennial ryegrass GenomeZipper is an ordered, information-rich genome scaffold, facilitating map-based cloning and genome assembly in perennial ryegrass and closely related Poaceae species. It also represents a milestone in describing synteny between perennial ryegrass and fully sequenced model grass genomes, thereby increasing our understanding of genome organization and evolution in the most important temperate forage and turf grass species.","February 2013","2015-06-01 16:22:21","2015-06-01 16:22:21","","571-582","","2","161","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means – such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry – does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research – which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents – as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency.

We calibrated a farm household model using 2009 survey data collected in northeast Gansu Province, China, and examined the responses of four different household groups. Household groups were distinguished based on the resources they possessed for either cropping, livestock husbandry or off-farm employment. We also calculated the opportunity cost of converting sloping land from grain crop production to perennial grass production and included the net value of the replacement crop in these calculations. Our model simulations indicated that subsistence-oriented households were most likely to participate in the SLCP, and that SLCP payment reductions could have large negative income effects for this group. Reductions in SLCP payments increased income inequality among households in the study area. Migration- and cropping-oriented households have fewer incentives to participate in the SLCP. With rising commodity prices, SLCP payments need to rise to avoid that subsistence-oriented households reconvert their land from perennial grasses to annual grain crops. Local government policies related to livestock production are being devised in Gansu as a method to lift incomes, and these policies could also have positive environmental benefits by increasing grass production on sloping land. The introduction of these livestock promotion policies had modest income effects but did not alter the area grown with grasses under the SLCP.","September 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:07","2014-09-21 02:40:07","","36-44","","0","40","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Farm household model; Grain prices; Livestock; Sloping Land Conversion Program","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we compare the distribution (Belgium and Britain) and abundance (Belgium, Britain and Switzerland) of formerly common and widespread native ladybirds before and after the arrival of Harmonia axyridis, a globally rapidly expanding IAS.Location EuropeMethods We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to assess the distribution trends of eight conspicuous and historically widespread and common species of ladybird within Belgium and Britain before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. The distribution data were collated largely through public participatory surveys but verified by a recognized expert. We also used GLMMs to model trends in the abundance of ladybirds using data collated through systematic surveys of deciduous trees in Belgium, Britain and Switzerland.Results Five (Belgium) and seven (Britain) of eight species studied show substantial declines attributable to the arrival of H. axyridis. Indeed, the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, declined by 30% (Belgium) and 44% (Britain) over 5 years after the arrival of H. axyridis. Trends in ladybird abundance revealed similar patterns of declines across three countries.Main conclusion Together, these analyses show H. axyridis to be displacing native ladybirds with high niche overlap, probably through predation and competition. This finding provides strong evidence of a causal link between the arrival of an IAS and decline in native biodiversity. Rapid biotic homogenization at the continental scale could impact on the resilience of ecosystems and severely diminish the services they deliver.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20 00:15:48","717–725","","7","18","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/CCF3ADMR/roy_invasive_2012.pdf","","","Biological control; biological invasions; Citizen science; Coccinellidae; Harmonia axyridis; population decline","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although land-use changes have been advanced as the major causes, the affinities of most wild pollinators with the main land-use types remain unknown. Filling this gap in our knowledge is a prerequisite to improving conservation and management programmes. We estimated the affinity of flower visitors with urban, agricultural and natural land-uses using data from a country-wide scale monitoring scheme based on citizen science (Spipoll). We tested whether the affinities differed among insect orders and according to insect frequency (frequent or infrequent). Our results indicate that the affinities with the three land-use types differed among insect orders. Apart from Hymenopterans, which appeared tolerant to the different land-uses, all flower visitors presented a negative affinity with urban areas and a positive affinity with agricultural and natural areas. Additionally, infrequent taxa displayed a lower affinity with urban areas and a higher affinity with natural areas than did frequent taxa. Within frequent taxa, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera included specialists of the three land-use types whereas Diptera and Lepidoptera contained specialists of all but urban areas. Our approach allowed the first standardised evaluation of the affinity of flower visitors with the main land-use types across a broad taxonomical range and a wide geographic scope. Our results suggest that the most detrimental land-use change for flower visitor communities is urbanisation. Moreover, our findings highlight the fact that agricultural areas have the potential to host highly diverse pollinator communities. We suggest that policy makers should, therefore, focus on the implementation of pollinator-friendly practices in agricultural lands. This may be a win-win strategy, as both biodiversity and crop production may benefit from healthier communities of flower visitors in these areas.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:16","2012-12-20","e45822","","9","7","","PLoS ONE","The whereabouts of flower visitors","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS ONE","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/8T2XGRH6/deguines_whereabouts_2012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using information on cat predation from the BNA, we found that species that glean their prey from the ground or breed in nest boxes were three times more likely to be depredated by cats, while birds that hawk were over two times less likely to become cat prey than would be predicted by random chance. Data from citizen science sources also showed that birds using nest boxes had increased susceptibility to cat predation, as did those that use feeders and that glean from foliage.

Prices of fuel are also escalating. With researchers and experts scrambling for the solution, biodiesel from vegetable oil will receive more attention. But the edible feedstock as the obvious cheapest choice will not be sustainable enough for the increasing energy and food demand; hence, there is a need for guaranteed feedstock. This study was therefore undertaken to explore feedstock that would not be suitable for food but useful for biodiesel in Africa. Among the highlight areas of the study include current energy situation in Africa, technologies of biodiesel production, current state of biodiesel in Africa, driving forces for increase in biodiesel production, current existing problems of biodiesel commercialization, potential benefits of biodiesel processes, need for non-edible oil plants, potential non-edible biodiesel feedstock, biology, distribution and chemistry of the selected non-edible oil plants. The study also throws light on the implication of biodiesel on the environment and the outlook. From the study, the use of non-edible oils can be guaranteed as sustainable feedstock for biodiesel since most of the non-edible plants can be grown on wastelands to reclaim them, not compete with food crops for limited lands, are relatively cheap, available and offer similar or even higher yields of biodiesel and fuel properties as the edibles. Developing biodiesel industry in Africa can help curb the high rate of unemployment through job creation as well as increase in income level of the rural populace. Weaning African economies from oil import dependencies could also be an economic achievement. It can be deduced from the study that there are promising non-edible oil resources in the system for biodiesel industrialization in Africa.","October 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:52","2014-09-21 02:40:52","","461-477","","0","38","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Africa; Biodiesel; Bioenergy; Feedstock; Non-edible oil plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relapse into low‐input agricultural ecosystems, however, will cause mineral stresses to crops, resulting in reduced food productions. Under such natural soil conditions, some endemic plants can tolerate the mineral stresses because they have evolved to adapt to the stresses. Numerous studies have been conducted to clarify the chemistry of the mineral elements of interest in rhizosphere and to utilize the tolerant mechanisms in plants. In this chapter, the authors reviewed the research progress on molecular scale mechanisms of Fe‐deficiency, Al‐toxicity, and P‐deficiency stresses in soils and their tolerances by plants. In low Fe‐availability conditions, two Fe‐acquisition mechanisms of plants have been clarified: enhanced Fe dissolution in rhizosphere by secreted proton/reductants/chelators followed by reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and specific uptake of Fe2+ (Strategy I) and Fe dissolution by secreted hexadentate Fe3+‐transporting molecule (phytosiderophore) by forming Fe3+‐phytosiderophore complex followed by specific uptake of the complex (Strategy II). Two tolerant mechanisms against high Al‐toxicity of soils have been reported: exclusion of Al from cytoplasm (exclusion mechanism) and detoxification of Al in plants (internal detoxification mechanism). Phosphorous acquisition mechanisms of plants from low P‐availability soils would be (1) alteration of root architecture, (2) secretion of organic acids, (3) secretion of phosphatase, and (4) enhanced expression of P transporter on roots. Some of the molecular mechanisms for the expression of the tolerances and their application to the genetic improvement are also reviewed.","2007","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","65-132","","","Volume 96","","","","Advances in Agronomy","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","Donald L.

Most of the current field trials that have been approved are focused on traits such as herbicide resistance, which in most cases could promote more intensive use of herbicides hazardous to the environment. Extensive research on risk assessment is either limited or nonexistent on nontarget organisms in agroecosystems in which genetically modified organisms are expected to be released. The following options are discussed in detail: (1) the B. T. endotoxine problem and the ecology of B.

This study used environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the potential savings of food-related GHG emissions that may be achieved with the establishment of an urban community farm, based on a case study recently found in the London Borough of Sutton. The work identified elements of the farm design that require the greatest attention to maximise these savings. The greatest reductions can be achieved by selecting the right crops: (i) providing the highest yields in local conditions and (ii) usually produced in energy-intensive greenhouses or air-freighted to UK from outside Europe. Implications from further development of the farm on the local, unused land were examined, taking into account market requirements. This showed that land used on an urban fringe for food production could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Sutton by up to 34 t CO2e ha−1 a−1. Although the percentage of this reduction in total diet emissions is relatively low, the result exceeds carbon sequestration rates for the conventional urban green space projects, such as parks and forests.","March 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:53","2014-09-21 02:40:53","","68-78","","0","111","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community farms; Greenhouse gasses; Life cycle assessment; Urban agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite over 200 years of scientific plant exploration, many plant species have yet to be discovered. Moreover, we still have a very poor understanding of the distribution of known taxa in this biogeographically complex region. We review the current state of biodiversity exploration, using plants in Indonesia as an example. Traditional methods of collecting and describing species have provided a solid foundation for our understanding of plant biodiversity, but are insufficient for the pragmatic task of rapidly discovering and documenting today’s biodiversity before it is gone, because general collecting expeditions tend to be infrequent, and documentation of most new species must await taxonomic revisions many years in the future. Solutions to this exploration and documentation crisis (i) could use the abundant resource of enthusiastic, networked, national biology students, (ii) should employ biodiversity informatics tools to efficiently engage both specialists and parataxonomists, and (iii) might require adoption of new types of α-taxonomy, utilizing increasingly low-cost molecular methods and high resolution photographs. We describe emerging technologies that will facilitate this taxonomic development. We believe that a new golden age of biodiversity exploration may be dawning, just as biodiversity itself is most threatened, and are hopeful that increasing knowledge of biodiversity will be a positive force to slow its loss.","2010-04-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","955-972","","4","19","","Biodivers Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/XG3AU9AT/webb_biodiversity_2010.pdf","","","Biodiversity crisis; Citizen science; Digital photography; Distributed databases; DNA barcoding; Evolutionary Biology95; Parataxonomists; Plant Sciences93; Semantic web; Species discovery; Species identification; Tree Biology94; Tropical forests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since scientific divers represent a small portion of the total number of divers worldwide, the use of non-scientific divers could drastically increase the number of observations needed to monitor broad-scale, long-term trends. Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species. In total, yellow stingrays were observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7% sighting frequency) with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2007—a standardized decline rate of −0.11. However, these trends were not consistent in all regions. The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions. Our results suggest large-scale changes in yellow stingray abundance that have been unnoticed by the scientific community. Thus, our study highlights the value of non-scientific divers for collecting data that can be used to understand population trends of otherwise poorly studied species.","2011-03-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","263-276","","3","90","","Environ Biol Fish","Spatial and temporal trends in yellow stingray abundance","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/TEFUTF2C/ward-paige_spatial_2011.pdf","","","Animal Systematics/Taxonomy/Biogeography101; Citizen science; Diver survey; Elasmobranch monitoring; Environment, general103; Freshwater & Marine Ecology102; Nature Conservation99; Population trend; Trophic interactions; Yellow stingray; Zoology100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most important first step in preserving migration resources—determining the migration flyways—is also the most challenging because of the large-scale nature of the migration. Prior attempts to determine the flyways using mark-recapture techniques with wing tags gave some clues, but this important information has never been fully obtainable until now. In 2005 the citizen-science program, Journey North, initiated a project that asked participants to record sightings of overnight roosts of monarchs during their fall migration, and this project now provides an ideal way to illustrate the flyways used by monarchs on their way to Mexico, with the assumption that roost locations indicate migration routes. We used 3 years of this data to elucidate the flyways on a continent-wide scale, that revealed two distinct flyways, but only one appears to lead directly to Mexico. This main, ‘central’ flyway begins in the American Midwest states and southern Ontario, then continues south-southwest through the states of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and finally passes through Texas and northern Mexico. These data also highlighted a separate, smaller flyway along the eastern and coastal states, but there was a noticeable lack of roost sightings in this flyway at lower latitudes. Since there are few recoveries of marked monarchs in Mexico originating from coastal areas, we compared the timing of roost formation in this ‘eastern’ flyway with the main, central flyway. Roosts in the eastern flyway lagged behind the central roosts in timing, suggesting that monarchs traveling in this flyway have a reduced chance of making it to the Mexico wintering site. Combined, our evidence indicates that locations in the central flyway should be considered priority areas for conserving migration resources.","2009-06-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-19 04:42:03","279-286","","3","13","","J Insect Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/AUFMSWV9/howard_fall_2009.pdf","","","Animal Ecology56; Biodiversity59; Citizen science; Conservation Biology/Ecology58; Danaus plexippus; Entomology57; Life Sciences, general55; Migration; Monarch butterfly; Roosts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That idea, however, contains a fatally weak point, when we consider the tremendous difficulty for primitive human to seed any cereal crop in the warm and humid climate, where weed thrives all year round. Instead of the accepted theory, we have to see a reality that vegetative propagation of edible plants is a dominant form of agriculture in such regions. The possibility is discussed that Job's tears and rice, two cereal crops unique to the region, might have been developed via vegetative propagation to obtain materials for medicine or herb tea in backyard gardens prior to cereal production. This idea is supported by the fact that rice in temperate regions is still perennial in its growth habit and that such backyard gardens with transplanted taro can still be seen from Yunnan Province of China to Laos. Thanks to detailed survey of wild rice throughout China for 1970–1980, it is now confirmed that a set of clones of wild rice exist in shallow swamps in Jiangxi Province, an area with severe winter cold. In early summer ancient farmers may have divided the sprouting buds and spread them by transplanting into flooded shallow marsh. Such way of propagation might have faster improved less productive rice through a better genetic potential for response to human interference than quick fixation in seed propagation, because vegetative parts are heterogeneous. Obviously, such a primitive manner of rice cultivation did include the essential parts of rice farming, i.e., nursery bed, transplanting in flooded field of shallow marsh like. Transfer from the primitive nursery to true nursery by seed may have later allowed rice cultivation to be extended to northern regions. In thus devised flooded cultivation there were a series of unique advantages, i.e.; continuous cropping of rice in a same plot, no soil erosion, slow decline of soil fertility, availability of minerals, and resulting in high yield per unit area, which have collectively attained the highly productive cereal cultivation in the warm and humid region. Rice cultivation in marsh is also favorable to raise fish culture, both of which constituted a nutritionally balanced base. Development of irrigation technology to construct flooded farms gave strong bases for stable rice-cultivating society, which in the end formulated the rise of ancient kingdoms of Yue and Wu in China in BC 6th -5th centuries. They were direct descendents of those people who had developed the unique rice cultivation from the era of Hemudu culture, which is dated back to 5 000 BC. Their movement to the south is considered to have established rice-cultivating communities in South China and Southeast Asia, while to the north it transferred the rice-based technology to ancient Korea and Japan and had established there a base for a civilized society.","September 2007","2014-09-21 02:40:33","2014-09-21 02:40:33","","161-171","","3","14","","Rice Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ancient kingdom; perennial habit; primitive agriculture; rice and fish farming; spread of rice cultivation; sustainable cultivation; vegetative propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implementation of such programs is impeded by a general decrease in the number of skilled naturalists. Here we studied how morphotypes, instead of species, might be used by unskilled participants (referred to as “volunteers”) to survey common plant communities. Our main questions were: (1) Can morphotypes be used as a robust estimator of species-richness (α-diversity) and assemblage turnover (β-diversity)? and (2) What is the robustness (reproducibility and repeatability) of such methods? Double inventories were performed on 150 plots in arable field margins, one by a non-expert using morphotypes, the other by a taxonomist using species. To test the robustness of morphotype identification among participants, 20 additional plots were surveyed by eight volunteers using the same protocol. We showed that (1) the number of morphotypes identified by unskilled volunteers in a plot was always strongly correlated with species-richness. (2) Morphotypes were sensitive to differences among habitats but were less accurate than species to detect these differences. (3) Morphotype identification varied significantly within and between volunteers. Due to this lack of repeatability and reproducibility, parataxonomy cannot be considered a good surrogate for taxonomy. Nevertheless, assuming that morphotypes are identified with standardized methods, and that results are used only to evaluate gross species-richness but not species turnover, parataxonomy might be a valuable tool for rapid biodiversity assessment of common wild flora.","2008-12-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","3485-3500","","14","17","","Biodivers Conserv","On the use of parataxonomy in biodiversity monitoring","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/C9DSZMXK/abadie_on_2008.pdf","","","Citizen science; Evolutionary Biology109; Inventory; Monitoring; Morphotypes; Parataxonomy; Plant Sciences107; Sampling bias; Taxonomy; Tree Biology108; Wider countryside","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through conducting a community survey, the project facilitated landholders to voice, develop and refine their understanding of remnant vegetation management, dieback and revegetation on private land. In doing so, landholders have improved not only their understanding of the issues but also their ability to act upon them. The empirical findings of the study highlight two issues of relevance to dieback on the East Gippsland Red Gum Plains. First, there is a perception that dieback has remained stable for at least 10 years. Second, scattered trees and small patches of trees are more vulnerable to dieback than clumped trees in larger patch sizes, as well as roadside vegetation. The research demonstrates the value of a community-based approach to NRM in terms of harnessing local knowledge, fostering human and social capital and engaging with interested landholders.","2007","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","145-159","","2","38","","","Building capacity for environmental management","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/BATRTQ3Z/measham_building_2007.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76%) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50–80%, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18 757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13 539 diving hours. The volunteer-sightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs. The successful development of citizen-based monitoring programs requires open-mindedness in the academic community; advantages of citizen involvement in research are not only adding large data sets to the ecological knowledge base but also aiding in the environmental education of the public.","2010-02-13","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-19 18:50:38","2170-2187","","8","20","","Ecological Applications","Unite research with what citizens do for fun","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/BBUMTA2P/goffredo_unite_2010.pdf","","","Biodiversity90; citizen science91; education92; environmental monitoring93; Mediterranean Sea94; SCUBA divers95; volunteers in research96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Kenya, cowpea Vigna unguiculata (Walp.) is grown in combination with cereals such as maize and sorghum, perennial legumes such as pigeon peas and root crops such as cassava and sweet potatoes. In the present investigations, field experiments were conducted to study the incidence and damage caused by Clavigralla tomentoscollis Germ. and C. shadabi, after flowering, on cowpea intercropped with maize. It was evident from the present studies that C. tomentoscollis and C. shadabi were more prevalent on cowpea during the first season rather than during the second season. Both species had a preference for feeding on cowpea intercropped with maize than when it was grown in pure stands. Consequently more pod damage was recorded on cowpea planted with maize. It was therefore concluded that this agricultural system, which is commonly practised by small-scale farmers in Kenya, is undesirable from the point of view of bug damage.","JUL-SEP 1991","2015-06-01 16:22:23","2015-06-01 16:22:23","","236-239","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","1ST CROPPING SEASON; 2ND CROPPING SEASON; CLAVIGRALLA; COWPEA; Intercropping; POD-SUCKING BUGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last century changes in human behavior and lifestyle have resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of diabetes world over. Though oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin is the mainstay of treatment of diabetes, they have prominent side effects and fail to significantly alter the course of diabetic complications. Lifestyle modifications including appropriate diet and exercise programs have been found to be greatly effective in the management of the disease. Diet therapy especially is showing a bright future in the therapy of diabetes mellitus. In this regard this paper reviews 27 common Indian plant food materials that have been reported to possess anti-diabetic properties. The food materials reviewed in relation to diabetes and its complications are: Cajanus cajan, Cicer arietinum, Phaseolus mungo, Phaseolus vulgaris, Aegle marmelose, Mangifera indica, Morus alba, Musa sapientum, Psidium guajava, Punica granatum, Syzigium cumini, Vitis vinifera, Allium cepa, Annona squamosa, Beta vulgaris, Cucurbita pepo, Ipomoea batatus, Momordica charantia, Allium sativum, Brassica juncea, Cuminum cyminum, Curcuma, Murraya koeingii and Trigonella foenum graecum. In addition to these food materials black tea, green tea and red wine have also been reviewed. All these plant food materials have been reported to have varying degree of hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic activity.

This study used photo-identification from community-contributed photographs to reveal patterns in movements, reproductive biology, and fisheries interactions in this species that have not been previously revealed through more traditional methods. At least 178 individual sharks were identified, and 26 movements were observed. These included movement distances of up to 26.4 km, movement rates of up to 3.27 km/day (9.8 km in 3 days), and movements that required the transit of a 140 m deep channel. Other animals showed high philopatry, being re-sighted at the same locality on multiple occasions (up to 13 sightings for one individual) over periods of up to 7 years. Females showed higher philopatry than males and were more likely than males to be found at shallow (<10 m depth) localities throughout the year. The proportion of male sightings at shallow localities was significantly higher in April and May than other months of the year, possibly due to males coming into the shallows to mate with females. A peak in sightings of late-term females followed by an abrupt decline suggests that pupping season is May into early June, and two females were observed pregnant in consecutive years despite evidence that the gestation period is approximately 1 year for this species. Nine percent of animals carried fishing tackle or exhibited jaw injuries associated with fishery interactions, with multiple individuals found dead after being hooked by fishers.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:48","2012-12-20","121-136","","1","93","","Environ Biol Fish","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/X2FMG6DT/whitney_movements_2012.pdf","","","Animal Systematics/Taxonomy/Biogeography71; Citizen science; Environment, general70; Freshwater & Marine Ecology68; Hawaiian Islands; Home-range; Mark-recapture; Movement patterns; Nature Conservation67; Philopatry; Zoology69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this review is to highlight the progress made and the new challenges which lie ahead. The foundation for this approach was the establishment of ‘response surfaces’ for the development and growth of tropical crops using controlled-environment facilities. The concepts of light interception and thermal time developed were then used to investigate the mechanisms responsible for overyielding in intercropping systems and genotypic differences in the drought adaptation of crops in the semi-arid tropics. The most significant achievements were in the understanding of temporal and spatial complementarity in intercropping and agroforestry systems and the development of plant growth models. More recently, the same concepts have been extended to the capture of below-ground resources in agroforestry systems and rain forests. The most serious remaining challenge is to extend this approach to studies of complex multispecies systems in the humid tropics.","July 24, 2000","2014-09-21 02:42:04","2014-09-21 02:42:04","","25-47","","1","104","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroforestry; Intercropping; Light; Resource capture; temperature; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A few years after the initial reviews of Kannaiyan et al. (1984), the disease was coming to halt. Despite earlier investigations on pathological and physiological characteristics of P. drechsleri f. sp. cajani, the nature of infection process and genetic basis of pathogen variability have not been clearly established. Therefore, information on the biology and survival of the pathogen is needed to devise effective management strategies. Attempts have been made to develop green-house and field screening techniques since three decades ago for identification of host plant resistance. However, only few pigeonpea germplasm and breeding lines belonging to cultivated and wild Cajanus spp. were found tolerant to PB. The recent frequent recurrence of PB epidemics in the major pigeonpea growing areas prioritized the search for higher levels of disease resistance. There is a need to study the biology of the pathogen, epidemiology of the disease and refinement of the resistance screening techniques and develop integrated disease management technology for the disease. In this review, the symptomatology of the disease, biology of pathogen including its variability, epidemiology, sources of resistance, other management options and available information on biochemical and genetic basis of disease resistance have been updated and discussed with the identification of future research priorities.","August 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:57","2014-09-21 02:41:57","","951-957","","8","30","","Crop Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biology; Epidemiology; Management; Phytophthora drechsleri f. sp. cajani","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field experiment was repeated in 2 years on a loamy sand in Denmark to investigate the possibilities for increasing N supply to the winter wheat by cutting and mulching the clover between the wheat rows. The clover was cut with a weed brusher on three different dates in each year. Intercropped wheat with unbrushed clover had a lower grain yield than wheat as a sole crop. Brushing increased wheat N uptake and wheat grain yields. Intercropping with two or three brushing dates gave higher wheat yields than wheat as the sole crop. The largest increases in grain N uptake, 21–25 kg N ha−1, were obtained for the brushings around wheat flag leaf emergence. The highest yield increases with a single brushing, 0.98–1.11 Mg DM ha−1, were obtained when brushing was performed during the stem elongation phase. The largest grain yields for treatments with two brushings were obtained with a first brushing at start of stem elongation and a second around flag leaf emergence. The first brushing probably provided N to increase the wheat leaf area index and thus the light interception, while the second brushing provided N to sustain the leaf area during grain filling and reduced clover biomass and therefore competition for water. Intercropping wheat and clover increased grain N concentrations by 0.11–0.39%-point compared with wheat as a sole crop. Intercropping may thus offer possibilities for improving the bread-making quality of organically grown wheat.","February 2006","2014-09-21 02:41:17","2014-09-21 02:41:17","","149-155","","2","24","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brush weeding; Grain protein; Grain yield; Intercropping; Nitrogen uptake; White clover; Winter wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas bioenergy crop production is highly dependent on water, bioenergy development requires effective allocation and management of water. The objectives of this investigation were to assess the bioenergy production relative to the impacts on water resource related factors: (1) climate and weather impact on water supplies for biomass production; (2) water use for major bioenergy crop production; and (3) potential alternatives to improve water supplies for bioenergy. Shifts to alternative bioenergy crops with greater water demand may produce unintended consequences for both water resources and energy feedstocks. Sugarcane and corn require 458 and 2036 m3 water/m3 ethanol produced, respectively. The water requirements for corn grain production to meet the US-DOE Billion-Ton Vision may increase approximately 6-fold from 8.6 to 50.1 km3. Furthermore, climate change is impacting water resources throughout the world. In the western US, runoff from snowmelt is occurring earlier altering the timing of water availability. Weather extremes, both drought and flooding, have occurred more frequently over the last 30 years than the previous 100 years. All of these weather events impact bioenergy crop production. These events may be partially mitigated by alternative water management systems that offer potential for more effective water use and conservation. A few potential alternatives include controlled drainage and new next-generation livestock waste treatment systems. Controlled drainage can increase water available to plants and simultaneously improve water quality. New livestock waste treatments systems offer the potential to utilize treated wastewater to produce bioenergy crops. New technologies for cellulosic biomass conversion via thermochemical conversion offer the potential for using more diverse feedstocks with dramatically reduced water requirements. The development of bioenergy feedstocks in the US and throughout the world should carefully consider water resource limitations and their critical connections to ecosystem integrity and sustainability of human food.","March 2010","2014-09-21 02:41:46","2014-09-21 02:41:46","","2014-2025","","6","101","","Bioresource Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bioenergy; Climate change; Water; Water availability; Water scarcity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly in layered soils, interpretation of ECa variations would be enhanced with better calibrations to depth-wise variations in these soil properties. Thus, the objective of this research was to combine point measurements of layer conductivity obtained using ECa-equipped penetrometers with mapped ECa data from proximal sensors for improved quantification of conductivity–depth relationships in layered soils. Data were collected from a set of large plots on a claypan-soil landscape in central Missouri which had been managed in grain and perennial grass cropping systems for 20 years. Soil ECa variation with depth was represented by both two- and three-layer models that were visualized and parameterized with the use of penetrometer ECa data. The three-layer model provided a more realistic representation of the soil profiles in the study area and provided similar topsoil depth estimation accuracy as the commonly used two layer model. Penetrometer ECa data also provided efficient and accurate (r2 = 0.92) estimation of calibration-point topsoil depth as an alternative to soil coring and manual determination. A key to accurate model calibration was selection of points from areas of spatially-homogeneous proximal ECa. Combining penetrometer ECa with proximal ECa data improved modeling of conductivity–depth relationships in terms of model selection, model parameterization, and model calibration.","May 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:15","2014-09-21 02:40:15","","12-21","","0","199","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Claypan; Electrical conductivity; Model inversion; Penetrometer; Topsoil depth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed at identifying primary and subsequent dune incursions and episodes of dune elongation by investigating dune geomorphology, stratigraphy and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Thirty-five dune and interdune exposed and drilled section were studied and sampled for sedimentological analyses and OSL dating, enabling spatial and temporal elucidation of the NW Negev dunefield evolution. In a global perspective the NW Negev dunefield is relatively young. Though sporadic sand deposition has occurred during the past 100 ka, dunes began to accumulate over large portions of the dunefield area only at ∼23 ka. Three main chronostratigraphic units, corresponding to three (OSL) age clusters, were found throughout most of the dunefield, indicating three main dune mobilizations: late to post last glacial maximum (LGM) at 18–11.5 ka, late Holocene (2–0.8 ka), and modern (150–8 years). The post-LGM phase is the most extensive and it defined the current dunefield boundaries. It involved several episodes of dune incursions and damming of drainage systems. Dune advancement often occurred in rapid pulses and the orientation of VLD long axes indicates similar long-term wind directions. The late Holocene episode included partial incursion of new sand, reworking of Late Pleistocene dunes as well as limited redeposition. The modern sand movement only reactivated older dunes and did not lengthen VLDs. This aeolian record fits well with other regional aeolian sections. We suggest that sand supply and storage in Sinai was initiated by the Late Pleistocene exposure of the Nile Delta sands. Late Pleistocene winds, substantially stronger than those usually prevailing since the onset of the Holocene, are suggested to have transported the dune sands across Sinai and into the northwestern Negev. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of vegetated linear dunes located along the (northern) fringe of the sub-tropical desert belt to climate change (i.e. wind) and sediment supply.","June 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:26","2014-09-21 02:41:26","","1649-1674","","13–14","30","","Quaternary Science Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dunefield; Israel; Late Pleistocene; Negev; OSL; Vegetated linear dune","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis to develop calibration models to predict the feedstock composition and the release and yield of soluble carbohydrates generated by a bench-scale dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis assay. Major feedstocks included in the calibration models are corn stover, sorghum, switchgrass, perennial cool season grasses, rice straw, and miscanthus. Results: We present individual model statistics to demonstrate model performance and validation samples to more accurately measure predictive quality of the models. The PLS-2 model for composition predicts glucan, xylan, lignin, and ash (wt%) with uncertainties similar to primary measurement methods. A PLS-2 model was developed to predict glucose and xylose release following pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. An additional PLS-2 model was developed to predict glucan and xylan yield. PLS-1 models were developed to predict the sum of glucose/glucan and xylose/xylan for release and yield (grams per gram). The release and yield models have higher uncertainties than the primary methods used to develop the models. Conclusion: It is possible to build effective multispecies feedstock models for composition, as well as carbohydrate release and yield. The model for composition is useful for predicting glucan, xylan, lignin, and ash with good uncertainties. The release and yield models have higher uncertainties; however, these models are useful for rapidly screening sample populations to identify unusual samples.","MAR 12 2015","2015-06-01 16:22:20","2015-06-01 16:22:20","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Biofuels; Biomass conversion; Cellulosic biomass; Compositional analysis; Enzymatic hydrolysis; FT-NIR; Herbaceous feedstocks; High-throughput assay; Multivariate analysis; NIR spectroscopy; PLS; Pretreatment; Reactivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was little evidence supporting the hypothesis that bumblebees tend to nest in the same site in consecutive years.

Phenology (the recording of seasonal events) in particular has provided scientists with important long-term data sets. These data are of increasing interest as indicators of climate change and its impacts. Most scientists treat the data as the object of interest, while less attention has been paid to the two-way process of knowledge creation, and the significance of the inner, personal part of that. Phenological recording provides an interesting window on this because it is relatively straightforward (and therefore involves a wider range of people than more technically demanding recording), and because it is linked to the climate change discourse (and therefore connected with emotional and moral framings of the situation). This paper describes the rise of popular phenology in the UK and explores these dynamically related aspects of knowledge creation by drawing on accounts in the media and by participants. It concludes that reflexivity and credibility are important aspects of both personal and interpersonal meaning-making, and suggests that attention to both subjective integration of data, and the scale of local cultures of knowledge, are important in understanding the potential for connecting networks of citizen science. Phenology therefore appears to have a particular role to play in public understanding of climate change, which extends beyond the merely extractive collection of data to a more deeply integrated connection between observation and meaning.","2009-05","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","173-179","","2","19","","Global Environmental Change","Traditional Peoples and Climate Change","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/PFEETSST/lawrence_first_2009.pdf","","","Biological recording; Climate change knowledge cultures; Public participation; Reflexivity; Volunteers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 3D numerical model (Delft3D) is used to analyze the effect of sediment-induced density effects on the formation of channel patterns using a highly simplified river geometry. Results show that the effect of vertical sediment density stratification and hindered settling significantly influence river channel patterns. At some critical concentration (the saturation concentration), vertical mixing is totally damped by the density gradients at the lutocline (a strong vertical gradient in sediment concentration). This increases the secondary circulation in the river channel significantly, which in turn promotes meander development. When the flow is not close to saturation, the main channel-forming process seems to be channel avulsion through blocking of old channels and subsequent channel cut-off. When the concentrations are so high that sediment is primarily held in suspension by hindered settling, sedimentation is so much reduced that channels are no longer blocked and therefore the river course becomes confined to a single meandering channel.","November 15, 2007","2014-09-21 02:40:46","2014-09-21 02:40:46","","297-316","","1–2","202","","Sedimentary Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Braiding; Delft3D; Hyperconcentrated flow; Meandering; Morphological modelling; River morphology; Sediment transport; Yellow River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using examples from the history of fireworks, this essay explores acts of observing natural and artificial spectacles between the sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries and suggests these acts of observation were mutually constitutive and entailed ongoing and diverse exchanges. The essay follows the changing ways in which audiences were imagined or expected to react to fireworks and shows how these also shaped experiences of natural phenomena. Both natural and artificial spectacles were intended to teach morals about the state and nature, yet audiences rarely seemed to take away what they were expected to learn. The essay examines how performers thus sought to discipline audience observation, before exploring, in conclusion, how spectacle provided a vocabulary for discerning and articulating new natural phenomena, and sites for the pursuit of novel experiments.","2011","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","167-182","","02","24","","","Watching the fireworks","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Journals Online","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/JQQ22P5A/Werrett - 2011 - Watching the Fireworks Early Modern Observation o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) were conducted in two consecutive years, with Aberdeen Angus heifers grazing continuously OP. In Exp 1, 24 heifers (204 kg initial-weight) were grazing 55 days. The treatments were: unsupplemented control (CON1), or 2 kg per animal per day of ground corn (CORN1), or 75% ground corn + 25% corn gluten meal (C-GM). In Exp 1 herbage mass of OP decreased from 1777 to 1209 kg dry matter (DM)/ha from July to September. The DM concentration averaged 296 g/kg of fresh OP, and crude protein (CP) was below 100 g/kg DM; initially NPN was 47% of CP, decreasing later. Ca increased with time from 3.5 to 6.0 g/kg DM, the other minerals were not affected by date. The ratio K/(Ca+Mg) was high on July (3.80 meq/kg DM) and decreased in August to September (2.73 and 1.94, respectively). Average daily gain (ADG) averaged 921 g per day for C-GM versus 670, 759 for CON and CORN1, respectively. A non-significant decrease in rumen pH was detected for CORN1 (mean of 6.26). Rumen NH3-N was not affected by treatment, being the highest value 4.44 mg/dl in September (P&lt;0.05). Plasma levels of Ca and Na were normal and not affected by treatment or date; Mg and K showed higher levels for CORN1 and C-GM versus CON1, K and P increased with date (P&lt;0.05). In Exp 2, 36 heifers (192 kg-initial weight) were grazing OP during 140 days. Treatments in Exp 2 were: unsupplemented control (CON2), ground corn (CORN2) and alfalfa hay (AH). The animals did not reach the targeted intake level for supplements. Thus, daily intakes resulted 1.57 and 1.06 kg per animal for CORN2 and AH. In Exp 2, herbage mass was 1600–1700 kg/ha in May to September, decreasing in October. The lowest DM content was 20 g/kg of fresh OP in May to June, increasing in July. Initial CP was the highest (164 g/kg DM), it dropped in July increasing again in October; NPN content was 28% of CP in May, decreasing in October. Ca content raised from 3.6 g/kg DM in May to 6.0 g/kg DM in October. K decreased but Mg, P and Na have not changed their concentrations with time. The ratio K/(Ca+Mg) for OP was highest on May (6.23 meq/100 g DM), decreasing in October. ADG for CORN was 872 g, higher (P&lt;0.05) than 718 g (CON2) or 781 g (AH). No differences were found for ruminal pH (mean=6.8); but for ruminal NH3-N the highest value was for AH (3.35 mg/dl), also varying with sampling date (P&lt;0.05). Plasma levels of Ca and K decreased with time, being in July 8.76 and 19.22 mg/dl, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Mg was not affected by either treatment or sampling date, P was higher for CORN2=7.91 mg/dl. Na levels were larger for CON2 and AH than for CON2, with 272, 282 and 256 mg/dl, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Animal performance was improved by both energy and escape protein supplementation. However, treatments did not appear to modify to a great extent ruminal fermentation patterns or have any effect on blood mineral levels.","March 31, 2003","2014-09-21 02:41:48","2014-09-21 02:41:48","","29-42","","1–4","105","","Animal Feed Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cattle; Oats pasture; Plasma minerals; Rumen parameters; supplementation; Weight gain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results We identify three frameworks for report-back in personal exposure studies: clinical ethics; community-based participatory research; and citizen science 'data judo.' The first approach emphasizes reporting results only when the health significance of exposures is known, while the latter two represent new communication strategies where study participants play a role in interpreting, disseminating, and leveraging results to promote community health.

How to assess the WUE of different management practices is becoming more important. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between instantaneous WUE, time-integrated WUE and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using different water and nitrogen (N) supplies. Three water levels and five nitrogen (N) levels with 15 treatments were set up in a pot experiment using PVC tubes with 1 m depth and 20 cm diameter buried in a field for two seasons. Biomass, root weight, grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET), gas exchange parameters and kernel Δ13C were measured to estimate the plant and leaf WUE. The results showed that the water regime and N supply strongly affected the aboveground and belowground biomass and WUE. The WUE was significantly improved when the N supply was increased from deprivation to higher conditions. When soil evaporation was prevented, the yield of winter wheat was linearly related to ET. The water supply had positive effects, while the N supply had negative effects on the gas exchange parameters. The impact of the interactions between the water regime and N supply on gas exchange parameters was significant, but an interactive effect of the two parameters on final crop yield and WUE was not observed. While both the water regime and the N supply had significant effects on the kernel Δ13C, the water regime had a greater effect on Δ13C than did the N supply. This study supported the use of the kernel Δ13C to evaluate crop WUE. However, the relationship between the instantaneous WUE calculated from the gas exchange parameters and the final WUE at yield level was not always consistent. A strong positive relationship between these two factors existed during the grain-fill stage when different management practices implemented their time-integrated effects on the crop growth. No such relationship was found during other growing stages. This study verifies that gas exchange WUE values at the grain-filling stage might provide a tool to assess the final WUE of different management practices.","March 20, 2013","2014-09-21 02:41:18","2014-09-21 02:41:18","","236-244","","0","144","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomass; Crop yield; Evapotranspiration; Harvest index; Root:shoot ratio; Root weight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the increase in crop production of irrigated rice–wheat system in SA has been impressive since the 1970s, the low water productivity (WP) has led to the depletion of surface water and groundwaters. In this chapter we have discussed the availability of water resources in SA, identified the positive effects of soil and water management and crop genetic improvement on WP, and then described knowledge gaps and research priorities to further improve the WP with special emphasis on wheat-based cropping systems in irrigated and rainfed regions of SA. A single approach would not be able to tackle the forthcoming challenge of producing more food and fiber with limited or even reduced available water. Integrating irrigation water-saving techniques (water-saving irrigation methods, deficit irrigation, modernization of irrigation system, etc.) with agronomic and soil manipulations viz., optimum irrigation scheduling, direct-seeded rice, alternate wetting and drying in puddle transplanted rice, raised bed planting, crop diversification, conservation tillage, crop residue management, and conjunctive use of good quality (canal) water. Improved soil water management practices for rainfed regions include reducing runoff, rainwater harvesting and recycling, conserving rainwater in the root zone by reducing evaporation losses, and optimal nutrient management. The low WP in farmer’s fields compared with well-managed experimental sites indicates the need for more efforts to transfer water-saving technologies to the farmers. In future we need to increase scientific understanding of the effects of agronomic management on WP across various soil and climate conditions; improve irrigation practices (timing and amounts) and methods (drip and sprinkler) based on real-time monitoring of water status in soil-crop systems; and maximize WP by managing water resources and allocation at regional scales in wheat-based cropping systems.","2014","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","157-258","","","Volume 127","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Conservation agriculture; Deficit irrigation; Irrigation scheduling; South Asia; Water productivity; Water resources","Donald Sparks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecologists have long been interested in the role of climate in shaping species’ ranges, and in recent years, this relationship has taken on greater significance because of the need for accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on wildlife populations. Bioclimatic relationships, however, are potentially complicated by various environmental factors operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that climatic constraints on bird distributions are modified by species-specific responses to weather, urbanization and use of supplemental food.2. Our analyses focused on 18 bird species with data from over 3000 sites across the north-eastern United States and adjacent Canadian provinces. We use hierarchal occupancy modelling to quantify the effects of short-term weather variation and surrounding urbanization on food stress and probabilities of detection, and how these fine-scale changes modify the role that climate has on the distributions of wintering bird populations at regional scales.3. Examining site occupancy and supplemental food use across the study region, we found that average minimum temperature was an important factor limiting bird distributions, supporting the hypothesis that the occupancy of wintering birds is limited by climatic constraints. We found that 15 of 18 species (83%) were more energetically stressed (had a higher likelihood of visiting a feeder station) as minimum temperature declined from the seasonal average. Because we found these patterns in populations that regularly visit supplemental food sites and were likely not food-limited, we suggest that resource availability is less important than climate in constraining wintering bird distributions. Across a winter season, local within-winter extinction probabilities were lower and colonization probabilities higher at warmer sites supporting the role of climate-mediated range shifts. Importantly, however, these relationships were modified by the degree of urbanization and species’ abilities to persist in human-modified landscapes.4. Our results suggest that urbanization and behavioural adaptation can modify the role of climate on bird ranges and should be included in future analyses of range shifts because of climate change.","2011","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","403–413","","2","80","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Authors.

In the last decade, growing controversies and conflict have arisen in the region regarding the adoption of genetically modified crops and the growing use of glyphosate-based herbicides. Even if the industry and the World Health Organization claim that glyphosate is a product of low-toxicity, an increasing body of scientific research shows severe health problems for villagers and farmers. In Argentina, many peasants, neighbors, environmental activists, as well as rural physicians, scientists, agronomic engineers and lawyers have asked for a ban or strict limits on the use of glyphosate-based herbicides. Using a case study, I focus on collective action between 1996 and 2011 aimed at changing “science-based regulations” for the commercialization and use of agrochemicals. I demonstrate that by implementing diverse and innovative collective strategies as well as promoting the creation of new scientific data, affected populations can achieve some degree of influence on decisions regarding risk. Even if social and scientific disagreements over regulatory frameworks for biotechnology in Latin America have been acknowledged in the literature, regulatory science has rarely been thought of as a field of social struggle where social movements can participate and promote change. This is an important contribution to the emerging field of studies focused on political collective action and social movements within science and technology [25].","May 2013","2014-09-21 02:41:38","2014-09-21 02:41:38","","79-92","","2","35","","Technology in Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Argentina; Bioeconomy; Biotechnology; Latin America; Regulatory science; Social movements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has clear environmental benefits in terms of the contribution to long-term datasets and monitoring, and it also yields social benefits, both to the participants concerned and to the wider community. However, there is concern that participation is not spread evenly across different social or ethnic groups in society, as is the case for other forms of volunteering. In this paper, we seek to develop a better understanding of the motivations and barriers affecting participation in wildlife monitoring, through a study of public participation in wildlife monitoring schemes in the UK. We integrate information from interviews with representatives of organisations running the schemes with the results of surveys of participants to identify organisational and personal perceptions of motivations and barriers, and quantify the socio-economic bias in participation. Our results show that people from socio-economically deprived areas are under-represented in recording schemes at both the national and local levels. Organisers of the schemes expressed a desire to change this, but felt unable to do so due to limitations of resources and the difficulty of attracting the necessary media coverage. The major motivating factors for current participants in wildlife recording schemes included the chance to make a positive contribution to conservation and personal benefits, which were clearly linked with health and wellbeing. Barriers to involvement include a lack of awareness of opportunities, a lack of motivation, a lack of accessibility of the schemes, both in terms of equipment or facilities and knowledge, and financial costs of participation. Although there are challenges associated with gathering ecological data through citizen science, including data reliability, our findings show that many recording schemes do indeed provide clear benefits to nature conservation and participants alike. However, biases in representation of participants persist, despite the efforts of many organisations to make their schemes more accessible. More work still needs to be done with groups currently under-represented in such schemes to understand and overcome the remaining barriers to participation, so that the personal and social benefits that arise from participation can be realised.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:43:01","2012-12-20","364-373","","6","20","","Journal for Nature Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/6WDBU5QC/hobbs_motivations_2012.pdf","","","Citizen science; Deprived areas; Monitoring; Nature conservation organisations; NGO; Public participation; Wellbeing; Wildlife monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rice is produced under both upland and lowland ecosystems with about 76% of the global rice produced from irrigated-lowland rice systems. The anaerobic soil environment created by flood-irrigation of lowland rice creates a unique and challenging environment for the efficient management of soil and fertilizer nutrients. Supplying essential nutrients in adequate rates, sources, application methods, and application times are important factors that influence the productivity and sustainability of rice. This review emphasizes our current, research-based knowledge of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Fe, Mn, and Zn management in regards to the efficiency and sustainability of lowland rice production and identifies where additional research is needed to bridge information gaps. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review describing the nutritional problems, nutrient use efficiencies, and the production strategies used for efficient nutrient use and production of lowland rice. While the soils, climatic environments, cultivars, and degree of mechanization may vary considerably among the rice producing regions of the world, the basic principles governing efficient nutrient use by flood-irrigated rice are relatively constant. A summation of best management practices should help scientists develop practical, integrated recommendations that improve nutrient use efficiency in lowland rice production systems.","2003","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","63-152","","","Volume 80","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bedload fluxes were obtained automatically at 1-min intervals using two Birkbeck-type pit bedload samplers aligned across the width of the channel. Flow depth and water-surface slope were both measured continuously and synchronously with bedload. Data for five flow events show that bedload flux varies considerably. Bedload flux is high when it is compared with other perennial streams. For a 15-min interval, maximum channel-average bedload flux was 0.83 kg m−1 s−1. Bedload records also show that there is no direct relationship between bedload flux and grain shear stress. The low correlation between bedload flux and hydraulics arises due to the different thresholds of initiation of motion for each flow event and the variable character of the bed between events. For two individual floods, there is a reasonable relationship between bedload flux and grain shear stress, in part, as a consequence of individual particle entrainment and patch movement over a stable coarse gravel-bed during moderately high discharges. These results demonstrate that the Birkbeck system functions well in a Mediterranean mountain gravel-bed stream with a longitudinal slope of 2%.","August 2000","2014-09-21 02:40:48","2014-09-21 02:40:48","","23-31","","1–2","34","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bedload flux; gravel-bed stream; Mediterranean mountain river; pit sampler","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent developments in techniques, such as QEMSCAN and MLA, have made them more applicable to the analysis of traditionally difficult gold-bearing ores and more accessible to the industry. These techniques are continuously challenged by the need of the industry to gain representative results, but a good understanding of their limitations can allow complementary techniques to be employed, validating the results and providing a comprehensive picture of how the mineralogy of an ore can affect its metallurgy.

We used marine bird strandings to assess the impact of entanglement in Pacific Northwest coastal net salmon fisheries. We compared the magnitude and species composition of fisheries-associated strandings (FAS) to baseline data collected at beaches monitored by citizen- science programs in Washington State and British Columbia, and to seabirds salvaged from gillnets during observer programs. Carcass encounter rates were 16.4carcasses/km [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2 to 21.7] for FAS and 1.00carcasses/km (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.14) for baseline data. Declines in fisheries effort were associated with decreasing FAS, although declines in at-sea seabird abundance may also be at play. Common Murres Uria aalge comprised most of the carcasses in both the FAS (86%) and bycatch studies (71%). Although the total count of murre FAS represented a small fraction (1.3%­6.6%) of baseline mortality accumulated for the Salish Sea over the same period, murre FAS added 0.2%­2.9% to annual mortality rates. Considering the effects of other natural and anthropogenic mortality agents on murres in the region, this species might benefit from further protection. Given the complexity of salmon fisheries management and the ubiquitous distribution of seabirds in the Salish Sea, we recommend the comprehensive adoption of gillnet gear modification to reduce seabird bycatch, a solution that may prove to be beneficial for the vitality of seabird populations and of the fishing industry.","2009","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","41–60","","1","37","","","Bycatch and beached birds","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/UDZ6G8W2/hamel_bycatch_2009.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The enterprise of science is undergoing deep and fundamental changes, particularly in how scientists obtain results and share their work: the promise of open research dissemination held by the Internet is gradually being fulfilled by scientists. Contributions to science from beyond the ivory tower are forcing a rethinking of traditional models of knowledge generation, evaluation, and communication.

The objective was to assess their capacity to regrow post-harvest and yield grain over successive years, and thereby identify characteristics common to the surviving breeding lines. Over the 3-year experimental period 61% of the 176 experimental entries demonstrated some capacity for post-harvest regrowth. Of 125 entries planted in the first two years of experimentation, 34% persisted to produce a second grain harvest in year 2. Three entries from 73 planted in 2008 persisted to produce grain in 3 successive years. In a subset of 87 entries that underwent cytogenetic analysis there was an association between regrowth ability and the presence of at least one whole genome equivalent (14 chromosomes) from the perennial donor species. If the wheat parent was a hexaploid (2n = 42), an entry required at least 56 chromosomes to achieve any substantial post-harvest regrowth. However, the presence of 56 chromosomes was no guarantee of a capacity to survive post-harvest. The morphology of the hybrid germplasm was highly variable for every trait assessed including grain yield, grain size, grain quality, harvest index, tiller height and head morphology; reflective of the diversity of pedigrees. Narrower kernels appeared to be associated with higher grain protein concentrations. Unextractable polymeric protein (UPP) correlates with rheological properties of the doughs; some of the experimental entries had very low UPP; the majority had high UPP suggesting useful flour, dough and baking properties. A high level of disease resistance was observed in the subset of entries tested for leaf, stem and stripe rust as well as wheat streak mosaic virus, indicating that further development of hybrid germplasm would be unlikely to pose an unacceptable disease threat to conventional cereal crops, particularly where amphiploids were deployed. The variability of the cohort and the presence of entries with desirable agronomic and grain quality attributes suggested a potential to breed and select for perennial wheat derivatives with commercially desirable characteristics.","July 11, 2012","2014-09-21 02:39:49","2014-09-21 02:39:49","","68-89","","0","133","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intermediate wheatgrass; Perennial wheat; Tall wheatgrass; Thinopyrum elongatum; Thinopyrum intermedium; Thinopyrum ponticum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially true in cropping systems experiments in which multiple management practices differ between experimental cropping system treatments. We conducted a cropping systems experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA, to analyze the effects of initial cover crop and tillage intensity on feed grain and forage crop productivity during the transition to organic production. We hypothesized that treatment effects of (1) tillage intensity (full or reduced); and (2) initial cover crops (annual rye (Secale cereale) or timothy/clover (Phleum pratense/Trifolium pratense)) on grain crop yield in a 3-year cover crop/soybean (Glycine max)/corn (Zea mays) rotation would be mediated by key agroecosystem function indicators (soil quality, weed pressure, and predatory arthropod activity). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to attribute yield variation to treatment effects and abiotic factors as mediated by these ecosystem functions. We found that tillage intensity had both direct and indirect effects on corn yields. Full tillage had a direct, positive effect on corn yields, a negative effect on perennial weed density, and negative effect on a soil quality indicator (labile soil carbon). Full tillage also had an indirect effect on corn yields as mediated by perennial weed density. The initial cover crop influenced predatory arthropod activity-density and perennial weeds in year 2 (soybean phase), but had no effects in year 3 (corn phase). Abiotic and site factors influenced crop yields and other ecosystem functions in both rotation years. Our results highlight the utility of analytical approaches that consider the relationships among agroecosystem components. Through the analysis of management effects on multiple ecosystem functions, our results indicate that managing weed populations through tillage in organic systems can have the strongest effect on crop yields, although short-term profit gains may be at the expense of long-term loss in soil quality and beneficial insect conservation.","May 1, 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:19","2014-09-21 02:40:19","","119-126","","0","189","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Beneficial arthropods; cover crop; Cropping system; Soil quality; Structural equation modeling; Tillage; Weed dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One simple and scientifically valuable contribution involves the reporting of sightings of tagged animals, but even in urban areas, such reports are relatively rare. We draw on two case studies of conspicuously tagged and iconic animals to consider human reactions to wildlife tags, and how these influence the likelihood of unsolicited reports. We evaluate potential strategies for increasing participation from this pool of potential citizen scientists and maximising the reliability of these contributions. In both studies, public reports contributed substantial and largely accurate data. We conclude that such reports are often of unique value, and that common sources of reporting error can be minimised by careful tag design and clear advice to participants. Effective information campaigns can have unexpected effects on reporting rates, but in general, communication is crucial to raising awareness and encouraging public involvement. New interactive web-based tools have the potential to dramatically increase public accessibility to information and encourage involvement by providing instant feedback, access to research updates, and encouraging the formation of clusters of citizen scientists.","2010","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","440-446","","5","37","","Wildl.

Key environmental problems in this region include water contamination by nutrients and herbicides emitted from cropland, a lack of non-agricultural habitat to support diverse communities of native plants and animals, and a high level of dependence on petrochemical energy in the dominant cropping systems. In addition, projected changes in climate for this region, which include increases in the proportion of precipitation coming from extreme events could make soil and water conservation in existing cropping systems more difficult. To address these challenges we have conducted three cropping systems projects in central Iowa: the Marsden Farm Cropping Systems experiment, the Science-based Trials of Row-crops Integrated with Prairies (STRIPs) experiment, and the Comparison of Biofuel Systems (COBS) experiment. Results from these experiments indicate that (1) diversification of the dominant corn–soybean rotation with small grains and forage legumes can permit substantial reductions in agrichemical and fossil hydrocarbon use without compromising yields or profitability; (2) conversion of small amounts of cropland to prairie buffer strips can provide disproportionately large improvements in soil and water conservation, nutrient retention, and densities of native plants and birds; and (3) native perennial species can generate large amounts of biofuel feedstocks and offer environmental benefits relative to corn- and soybean-based systems, including greater carbon inputs to soil and large reductions in nitrogen emissions to drainage water. Increasing biodiversity through the strategic integration of perennial plant species can be a viable strategy for reducing reliance on purchased inputs and for increasing agroecosystem health and resilience in the US Corn Belt.","June 2013","2015-04-05 17:53:34","2015-04-05 17:53:34","2015-04-05 17:53:34","115–128","","02","28","","","Using biodiversity to link agricultural productivity with environmental quality","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Journals Online","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/PK45MCXI/liebman_using_2013.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies that try to address this question suffer from flaws in sampling design, inappropriate metrics, and/or failure to measure biodiversity baselines. We discuss how these failings can be addressed, and what existing information tells us about the key debates on this topic. The evidence available suggests that trade-offs between biodiversity and yield are prevalent. While there are some wildlife-friendly farming systems that support high species richness, a large proportion of wild species cannot survive in even the most benign farming systems. To conserve those species, protection of wild lands will remain essential. Sustainable intensification could help to facilitate sparing of such lands, provided that as much attention is given to protecting habitats as to raising yields. We discuss the general circumstances under which yield increases can facilitate land sparing, recognising that policies and social safeguards will need to be context-specific. In some situations, bringing degraded lands into production could help reduce pressure on wild lands, but much more information is needed on the biodiversity implications of using degraded lands. We conclude that restricting human requirements for land globally will be important in limiting the impacts on biodiversity of increasing food production. To achieve this, society will need to integrate explicit conservation objectives into local, regional and international policies affecting the food system.","January 2011","2015-02-10 20:52:37","2015-02-10 20:52:37","2015-02-10 20:52:37","S62-S71","","","36, Supplement 1","","Food Policy","","The challenge of global food sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/8ITZGNUM/phalan_minimising_2011.pdf","","","Agriculture; Biodiversity conservation; Land sparing; Land-use policy; Organic farming; Wildlife-friendly farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis.

In Australian agricultural systems, this has the potential to deliver multiple benefits: increased whole-farm profitability and improved natural resource management. The profitability of shrubs was investigated using Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System (MIDAS), a bio-economic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. The modelling indicated that including forage shrubs had the potential to increase farm profitability by an average of 24% for an optimal 10% of farm area used for shrubs under standard assumptions. The impact of shrubs on whole-farm profit accrues primarily through the provision of a predictable supply of ‘out-of-season’ feed, thereby reducing supplementary feed costs, and through deferment of use of other feed sources on the farm, allowing a higher stocking rate and improved animal production. The benefits for natural resource management and the environment include improved water use through summer-active, deep-rooted plants, and carbon storage. Forage shrubs also allow for the productive use of marginal soils. Finally, we discuss other, less obvious, benefits of shrubs such as potential benefits on livestock health. The principles revealed by the MIDAS modelling have wide application beyond the region, although these need to be adapted on farm and widely disseminated before potential contribution to Australian agriculture can be realized.","May 2010","2014-09-21 02:40:24","2014-09-21 02:40:24","","187-197","","4","103","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Animal health; Carbon emissions; Economics; Erosion; MIDAS; Perennial species; Sequestration; Whole-farm modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research data were obtained on sandy loam Dystric Albeluvisols at the Kaltinenai Research Station of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture on the undulating hilly topography of the Zemaiciai Uplands of Western Lithuania to identity crop and crop rotations that would minimise soil erosion. Measured water erosion rates during long-term field experiments were: 5.4–17.0 Mg ha−1 under winter rye, 18.0–62.8 Mg ha−1 under spring barley and 44.4–186.2 Mg ha−1 under potatoes. Perennial grasses completely prevented water erosion. The erosion-preventive grass–grain crop rotations (&gt;50% grass) decreased soil losses on arable slopes of 2–5°, 5–10° and 10–14° by 77–81%, while the grain–grass crop rotation (&lt;50% grass) decreased rates by 21–24%, compared with the field crop rotation. The mean annual metabolisable energy accumulated by the erosion-preventive grass–grain crop rotations under optimum ground and fertiliser treatments on slopes of varying gradient was 96.7 GJ ha−1. This was 24.8% higher than under the field crop rotation and 20.2% higher than under the grain–grass crop rotation. The mean digestible protein productivity of sod-forming perennial grasses was 13.1% higher than the mean productivity of grass–grain crop rotations and 53.7% higher than the grain–grass crop rotation on slopes of 10–14°. The erosion-preventive capability of crop rotations depends on their structure and composition. The grass–grain crop rotations and sod-forming perennial grasses significantly increased soil aggregate stability compared with grain–grass crop rotations on 10–14° slopes, thus both these systems decrease soil erodibility. The main attributes of the proposed land conservation and sustainable land-use system were the careful selection of optimum erosion-preventive ecosystems (sod-forming perennial grasses or erosion-preventive crop rotations) with high erosion-resisting capabilities. These systems must vary in response to slope conditions. Such ecosystems assist erosion control and thus the ecological stability of the undulating topography of Lithuania. These results may have wider applicability on the undulating landscapes of the Temperate Zone.","April 2003","2014-09-21 02:40:29","2014-09-21 02:40:29","","129-142","","1","95","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Erosion-preventive crop rotations; Landscape; Lithuania; Temperate climate; Undulating hilly topography; Water erosion rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The in sacco degradation characteristics of organic matter (OM) and crude protein of herbages were measured in the rumen of cannulated sheep in order to calculate the availability of effective rumen degradable protein (ERDP), rumen by pass protein, metabolisable protein (MP) and the synchrony index (Is), which describes the efficiency of utilization of degradable nitrogen (N) and OM for microbial protein synthesis (MPS) in the rumen. In this study, all grain crops except maize had a ERDP/fermentable metabolizable energy (FME) ratio varying from 14 for millet to 23 for wheat, well above the ratio of 11 required for optimum MPS in the rumen of dairy cows. In contrast, maize had the lowest ERDP/FME ratio of 3, indicating that ERDP would be limiting MPS in the rumen. The availability of MP varied from 58 g/kg DM in maize to 153 g/kg DM in wheat and all forage species except maize were be able to meet the MP requirement of high-producing dairy cows (30 L/milk/day) provided they were able to consume 11 to13 kg DM/cow/day of the forage. The availability of MP from herbs varied from 95 g/kg DM in fodder radish to 163 g/kg DM in plantain, which would be sufficient for high-producing cows, however, most dairy cows could not consume sufficient forage to achieve these high levels of production due to very high nitrate content in rape (mean of 11.1 g/kg DM) and fodder radish (mean of 8 g/kg DM).","March 2008","2014-09-21 02:40:36","2014-09-21 02:40:36","","75-83","","1","114","","Livestock Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Grain crops; Herbs; Metabolizable protein; Rumen degradability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of N and its propensity for loss from soil‐plant systems creates a unique and challenging environment for its efficient management. Crop response to applied N and use efficiency are important criteria for evaluating crop N requirements for maximum economic yield. Recovery of N in crop plants is usually less than 50% worldwide. Low recovery of N in annual crop is associated with its loss by volatilization, leaching, surface runoff, denitrification, and plant canopy. Low recovery of N is not only responsible for higher cost of crop production, but also for environmental pollution. Hence, improving N use efficiency (NUE) is desirable to improve crop yields, reducing cost of production, and maintaining environmental quality. To improve N efficiency in agriculture, integrated N management strategies that take into consideration improved fertilizer along with soil and crop management practices are necessary. Including livestock production with cropping offers one of the best opportunities to improve NUE. Synchrony of N supply with crop demand is essential in order to ensure adequate quantity of uptake and utilization and optimum yield. This paper discusses N dynamics in soil‐plant systems, and outlines management options for enhancing N use by annual crops.","2005","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","97-185","","","Volume 88","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","Donald L.

To begin filling this gap, we digitized land cover information from aerial photographs for three Iowa townships (Orient Township in Adair County, Bloomfield Township in Clinton County, and Denmark Township in Emmet County) at five time steps between 1937 and 2002 and analyzed landscape change using a case study approach, landscape metrics, and graphical analysis. Results showed several consistent patterns across townships, including increased area devoted to row crops; decreased area devoted to small grains, hay, and grass; decreased numbers of farm fields concomitant with an increase in average field size; and a loss of rural infrastructure, such as farmsteads and rail lines. This generalized pattern describes an overall loss in agricultural landscape diversity over time, which is clearest in Denmark Township, while more detailed analysis reveals fine-scale diversification in Orient and Bloomfield Townships due to the adoption of conservation practices. A comparison of the three case study landscapes suggested that technology, economics, and federal farm policies, as meditated by variability in natural resource constraints, were drivers of the changes we observed.","April 15, 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:47","2014-09-21 02:40:47","","202-212","","3","100","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Landscape homogenization; Social-ecological systems; sustainable agriculture; U.S. Corn Belt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so we conducted a field experiment to determine if sampling earthworms using mustard-powder would reveal similar patterns of earthworm abundance and community composition as relying on the more difficult to prepare, and possibly hazardous, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) solution. Earthworms were sampled using either mustard or AITC in four pairs of 0.25-m2 plots located in each of four woodland sites that were predicted to exhibit a range of earthworm densities. Soil gravimetric water content (GWC) of each plot was quantified as a covariate. For analyses of changes in abundance and community structure, earthworms were classified as belonging to one of five groups based on where they occur in the soil profile, developmental stage, and level of taxonomic identification. The two sampling techniques revealed similar earthworm abundances and community composition across the four sites (all Ps > 0.16) and across the range in GWC (all Ps > 0.36). We conclude that using the mustard-water mixture to sample earthworms at our study site appears to be just as effective and reliable as using AITC. The mustard-water mixture, which is easier to prepare and is less hazardous than AITC solution, should, therefore, be considered as an appropriate tool to be utilized by researchers who collaborate with citizen scientists to help collect the large datasets needed to reveal how woodland management and restoration programs affect earthworms.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:46:16","2012-12-20","283-292","","3","32","","Natural Areas Journal","A simple, safe, and effective sampling technique for investigating earthworm communities in woodland soils","","","","","","","","","","","","BioOne","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/64EXF2SK/ionnone_simple_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In low-input and organic systems, there is greater reliance on complex rotations including annual and perennial crops, organic N sources, and internal N cycling that more closely mimic natural systems. These differences in farming system practices fundamentally affect N availability and N use efficiency (NUE) and could impact crop traits and breeding strategies required to optimize NUE. We assess genetic and environmental factors that could assist breeders in improving crop performance in low-input and organic farming systems by examining NUE in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Crop plants have often been bred for high N productivity, while plants adapted to low N ecosystems often have lower productivity and higher levels of internal N conservation. Breeders can potentially combine N productivity and N conservation through the use of elite and wild germplasm. Beneficial genetic traits include the ability to maintain photosynthesis and N uptake under N stress and the ability to extract soil N at low concentrations, perhaps through beneficial associations with soil microorganisms. In addition, breeding for specific adaptation to climactic and management practices so that crop uptake patterns match N availability patterns, while minimizing pathways of N loss, will be critical to improving NUE.","May 10, 2008","2014-09-21 02:40:16","2014-09-21 02:40:16","","89-101","","2","107","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cereal crops; Nutrient cycling; Perennial crops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A survey of the literature gathered from around the world show mean yield benefits of up to 20% or more. Much is known about the principal mechanisms responsible for these benefits, including effects on disease control, improved nitrogen nutrition and water supply, although researchers continue to be challenged by inexplicable “rotation effects” that have yet to be documented or fully understood. This review summarizes our current understanding of the ‘better-known’ mechanisms of crop rotation, and discusses other mechanisms (e.g. changes in rhizosphere biology, allelopathy or soil structure) that may help to account fully for the rotation benefits that have been observed by agricultural producers for more than 2000 years. Where possible we emphasise new techniques employed to investigate these less well-understood aspects of the “rotation effect”. At the farm level, the inability to capitalize on the benefits of break crops may owe more to economics, the availability of suitable break crops and the complexity of the crop response. Computer-based decision support tools have been developed to assist growers to apply the information gathered from scientific studies, although efforts to integrate this information at whole-farm scales are embryonic.","June 3, 2008","2014-09-21 02:41:21","2014-09-21 02:41:21","","185-195","","3","107","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","disease; Preceding crop; Rotation; Sequence; Soil biology; Structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is currently difficult to justify control measures, as there is little known on its ecology, impacts and distribution. Determining the current distribution is fundamental to managing introduced species, yet this is difficult with inconspicuous species such as H. smaragdulus, especially as recent introductions are often found in low densities. We demonstrated how a combination of approaches could be used to improve the identification of occupied locations in NSW, including bioclimatic envelope models, proximity to known populations, and observed habitat preferences. Members of the public were also trained to collect specimens and improve overall survey efficiency. Bees were collected using pan traps and sweep netting. H. smaragdulus was detected at 44 new locations, extending the known distribution from ~1,250 to 46,800 km2. While bioclimatic envelope models helped guide survey locations, species detectability was higher when observed habitat preferences and proximity to known populations were also considered.

Modern agroecosystems have tended towards high through-flow systems, with energy supplied by fossil fuels directed out of the system (either deliberately for harvests or accidentally through side effects). In the coming decades, resource constraints over water, soil, biodiversity and land will affect agricultural systems. Sustainable agroecosystems are those tending to have a positive impact on natural, social and human capital, while unsustainable systems feed back to deplete these assets, leaving fewer for the future. Sustainable intensification (SI) is defined as a process or system where agricultural yields are increased without adverse environmental impact and without the conversion of additional non-agricultural land. The concept does not articulate or privilege any particular vision or method of agricultural production. Rather, it emphasizes ends rather than means, and does not pre-determine technologies, species mix or particular design components. The combination of the terms ‘sustainable’ and ‘intensification’ is an attempt to indicate that desirable outcomes around both more food and improved environmental goods and services could be achieved by a variety of means. Nonetheless, it remains controversial to some. Scope and Conclusions This review analyses recent evidence of the impacts of SI in both developing and industrialized countries, and demonstrates that both yield and natural capital dividends can occur. The review begins with analysis of the emergence of combined agricultural–environmental systems, the environmental and social outcomes of recent agricultural revolutions, and analyses the challenges for food production this century as populations grow and consumption patterns change. Emergent criticisms are highlighted, and the positive impacts of SI on food outputs and renewable capital assets detailed. It concludes with observations on policies and incentives necessary for the wider adoption of SI, and indicates how SI could both promote transitions towards greener economies as well as benefit from progress in other sectors.","12/01/2014","2015-02-11 04:16:11","2015-02-11 04:16:11","2015-02-11 04:16:11","1571-1596","","8","114","","Ann Bot","","","","","","","","en","","","","","aob.oxfordjournals.org.proxy2.cl.msu.edu","","PMID: 25351192","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/46QNG6GF/Pretty and Bharucha - 2014 - Sustainable intensification in agricultural system.pdf","","","agricultural systems; crop yields; food security; green economies; hunger; natural capital; resilience; Social capital; Sustainable intensification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In S. halepense and in the majority of reported cases in L. rigidum the glyphosate resistance trait has been associated with a mechanism that reduces glyphosate translocation within plants. Here, the significant decrease in the glyphosate resistance level when resistant plants of S. halepense and L. rigidum are grown at suboptimal cool temperature conditions is reported. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry Results Lowering temperature from 30 to 19 degrees C in S. halepense and from 19 to 8 degrees C in L. rigidum significantly reduced both plant survival and above-ground biomass produced by glyphosate-resistant plants. Thus, glyphosate resistance parameters significantly decreased when glyphosate-treated resistant plants of both species were grown under non-optimal temperature conditions. The results suggest that the resistance mechanism against glyphosate damage is less efficient at optimal growing temperatures. Conclusion It is possible to increase the control of glyphosate-resistant S. halepense and L. rigidum populations by treatment with glyphosate during growing conditions at suboptimal low temperatures. Conversely, glyphosate failure will continue to occur on glyphosate-resistant populations treated during periods of higher temperatures.(C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry","February 2013","2015-06-01 16:22:21","2015-06-01 16:22:21","","228-232","","2","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","herbicide resistance management; reduced glyphosate translocation; resistance factor; resistance mechanism; temperature effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Characteristics of land categories inform potential land use change impacts as well as switchgrass profitability. Variable yields within and across land categories are translated into distributions of switchgrass net revenue. Breakeven curves are generated for a range of switchgrass prices. These curves provide upper bounds for further analysis of actual switchgrass adoption in context of broader economic forces and possible policy mechanisms to minimize environmental impacts. A farm-gate price of $55 Mg−1 is estimated for half of marginal and pasturelands to break even with switchgrass. At this price, only 20% of land in hay and a small fraction of row crop hectares break even. Half of hay and row crops hectares break even at approximately $90 Mg−1 and $100 Mg−1, respectively. At $60 Mg−1, sufficient land area can profitably produce switchgrass for ethanol to displace approximately 10% of gasoline consumed in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina; however, this price only indicates breakeven capacity implying that higher prices may be necessary to realize 10% displacement.","February 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:35","2014-09-21 02:40:35","","261-269","","0","65","","Energy Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cellulosic ethanol; Diffusion of innovation; Environmental impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It demonstrates that, on one hand, standards serve a boundary-bridging function that affords bucket monitoring data a crucial measure of legitimacy among experts.

However, considerable variation exists in the magnitude of response in published results. The purpose of this study is to explain the variation in response using a dynamic mechanistic model to predict observed N and milk yield results from the literature, and from simulated data. Examined effects were (1) water-soluble carbohydrate [WSC; g/kg of dry matter (DM)] increase; (2) change in crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the plant with WSC increase; and (3) the level of N fertilization. The database for evaluation of model N and milk yield predictions consisted of 4 published studies with 28 treatment means for which high-sugar grasses were being evaluated. Water-soluble carbohydrate content of the diets ranged from 95 to 248 g/kg of DM, CP content ranged from 115 to 263 g/kg of DM, and the NDF content ranged from 400 to 568 g/kg of DM. Urine N, milk N, and total N excretion were predicted well by the model and followed the directional pattern of observed values within each study. Simulation results showed that the N utilization ratio increased as the WSC content of the diet increased, but to varying degrees depending on the grass scenario examined. The greatest benefit in terms of N utilization ratio and urine N levels were seen when the WSC content of grass increased at the expense of CP, followed by a 50:50 CP and NDF mix, followed by a trade for NDF. Simulated milk yield decreased slightly when WSC increased at the expense of CP, increased slightly when it increased at the expense of a CP and NDF mix, and increased most when WSC increased at the expense of NDF. Results were amplified slightly under conditions of low-N fertilization and in the absence of grain feeding. Overall, modeling is useful as an explanatory tool. The variation from results in the literature with high-WSC grass feeding may be, at least in part, the result of the level of WSC (g/kg of DM) increase, concurrent changes occurring within the CP and NDF fractions of the plant, and the plane of nutrition of the diet (grain feeding and N fertilization levels).","June 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:05","2014-09-21 02:41:05","","3105-3118","","6","94","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","high-sugar grass; milk yield; modeling; Nitrogen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of reconciliation ecology, by which the anthropogenic environment may be modified to encourage non-human use and biodiversity preservation without compromising societal utilization, potentially represents an appropriate paradigm for urban conservation given the generally poor opportunities that exist for reserve establishment and ecological restoration in urban areas. Two habitat improvement techniques with great potential for reconciliation ecology in urban areas are the installation of living roofs and walls, which have been shown to support a range of taxa at local scales. This paper evaluates the reconciliation potential of living roofs and walls, in particular highlighting both ecological and societal limitations that need to be overcome for application at the landscape scale. We further consider that successful utilization of living roofs and walls for urban reconciliation ecology will rely heavily on the participation of urban citizens, and that a ‘citizen science’ model is needed to facilitate public participation and support and to create an evidence base to determine their effectiveness. Living roofs and walls are just one aspect of urban reconciliation ecology, but are particularly important ‘bottom-up’ techniques for improving urban biodiversity that can be performed directly by the citizenry.","2011-06","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1429-1437","","6","92","","Journal of Environmental Management","Urban reconciliation ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/EEQH7NWE/francis_urban_2011.pdf","","","Citizen science; green roof; Living roof; living wall; Reconciliation ecology; urban ecosystem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Strong feedback mechanisms which are independent of the environmental factor causing the stress increase both resilience and resistance, but if the feedback mechanism makes the population growth rate sensitive to an environmental factor, the amount of resilience and resistance under changes in that factor will be inversely related.

There were significant effects of site, treatment, and year on both aboveground biomass and seed yield. On average, bundleflower monoculture produced the greatest aboveground biomass, although the three-species mixture produced the peak biomass (814 g/m2) in any given year. Among treatments, Illinois bundleflower monoculture yielded the most seed (maximum=122 g/m2). Overall, biomass and seed yield were higher at the more fertile Site 1, but species differed in their dependence on soil fertility. Among species, bundleflower performed fairly independently of soil fertility, wildrye grew poorly on the less fertile soil, and gamagrass persisted at both sites although it grew less well at Site 2. In most cases, mixtures produced as well as the best-yielding monoculture. In 26 of 30 instances, biomass relative yield totals (RYTs) were statistically &gt;1.0 and, in 19 of 21 cases, RYT for seed yield was statistically &gt;1.0. In general, the overyielding effect appeared stronger at Site 2 than at Site 1, with seed yield RYT appearing to increase with time at Site 2. The results show that the seed yield of perennials can be high, and that some species can persist in mixture for several years. The data for 5 yrs point to the need to follow long-term patterns of yield and interspecific interactions within perennial grain polycultures in order to maintain species diversity and to make reasonable predictions.","March 1998","2014-09-21 02:39:46","2014-09-21 02:39:46","","1-11","","1–2","68","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Desmanthus illinoensis; Leymus racemosus; Perennial grains; Polyculture; Relative yield total; Soil; Tripsacum dactyloides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, feeding high-sugar grasses alters the pattern of rumen fermentation, and no in vivo studies to date have examined this strategy with respect to another environmental pollutant: methane (CH4). Modeling allows us to examine potential outcomes of feeding strategies under controlled conditions, and can provide a useful framework for the development of future experiments. The purpose of the present study was to use a modeling approach to evaluate the effect of high-sugar grasses on simulated CH4 emissions in dairy cattle. An extant dynamic, mechanistic model of enteric fermentation and intestinal digestion was used for this evaluation. A simulation database was constructed and analysis of model behavior was undertaken to simulate the effect of (1) level of water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) increase in dietary dry matter, (2) change in crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the plant with an increased WSC content, (3) level of N fertilization, and (4) presence or absence of grain feeding. Simulated CH4 emissions tended to increase with increased WSC content when CH4 was expressed as megajoules per day or percent of gross energy intake, but when CH4 was expressed in terms of grams per kilogram of milk, results were much more variable due to the potential increase in milk yield. As a result, under certain conditions, CH4 (g/kg of milk) decreased. The largest increases in CH4 emissions (MJ/d or % gross energy intake) were generally seen when WSC increased at the expense of CP in the diet and this can largely be explained by the representation in the model of the type of volatile fatty acid produced. Effects were lower when WSC increased at the expense of NDF, and intermediary when WSC increased at the expense of a mixture of CP and NDF. When WSC increased at the expense of NDF, simulated milk yield increased and, therefore, CH4 (g/kg of milk) tended to decrease. Diminished increases of CH4 (% gross energy intake or g/kg of milk) were simulated when DMI was increased with elevated WSC content. Simulation results suggest that high WSC grass, as a strategy to mitigate N emission, may increase CH4 emissions, but that results depend on the grass composition, DMI, and the units chosen to express CH4. Overall, this project demonstrates the usefulness of modeling for hypothesis testing in the absence of observed experimental results.","January 2012","2014-09-21 02:41:04","2014-09-21 02:41:04","","272-285","","1","95","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","high-sugar grass; methane; modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine factors that affect the incidence of these errors, we built an Internet-based survey that simulated avian point counts, and measured error rates among volunteer observers. Using similar-sounding vocalizations from paired rare and common bird species, we measured the effects of species rarity and observer skill, and the influence of a reward system that explicitly encouraged the detection of rare species. Higher self-reported skill levels and common species independently predicted fewer nondetections (probability range: 0.11 [experts, common species] to 0.54 [moderates, rare species]). Overall proportions of detections that were false positives increased significantly as skill level declined (range: 0.06 [experts, common species] to 0.22 [moderates, rare species]). Moderately skilled observers were significantly more likely to report false-positive records of common species than of rare species, whereas experts were significantly more likely to report false-positives of rare species than of common species. The reward for correctly detecting rare species did not significantly affect these patterns. Because false positives can also result from observers overestimating their own abilities (“overconfidence”), we lastly tested whether observers' beliefs that they had recorded error-free data (“confidence”) tended to be incorrect (“overconfident”), and whether this pattern varied with skill. Observer confidence increased significantly with observer skill, whereas overconfidence was uniformly high (overall mean proportion = 0.73). Our results emphasize the value of controlling for observer skill in data collection and modeling and do not support the use of opinion-based (i.e., subjective) indications of observer confidence.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:41","2012-12-20","76-86","","1","129","","The Auk","Observer Effects and Avian-Call-Count Survey Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","BioOne","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/89DS7S33/farmer_observer_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large datasets on genetic polymorphism that can provide an historical benchmark against which to test for recent evolutionary responses are very rare, but an exception is found in the brown-lipped banded snail (Cepaea nemoralis). This species is sensitive to its thermal environment and exhibits several polymorphisms of shell colour and banding pattern affecting shell albedo in the majority of populations within its native range in Europe. We tested for evolutionary changes in shell albedo that might have been driven by the warming of the climate in Europe over the last half century by compiling an historical dataset for 6,515 native populations of C. nemoralis and comparing this with new data on nearly 3,000 populations. The new data were sampled mainly in 2009 through the Evolution MegaLab, a citizen science project that engaged thousands of volunteers in 15 countries throughout Europe in the biggest such exercise ever undertaken. A known geographic cline in the frequency of the colour phenotype with the highest albedo (yellow) was shown to have persisted and a difference in colour frequency between woodland and more open habitats was confirmed, but there was no general increase in the frequency of yellow shells. This may have been because snails adapted to a warming climate through behavioural thermoregulation. By contrast, we detected an unexpected decrease in the frequency of Unbanded shells and an increase in the Mid-banded morph. Neither of these evolutionary changes appears to be a direct response to climate change, indicating that the influence of other selective agents, possibly related to changing predation pressure and habitat change with effects on micro-climate.","2011-04-27","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-18 19:12:40","e18927","","4","6","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS ONE","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/PQRCHE5S/silvertown_citizen_2011.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the feasibility of a perennial crop of Lesquerella is not clear because increases in seed-yield tend to reduce perennially. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of the source–sink ratio on seed yield and yield components in annual and perennial species of Lesquerella. We predicted that (i) due to differences in allocation patterns of annual and perennial species, seed-yield and yield components in perennials would be less affected by the source–sink ratio (higher stability) than in annuals and (ii) since seed-weight has been found to be the most stable yield component in other crops and their wild relatives, most of the variation in seed-yield as a consequence of source–sink ratios would be determined by changes in the number fruits per plant and the number of seeds per fruit. A field experiment was carried out in Chubut, Patagonia Argentina in a complete randomized design with four treatments to examine source–sink relationships in four species of Lesquerella, two annuals (L. angustifolia, L. gracilis) and two perennials (L. pinetorum, L. mendocina). We used either shading (reduction of source) or removal of flower-buds (reduction of sink) to develop a range of source–sink relationships. All four species showed a similar yield response to source–sink variations. Seed-yield was lower in shaded plants, although the timing of shading influenced this response. Flower-bud removal resulted in a significant increase in seed-yield. Seed-yield differences among source–sink treatments were best explained by changes in the number of fruits per plant than by the number of seeds per fruit. Source–sink manipulations had no affect on seed weight. Flower-bud removal significantly increased the number of fruits per plant in all species except for L. mendocina. The number of seeds per fruits increased only in L. pinetorum. Our results show that carbon stored during pre-anthesis plays a key role in reproduction both in annual and perennial Lesquerella. The increase in the seed-yield components found with bud removal could potentially reduce longevity in perennial species. The results also show that the number of fruits per plant is a good proxy for seed-yield within a species.","September 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:00","2014-09-21 02:40:00","","1393-1398","","2","34","","Industrial Crops and Products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon storage; New crops; Oil-seed crops; Seed-weight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, community groups and natural history organizations have collected many species lists. These represent a large, untapped source of information on changes in abundance but are generally considered of little value. The major problem with using species lists to detect population changes is that the amount of effort used to obtain the list is often uncontrolled and usually unknown. It has been suggested that using the number of species on the list, the “list length,” can be a measure of effort. This paper significantly extends the utility of Franklin's approach using Bayesian logistic regression. We demonstrate the value of List Length Analysis to model changes in species prevalence (i.e., the proportion of lists on which the species occurs) using bird lists collected by a local bird club over 40 years around Brisbane, southeast Queensland, Australia. We estimate the magnitude and certainty of change for 269 bird species and calculate the probabilities that there have been declines and increases of given magnitudes. List Length Analysis confirmed suspected species declines and increases. This method is an important complement to systematically designed intensive monitoring schemes and provides a means of utilizing data that may otherwise be deemed useless. The results of List Length Analysis can be used for targeting species of conservation concern for listing purposes or for more intensive monitoring. While Bayesian methods are not essential for List Length Analysis, they can offer more flexibility in interrogating the data and are able to provide a range of parameters that are easy to interpret and can facilitate conservation listing and prioritization.","2010-02-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","2157-2169","","8","20","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/99NMAGK4/szabo_regional_2010.pdf","","","avifauna84; Bayesian logistic regression85; birds86; citizen science87; conservation88; detecting population change89; historical records90; museum data91; presence-only data92; relative abundance93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure. A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns are then allowed to “scale up” via ensemble averaging to larger scales. This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird, an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).","2010-12-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","2131-2147","","8","20","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ZPF377DR/fink_spatiotemporal_2010.pdf","","","citizen science94; ensemble model95; exploratory analysis96; multiscale97; sample bias98; semiparametric99; spatiotemporal100; survey data101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Managing soil organic carbon (C) is central because soil organic matter influences numerous soil properties relevant to ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Even small changes in total C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil physical properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil C are important for ensuring sustainability of all soil functions. Soil is a major store of C within the biosphere – increases or decreases in this large stock can either mitigate or worsen climate change. Deforestation, conversion of grasslands to arable cropping and drainage of wetlands all cause emission of C; policies and international action to minimise these changes are urgently required. Sequestration of C in soil can contribute to climate change mitigation but the real impact of different options is often misunderstood. Some changes in management that are beneficial for soil C, increase emissions of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) thus cancelling the benefit. Research on soil physical processes and their interactions with roots can lead to improved and novel practices to improve crop access to water and nutrients. Increased understanding of root function has implications for selection and breeding of crops to maximise capture of water and nutrients. Roots are also a means of delivering natural plant-produced chemicals into soil with potentially beneficial impacts. These include biocontrol of soil-borne pests and diseases and inhibition of the nitrification process in soil (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) with possible benefits for improved nitrogen use efficiency and decreased nitrous oxide emission. The application of molecular methods to studies of soil organisms, and their interactions with roots, is providing new understanding of soil ecology and the basis for novel practical applications. Policy makers and those concerned with development of management approaches need to keep a watching brief on emerging possibilities from this fast-moving area of science. Nutrient management is a key challenge for global food production: there is an urgent need to increase nutrient availability to crops grown by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Many changes in practices including inter-cropping, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing crops, agroforestry and improved recycling have been clearly demonstrated to be beneficial: facilitating policies and practical strategies are needed to make these widely available, taking account of local economic and social conditions. In the longer term fertilizers will be essential for food security: policies and actions are needed to make these available and affordable to small farmers. In developed regions, and those developing rapidly such as China, strategies and policies to manage more precisely the necessarily large flows of nutrients in ways that minimise environmental damage are essential. A specific issue is to minimise emissions of nitrous oxide whilst ensuring sufficient nitrogen is available for adequate food production. Application of known strategies (through either regulation or education), technological developments, and continued research to improve understanding of basic processes will all play a part. Decreasing soil erosion is essential, both to maintain the soil resource and to minimise downstream damage such as sedimentation of rivers with adverse impacts on fisheries. Practical strategies are well known but often have financial implications for farmers. Examples of systems for paying one group of land users for ecosystem services affecting others exist in several parts of the world and serve as a model.","January 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:57","2014-09-21 02:40:57","","S72-S87","","0","36, Supplement 1","","Food Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aggregates; Biochar; Biodiversity; Carbon; Erosion; minimum tillage; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Nutrients; Organic matter; Phosphorous; Rhizosphere; Roots; Sequestration; Soil; Soil organisms; Soil structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires minimum fertilizer inputs for high yield, is very persistent, and is effective in reducing soil erosion. Sorghum double-cropped with winter annual rye was very productive but required more inputs than switchgrass.

It is the cause of a very objectionable taint in milk, cream, and butter. This weed is a serious pest in the grain growing areas of Manitoba, Sasketchewan, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Montana, and reports indicate that it is spreading. The characteristic odor develops when the seed is in contact with water as the result of the action of an enzyme known as mycrosin, which hydrolyzes particular glucosides found in the plant. Apparently both oil of mustard and oil of garlic are formed. It was shown experimentally that the ingestion by a lactating cow of French weed seed to an amount between 90 and 150 grams or of the green forage to the amount of 500 grams or more results in the characteristic taint in the milk. The odor is more marked in the cream than in the milk and is most pronounced in the butter. This may be taken to indicate that the volatile products unite chiefly with fat. The most pronounced results were obtained when the interval between feeding the seed and milking was 3 hours. The effect was reduced after an interval of 5 hours and completely gone by 12 hours. Feed containing French weed seed can be fed immediately after one milking without danger to the quality of the product from the next milking. The common methods used to eliminate feed tastes from milk are only partially successful in removing the tainting of French weed. The taint could be detected in the butter from mixed cream when 15 per cent of the cream was tainted. French weed may be readily detected in mixed feeds in proportions as low as 0.5 per cent.","July 1930","2014-09-21 02:42:27","2014-09-21 02:42:27","","308-318","","4","13","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the U.S. has enacted regulations – and adopted aggressive goals – to encourage increased usage of biofuels. Individual States (especially California) have taken even stronger positions with respect to biofuels. Initial efforts have focused mainly on ethanol, produced via fermentation of sugars from grains (especially corn). Today's R&amp;D focus is on “2nd Generation Biofuels” that are produced from a variety of biomass feedstocks utilizing a wide range of conversion technologies. This paper summarizes policy and regulatory drivers for biofuels in the U.S., describes usage trends and projections, and highlights major R&amp;D efforts to promote development and commercialization of 2nd Generation Biofuels. R&amp;D is being conducted in many areas, including biomass resource assessment, development of new biomass feedstocks, improved conversion technologies, and integration of systems. Other important considerations include fuel quality and specifications, as well as requirements for blending, distribution, and storage. Considerable R&amp;D, policy, and regulatory efforts are also focused on the energy and environmental consequences of biofuels. This includes not only direct emissions associated with vehicular uses, but also the fuels' life-cycle impacts with respect to total energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and multi-media effects. Due to the wide diversity of biomass feedstocks, conversion technologies, and systems integration approaches, the life-cycle impacts of biofuels can vary widely.","January 2009","2014-09-21 02:41:47","2014-09-21 02:41:47","","14-22","","1","34","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Energy policy; Ethanol; Renewable fuels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The organic, alfalfa, and unmanaged systems received no synthetic, manure, or compost nitrogen. Measured nitrate concentrations were combined with modeled soil water drainage to provide estimates of nitrate lost by leaching over 11 years. Among annual crops, average nitrate losses differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) and followed the order conventional (62.3 ± 9.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1) &gt; no-till (41.3 ± 3.0) &gt; reduced-input (24.3 ± 0.7) &gt; organic (19.0 ± 0.8) management.

Although D. saccharalis densities were relatively low, E. loftini average densities ranged from 0.3 to 5.7 immatures per m(2) throughout the 2-yr period.

Johnsongrass was the most prevalent host (41-78% relative abundance), but Vasey's grass (13-40% relative abundance) harbored as much as 62% of the recovered E. loftini immatures (during the winter). Young rice in newly planted fields did not host stem borers before June. April sampling in fallow rice fields showed that any available live grass material, volunteer rice or weed, can serve as a host during the spring.

As urban sprawl increases, it becomes urgent to construct a method to research and improve the impacts of management strategies for residential landscapes.

On-farm conservation is now widely acknowledged as a relevant strategy to reach this goal because it maintains evolutionary forces within and between the different components of the agricultural system. Seed exchanges between farmers play a key role in this process but are complicated to study over different agricultural contexts. This review begins by illustrating how interdisciplinary approaches combining ethnobotany and genetics helps provide a detailed analysis of the role of social and genetic dynamic interactions related to seed exchanges in traditional farming systems with farmer-led on-farm conservation. Secondly, the evolution of crop genetic diversity management is described in the context of industrialized farming systems. We follow the evolution of crop biodiversity perception by involved actors using a socio-historical perspective. After the agricultural shift from a traditional to a productivist model, recent social developments such as citizen science and participatory research movements are emerging and are strongly concerned by the question of biodiversity. These emerging trends which recognize and value seed exchanges between farmers show similarities to farmer-to-farmer seed exchanges in traditional farming systems. To what extent are these systems comparable? To fully benefit from studies in both traditional and industrialized contexts, it will be critical to develop an interdisciplinary framework to rigorously compare seed exchange systems and more generally farmer-led on-farm conservation strategies in diverse agricultural systems.","2011-03-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","321-338","","3","58","","Genet Resour Crop Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/IEMIGRFJ/thomas_seed_2011.pdf","","review","Agriculture95; Agrobiodiversity; Citizen science; In situ conservation; Landraces; Plant genetic resources; Plant Genetics & Genomics96; Plant Physiology92; Plant Sciences93; Plant Systematics/Taxonomy/Biogeography94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas, and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana density was low.

The taxonomy of Helianthus is somewhat confusing due to the complicated natural interspecific hybridization and different ploidy levels of several species. A germplasm collection of 2000 accessions, mostly annuals, has been assembled. Interspecific hybridization has become important as a means of introducing genetic variability into the cultivated sunflower. This has been facilitated by the use of embryo culture and chromosome doubling with colchicine to increase fertility. The wild species continue to serve as a source of cytoplasmic male sterility for cultivated sunflower. Molecular techniques of restriction endonucleases of mitochondrial DNA can be used to differentiate CMS sources. The greatest impact the wild species have made on cultivated sunflower has been in the area of genes for disease resistance and, to a lesser extent, resistance to insects. The recent discovery of genes for high tolerance to the disease Phomopsis/Diaporthe helianthi Munt. Cvet. is an excellent example. Considerable variability has been reported in oil content and fatty acid concentrations in the wild species as well as agronomic and morphologic traits of plant height, days to flowering and tolerances to stress, especially salt.","September 1992","2014-09-21 02:41:24","2014-09-21 02:41:24","1992-10-02","195-230","","3–4","30","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These increases in temperature have been shown to affect the phenological phases (phenophases) of plants and birds in Ireland, but less is known about the effect on the phenophases of Irish insects. Records of the flight periods of 59 species of Irish moths over the past 35 years (1974–2009) were obtained from a public monitoring group. Observations were analysed across the country using generalized additive models (GAMs) weighted by total yearly population numbers for each species. The results of the statistical analyses showed that 45 of the 59 species studied have a significantly earlier first sighting date now than when observations began. With this earlier emergence, 44 of the 59 species also have a significantly longer flight season over the same 35-year period. The extent of these changes varies across the country and by species life history. In particular, species emerging in spring are advancing at a much faster rate than species emerging during the summer. Many of these changes in first sighting are negatively correlated with rising temperatures in Ireland, particularly in late spring and early summer (May and June). The variation in phenological advancement in the moth species of Ireland is extremely complex and may be influenced more by species life history than by the phenology of interacting species, such as host plants.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","74–88","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 The Authors.

Perennial crops could also provide economically viable cropping option to farmers. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is an ideal crop for perennialization because of existing genetic resources and a wide variety of end-uses. The objective of this research was to evaluate interspecific hybrids between perennial Helianthus tuberosus L. (2n = 6x = 102) and annual H. annuus L. (2n = 2x = 34) for perenniality and agronomic traits; assessing their utility in developing a perennial seed crop. Field trials indicated that seed yield traits were positively correlated with head traits. Tuber traits, which are required for perenniality, and seed yield traits were not correlated, indicating that simultaneous selection may be able to target high yielding lines that also tuberize. The F1 individuals were intermated for one generation and the intermated F1 (IM1F1) showed increases in head size (up to 20%) compared to the best F1 individual. The lack of correlation between tuber and seed traits coupled with phenotypic improvement after one generation of intermating suggest that the best improvement strategy for perennial sunflower is a recurrent selection program focusing on yield.","January 2014","2014-09-21 02:39:47","2014-09-21 02:39:47","","254-264","","0","155","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem services; Flow cytometry; Helianthus; Interspecific hybridization; Perennial grain; Phenotypic correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phenological stages represented the diversity of plant development stages E.loftini may encounter. Plant fresh biomass, dry biomass, and sum of tiller heights were used as measures of plant availability. Accounting for plant availability, rice was preferred over non-crop hosts, and intermediate and older plants were preferred over young plants. Johnsongrass and vaseygrass were 3260% as preferred as rice when considering the most preferred phenological stages of each host. Brome and ryegrass received few or no eggs, respectively. Eoreuma loftini larval development (in degree days above developmental threshold temperatures) was fastest on rice and slowest on johnsongrass and vaseygrass.

There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by “planned” and “associated” biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.","July 2012","2015-02-10 23:14:05","2015-02-10 23:14:05","2015-02-10 23:14:05","53-59","","1","151","","Biological Conservation","","ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION: ESSAYS IN HONOR OF NAVJOT SODHI","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/BVX6RZB5/tscharntke_global_2012.pdf","","","Biofuel directive; Food wastage; Land grabbing; Land sparing vs sharing; Wildlife-friendly farming; Yield-biodiversity trade offs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five distinct lake shorelines (Lake Levels 0–4) are visible on digital elevation models, ranging in elevation from around 70 m to 30 m above sea level. The Bungunnia Limestone is preserved on the three lowest terraces ranging over 20 m in elevation (Lake Levels 2–4). On the two higher of these terraces Bungunnia Limestone contains ooids and stromatolites and is calcite- and aragonite-dominated whereas on the lower terrace level Bungunnia Limestone is dolomite-, gypsum- and magnesite-dominated and preserves tepee structures and mud-cracks. Thus, lacustrine conditions are interpreted to have become increasingly saline and evaporitic over time reflecting an overall trend to more arid climatic regimes. The highest lake level (Level 0 at around 70 m above sea level) appears to relate to a period of significantly increased rainfall that allowed the lake to overflow for the first time, marking the initiation of the modern Murray River. Subsequently, the lake fluctuated between: (1) a steady-state open lake system where water was overflowing across the Padthaway High spillpoint and active gorge cutting was proceeding, and (2) a closed lake system with no overflow that resulted in carbonate-precipitating conditions. During (1), shoreline erosion was occurring within the basin providing the terraces on which the Bungunnia Limestone carbonates were deposited during (2). In this, (1) is likely to correspond with significantly wetter Late Pleistocene interglacial and (2) with arid glacial conditions. The formation of the modern Murray River and the demise of palaeo megalake Bungunnia were therefore consequences of a combination of gorge cutting and increasing aridity resulting from interglacial–glacial climate oscillation superimposed on significant overall climatic change.","February 1, 2012","2014-09-21 02:41:28","2014-09-21 02:41:28","","114-127","","0","317–318","","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aridity; Bungunnia limestone; Lacustrine carbonate; Lake Bungunnia; Palaeoclimate; Stratigraphy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most crop production systems in the United States are characterized by low species and management diversity, high use of fossil energy and agrichemicals, and large negative impacts on the environment. We hypothesized that cropping system diversification would promote ecosystem services that would supplement, and eventually displace, synthetic external inputs used to maintain crop productivity. To test this, we conducted a field study from 2003–2011 in Iowa that included three contrasting systems varying in length of crop sequence and inputs. We compared a conventionally managed 2-yr rotation (maize-soybean) that received fertilizers and herbicides at rates comparable to those used on nearby farms with two more diverse cropping systems: a 3-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + red clover) and a 4-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + alfalfa-alfalfa) managed with lower synthetic N fertilizer and herbicide inputs and periodic applications of cattle manure. Grain yields, mass of harvested products, and profit in the more diverse systems were similar to, or greater than, those in the conventional system, despite reductions of agrichemical inputs. Weeds were suppressed effectively in all systems, but freshwater toxicity of the more diverse systems was two orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional system. Results of our study indicate that more diverse cropping systems can use small amounts of synthetic agrichemical inputs as powerful tools with which to tune, rather than drive, agroecosystem performance, while meeting or exceeding the performance of less diverse systems.","October 10, 2012","2015-04-05 18:03:55","2015-04-05 18:03:55","2015-04-05 18:03:55","e47149","","10","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/UHNE26U2/davis_increasing_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This gradient can be used to refine the citizen–science concept and allow researchers to differentiate between community members with expert knowledge and those with little knowledge. We propose that work would benefit from the inclusion of select local experts because it would allow researchers to harness the benefits of local involvement while maintaining or improving data quality.

As an incremental step towards dissecting the genetics of perennialism, a segregating F4 heterogeneous inbred family derived from a cross between S. bicolor and S. propinquum was phenotyped in both field and greenhouse environments for traits related to over-wintering and rhizome formation. An unseasonably cold winter in 2011 provided high selection pressure, and hence 74.8 % of the population did not survive. This severe selection pressure for cold tolerance allowed the resolution of two previously unidentified over-wintering quantitative trait locus (QTL) and more powerful correlation models than previously reported. Conflicting with previous reports, a maximum of 33 % of over-wintering variation could be explained by above-ground shoot formation from rhizomes; however, every over-wintering plant exhibited rhizome growth. Thus, while rhizome formation is required for over-wintering, other factors also determine survival in this interspecific population. The fine mapping of a previously reported rhizome QTL on sorghum chromosome SBI-01 was conducted by targeting this genomic region with additional simple sequence repeat markers. Fine mapping reduced the 2-LOD rhizome QTL interval from similar to 59 to similar to 14.5 Mb, which represents a 75 % reduction in physical distance and a 53 % reduction in the number of putative genes in the locus.","January 2013","2015-06-01 16:22:21","2015-06-01 16:22:21","","153-162","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Perennialism; Perenniality; Rhizomes; Sorghum; Sorghum propinquum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its sand bodies represent the largest and more important reservoirs in the Recôncavo Basin, hosting 362 million m3 of oil in place. The main goal of this paper is to provide a detailed stratigraphic analysis of the Sergi Formation based on core and outcrop data. It was achieved through the recognition and correlation of regional surfaces that have allowed the subdivision of this unit into distinct depositional sequences, and the reconstruction of its depositional history. The studied succession can be subdivided into three unconformity-bounded sequences. Sequence I is composed of lacustrine mudstone at its base, which is overlain by fine- to medium-grained sandstone related to aeolian dune and sand sheet and ephemeral fluvial stream deposits. Fluvial strata indicate northeastward-flowing streams whereas aeolian dune deposits suggest the action of southwestward-blowing winds. The regional unconformity bounding sequences I and II denotes both a climate change and tectonic rearrangement of the basin. This surface delineates a change in the depositional style, from fluvial–aeolian–lacustrine (Sequence I) to entirely fluvial (Sequence II). The latter includes coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstone deposited within northwestward-flowing braided channel-belts. Changes in fluvial palaeocurrent, from sequence I to II, indicate rearrangement of the drainage system related to basin tectonism. Furthermore, a change in the fluvial discharge regime took place as a result of a change from a drier to a wetter climate. Fluvial deposition in Sequence I was related to ephemeral streams whereas fluvial facies architecture of the Sequence II deposits indicates perennial braided streams with significant discharge variation. Another regional unconformity, this time related to a stratigraphic base level fall and consequent widespread, basinwide aeolian deflation, separates the braided fluvial facies of Sequence II from the fine- to medium-grained sandstones ascribed to sheet-floods, aeolian dunes and aeolian sand sheets of Sequence III. The resumption of aeolian sedimentation indicates a return to drier conditions in the basin. The abrupt change from fluvial–aeolian deposits to the lacustrine deposits of the overlying Itaparica Formation suggest a rapid rise of the water table and consequent basinwide flooding.","February 1, 2007","2014-09-21 02:41:13","2014-09-21 02:41:13","","169-193","","3–4","194","","Sedimentary Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Continental sequence stratigraphy; Reconcavo Basin; Upper Jurassic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This group mainly consists of sugars, polyols, amino acids, and betaines. Together, they shield plants by exercising a number of physiological responses such as membrane integrity strengthening, enzymatic/antioxidant activity balancing, and water adjustments under various abiotic stresses (e.g., temperature fluctuations, water deficit, salinity, heavy metals) and, more recently, pesticide exposure. Crop plant cultivation across the globe needs such comprehensive protection strategies against a vast array of ever-changing environmental conditions by developing tolerance at genetic and molecular levels. Currently, this is being achieved via osmoprotectant genetic engineering of plant genomes and exogenous application of antistress agents to crop plants to obtain high-yield, stress-resistant varieties. A newer modification to this two-dimensional approach is osmoprotectant activation via “omics”—an integral approach comprised of genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics.

This high potential arises out of the combination of cool temperatures and long photoperiods which favours the prolonged interception of solar radiation by extending the duration of the leaf canopy. In practice, realisation of this potential depends primarily on soil water conditions, which, in turn, determine dates of planting and harvesting, thereby delimiting the actual, as distinct from the potential, growing season. The fitting of the new crop to the actual growing season, or the development of strategies to avoid or tolerate the effects of wet soils in spring and autumn must therefore be primary aims in the selection of new varieties or species for Scotland. Four possible approaches, each of which has been used with success elsewhere, are reviewed, namely : the empirical approach, agrometeorological modelling, the adoption of perennial crops, and the use of crops yielding products of high value. Although at least three of these strategies have received attention over the last decade, only the empirical approach has had a significant influence on the proportions of species grown in Scotland (changes in areas of winter cereals, oilseeds and peas). It is concluded that, to date, crop physiology has contributed very little to the formulation of new cropping systems. However, crop physiology has made an important contribution in the interpretation of high yields at higher latitudes, pointing to a new set of arable energy crops for the next century, when supplies of fossil fuels will dwindle. In the meantime, investment in the development of such crops will depend upon policies for the pricing of fossil fuels and the use of surplus arable land in the EC.","1993","2014-09-21 02:40:55","2014-09-21 02:40:55","","161-171","","3","2","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alternative crops; crop physiology; daylength; Scotland; soil water relations; temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different mechanisms of drought-tolerance have been reported for several plant species including maize. However, the differences in global gene expression between drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes and their relationship to physiological adaptations to drought are largely unknown. The study of the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and susceptible genotypes could provide important information to design more efficient breeding programs to produce maize varieties better adapted to water limiting conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Changes in physiological responses and gene expression patterns were studied under drought stress and recovery in three Mexican maize landraces which included two drought tolerant (Cajete criollo and Michoacán 21) and one susceptible (85-2) genotypes. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, soil and leaf water potentials were monitored throughout the experiment and microarray analysis was carried out on transcripts obtained at 10 and 17 days following application of stress and after recovery irrigation. The two tolerant genotypes show more drastic changes in global gene expression which correlate with different physiological mechanisms of adaptation to drought. Differences in the kinetics and number of up- and down-regulated genes were observed between the tolerant and susceptible maize genotypes, as well as differences between the two tolerant genotypes. Interestingly, the most dramatic differences between the tolerant and susceptible genotypes were observed during recovery irrigation, suggesting that the tolerant genotypes activate mechanisms that allow more efficient recovery after a severe drought. Conclusions/Significance A correlation between levels of photosynthesis and transcription under stress was observed and differences in the number, type and expression levels of transcription factor families were also identified under drought and recovery between the three maize landraces. Gene expression analysis suggests that the drought tolerant landraces have a greater capacity to rapidly modulate more genes under drought and recovery in comparison to the susceptible landrace. Modulation of a greater number of differentially expressed genes of different TF gene families is an important characteristic of the tolerant genotypes. Finally, important differences were also noted between the tolerant landraces that underlie different mechanisms of achieving tolerance.","October 30, 2009","2015-05-20 22:25:22","2015-05-20 22:25:22","2015-05-20 22:25:22","e7531","","10","4","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/GCJIVCQA/Hayano-Kanashiro et al. - 2009 - Analysis of Gene Expression and Physiological Resp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nutrient restoration is now technically feasible because its mechanisms are understood and the rural development community is alerted to this need. Rapid and inexpensive approaches of diagnosing soil fertility limitations are also becoming available and information generated is becoming systematically applied. For example, the recently initiated Africa Soil Information Service project aims at evaluating, mapping, and monitoring Africa's soil qualities for better targeting of soil fertility management technologies to improve crop yields while enhancing the environment. Practical knowledge is available on nutrient management in small-scale farming systems that combines increased biological nitrogen fixation, utilizes agromineral resources such as phosphate rock, better uses organic resources, and more efficiently applies mineral fertilizers. The new approach to managing soil nutrients, recognized as integrated soil fertility management, aims to increase food production through strategic combination of traditional and new technologies and is being stimulated through increased availability and more profitable use of mineral fertilizers by Africa's poorer farmers. This is building on already existing sparks of hope for restoring soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa derived from such examples as the increasing adoption of the zaï-type of pitting system originated in drier parts of West Africa which exemplifies the beneficial effects of integrating harvesting of water and applying nutrient sources at each planting station so as to increase yield in a region where both necessities are key limiting factors. Nitrogen fixation by indigenous and introduced legumes combined with improved agronomic practices has shown potential for kick-starting self-multiplying improvements in soil productivity. Such successes will be accelerated by broader initiatives which improve rural infrastructure, increase accessibility of inputs, improve marketing facilities, and make reinvestment into farming more productive and sustainable. Indeed, experience indicates that investments in farming and, by inference, soil fertility conservation are made when economic returns from smallholder production are sufficient to do so. So, while technical advances leading to improvements in farming practice must continue, policymakers must also recognize that agriculture ultimately forms the basis for economic recovery and act upon past promises to invest in agriculture, including the restoration of nutrient-depleted soils. Investments must address factors that have impacts both on the broad reforms for provision of services such as marketing and trade, as well as those directly constraining the poor farmers such as capacity to access and efficiently apply fertilizers.","2010","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","183-236","","","Volume 108","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","Donald L.

Lactation performance and nutrient intake responses caused by forage type (red clover vs. alfalfa), maturity (early vs. late), and equivalent acid detergent fiber (ADF) content (yr 1, late alfalfa vs. late red clover; yr 2, early alfalfa vs. late red clover) were compared. Milk yield was not different between cows fed red clover or alfalfa in yr 1, but milk yield was higher for cows fed red clover in yr 2. When cows were fed alfalfa and red clover with similar ADF content, the milk yield of cows fed red clover was lower than that of cows fed alfalfa in yr 1, and milk yields were similar between cows fed alfalfa and red clover in yr 2. Milk protein yield and percentage were lower for cows fed red clover in yr 1 and 2, respectively. Intake of ADF and neutral detergent fiber was lower for cows fed red clover in both years. When red clover contained the same ADF content as did alfalfa, cows fed red clover ate less ADF, neutral detergent fiber, and dry matter, resulting in lower milk yield potential.","December 1997","2014-09-21 02:41:59","2014-09-21 02:41:59","","3308-3315","","12","80","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","alfalfa; lactation; red clover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is leading to a shift in the way food is produced. In particular the animal industry is increasing the number of organic and naturally finished meat animals rather than finishing them on grains. The objective of this study was to determine if different pasture compositions (i.e. grass only or grass legume mixtures) would impact the fatty acid (FA) meat composition of beef steers (Bos taurus L.). The pasture treatments were tall fescue [Lollium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbysh] only, or tall fescue combined with either red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. ssp. sativa L.). Beef steers (n = 9–10 per treatment) rotationally grazed each pasture treatment. Forage from treatments were different for crude protein (CP), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and the FA myristric (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and total FA. Steers grazing mixtures with either red clover (RC) or alfalfa (ALF) had greater average daily gains (ADG) than tall fescue only. Additionally, RC treatment steers had larger ribeye areas (REA) and greater finishing weights than those in the ALF treatment. However, the differences found between pasture treatments in FA concentration did not translate to any differences in the FA concentration of meat harvested from steers. Thus, it is concluded that although the pastures contained different FA concentrations, with the levels of legumes present, this does not influence the FA composition of beef.","August 2010","2014-09-21 02:41:20","2014-09-21 02:41:20","","597-605","","4","85","","Meat Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Beef; Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA); Fatty acids; Forage; Omega-3; Pasture; Steers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, the biological and physical characteristics of California’s rocky reef kelp forests are concurrently monitored by two such groups, using similar methodologies—underwater visual census (UVC) of fish, benthic invertebrates, and reef habitat, though the volunteer group limits their sampling to transects close to the reef surface and they use a more constrained list of species for enumeration and measurement. Here, we compared the data collected from 13 reefs that were sampled by both programs in 2008. These groups described relatively similar fish communities, total fish abundance and abundance of the dominant fish species but there were some differences in the measured size distributions of the dominant fish species. Descriptions of the benthic invertebrate community were also similar, though there were some differences in relative abundance that may have resulted from the less detailed subsampling protocols used by the volunteers. The biggest difference was in characterization of the physical habitat of the reefs, which appeared to result from selection bias of transect path by the volunteer program towards more complex structured sections of a reef. Changes to address these differences are relatively simple to implement and if so, offer the promise of better integration of the trained volunteer monitoring with that of professional monitoring groups.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:44:58","2012-12-20","3239-3257","","5","184","","Environ Monit Assess","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/CHUUUG3G/gillett_comparing_2012.pdf","","","Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution68; Citizen-based monitoring; Ecology64; Ecotoxicology65; Environmental Management67; Environmental Monitoring/Analysis66; Reef Check California; Rocky reef; Underwater visual census","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis combines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze the ‘EPS-HLS interface’ is based on term map visualizations of HLS research fields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the basis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by identifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a large-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all fields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each representing a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used to identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each other. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the limitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An important advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative insights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand, yields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research contributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new materials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular synthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces; medical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal processing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and statistical methods for data analysis.

This study presents actions taken in a citizen science program to assure data quality and demonstrates the validity of citizen-generated data. In this case the accuracy of data collected by secondary school students as citizens in a program that quantitatively sampled benthic rocky intertidal communities at 13 sites on Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and Hawai‘i island during the years 2004–2007 was evaluated. In 2007, two independent research teams collected data simultaneously with students at five sites on eight sampling dates. Comparisons of Shannon diversity and Bray-Curtis similarity values computed and simulated from student and researcher collected data revealed that nonexpert students accurately collect community-level data within the range of the variation that occurs between researchers. Students were, however, likely to misidentify cryptic and rare species. These findings have direct implications for the conservation goals of the monitoring program as the assessment reveals that students are likely to misidentify early alien introductions but are able to monitor the abundances of native and introduced species once they become established. The validity assessment designed for this investigation is unique in that it directly compares consistent errors made by citizens in data collection to expert variability to identify usage limitations and can be a guide for future studies that involve the efforts of trained volunteers.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:08","2012-12-20","1201-1212","","4","22","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/7CNK8HF4/cox_expert_2012.pdf","","","citizen scientists83; community structure84; data quality85; diversity86; ecological indices87; education88; Hawaii, USA89; intertidal monitoring90; trained volunteers91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To optimize conservation impact within a biogeographical region, quantitative knowledge is needed of the species present, which should be prioritized, and the management interventions these require. The next challenge is to avoid a proliferation of competing species plans, or conversely, a lack of detail within generic habitat-based approaches. * We present a methodology for biodiversity auditing. We quantified regional biodiversity by systematically collating available species records, allowing objective prioritization. We collated autecological information to integrate multiple species into management guilds with shared requirements, providing evidence-based guidance for regional conservation. * For two regions of Eastern England, Breckland (2300 km2) and The Broads (2000 km2), we collated 0·83 and 1·5-million records, respectively. Numbers of species (12 845 and 11 067) and priority species (rare, threatened, designated or regionally restricted: 2097 and 1519, respectively) were orders of magnitude greater than previously recognized. Regional specialists, with a UK range largely or entirely restricted to the region, were poorly recognized posing a risk of regional homogenization. * A large body of autecological information existed for priority species and collating this allowed us to define cross-taxa management guilds. Numbers of priority species requiring different combinations of ecological processes and conditions were not matched by current conservation practice in Breckland. For example, the current agri-environment agreements for designated grass heaths potentially catered for only 15% of the 542 priority species and 21% of 47 regional specialists that could potentially benefit from evidence-based management. A focus on vegetation composition rather than the ecological requirements of priority species underpinned this failure. * Synthesis and applications. The biodiversity audit approach provides an objective model for prioritization and cost-effective conservation, applicable to regions of Europe where biodiversity has been well characterized.

In Latin America, coffee is traditionally produced under a diverse and dense canopy of shade trees. The structural and floristic diversity contained therein harbors a high biodiversity of associated organisms. The recent trend of reducing this shade cover so as to increase production raises concerns about the potential loss of biodiversity. This concern has given rise to a variety of conservation programs, including shade coffee certification, a market-based conservation strategy. Shade coffee certification programs offer the opportunity to link environmental and economic goals. Although the idea of shade certification is to compensate farmers for the biodiversity conservation service provided by their shaded plantations, the premium offered may not compensate for the low yields of the most shaded plantations. Here we present an approach for guiding the establishment of premium prices for coffee producers based on scientific information that relates shade percentage and levels of species richness with yield. Partial data from two separate studies in Chiapas, Mexico, are combined and used to illustrate this approach. In addition, further theoretical explorations are made by adapting an intercropping model and using coffee yield and biodiversity (as it relates to percent of shade of canopy trees) as the two relevant variables. This model is examined qualitatively from the point of view of optimality (balancing biodiversity preservation with production). Results suggest that price premium for shade certification should be high and go directly to the producers, especially if the intent is to conserve forest-sensitive species.","September 15, 2005","2015-02-11 15:44:05","2015-02-11 15:44:05","2015-02-11 15:44:05","435-446","","4","54","","Ecological Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/HV2SQJ7T/perfecto_biodiversity_2005.pdf","","","agroforestry; BIODIVERSITY; coffee certification programs; yield set","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 1978/79 Marine Ecosystems Analysis (MESA) Puget Sound Project provided baseline data for wintering marine bird abundance for the southern Strait of Georgia and northern Puget Sound. Subsequently, comprehensive census work has been limited to aerial surveys (1990­present) by the Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program (PSAMP), shore-based and ferry surveys by Western Washington University (WWU) of marine bird abundance (2003­present), and Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs, 1960s­present). I use these three surveys to evaluate changes in non-breeding-season marine bird abundance in the Salish Sea. Comparison of WWU data from 2003 to 2005 with 1970s MESA data from the same locations shows significant declines in 14 of the 37 most common overwintering Salish Sea species, including 10 species that declined by more than 50%; seven species showed significant increases over that time period. The order of species, from those showing the most declines to those showing the greatest increases, showed a significant correlation between the PSAMP and WWU studies. Western Grebe Aechmophorus occidentalis, scaup (primarily Greater Scaup Aythya marila), and Marbled Murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus showed significant declines in all three studies. The Common Murre Uria aalge, not included in the PSAMP study, showed significant declines of more than 80% in the WWU and CBC studies. Significant declines occurred in species of four of the five feeding guilds, including piscivores, benthivores, omnivores and planktivores, and significant increases were seen in species of three feeding guilds, demonstrating that the factors affecting species abundance are complex and may be unique to each species. The WWU study largely corroborates declines documented by the PSAMP study, and analysis of 11 Salish Sea CBCs found the fewest species with significant declines. Long-term monitoring, including continuation and expansion of low-cost monitoring such as the WWU survey, and citizen-science efforts such as the BC Coastal Waterbird Survey (1999­present) and the Seattle Audubon Society's new Puget Sound Seabird Survey, will help to determine how future environmental changes in the Salish Sea marine ecosystem and beyond affect migratory and resident marine bird populations.","2009","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","9–17","","","37","","","Changes in marine bird abundance in the Salish Sea","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/J7P3KEEA/bower_changes_2009.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since breeding of new industrial crops targeted for arid lands is not appreciably different from that of traditional crops, higher yield is achieved by increased harvest-index, at the cost of losing traits associated with drought-tolerance and reduced seed-yield stability. Using Lesquerella as a model we compared selected and unselected accessions of annual (L. gracilis and L. angustifolia) and perennial (L. pinetorum and L. mendocina) genotypes grown in field experiments in Patagonia, Argentina. Our objective was to assess the effects of breeding for increased seed-yield on traits related to the main characteristics that define the most common ideotype for mediterranean-type environments: early vigor, conservative growth strategy post-anthesis and reserves storage. Our specific question was: Have any of the attributes associated with seed-yield stability been indirectly selected during the domestication process? Our results show that these characteristics were reduced or lost, in selected lines compared to their wild relatives. Early vigor was lower in selected accessions and was associated mainly with reduced relative growth rate and CO2 assimilation. During the reproductive period the growth strategy was changed by selection towards a non-conservative and more acquisitive resource use strategy. Traits associated with this strategy were linked to higher water use efficiency and growth capacity (higher CO2 assimilation rate, specific leaf area, and leaf allocation), but also with loss of structural adaptation to low resource environments (i.e. low specific leaf area), an increase in nutrient and water demands, and reduced nutrient use efficiency. Carbohydrates accumulation pre-anthesis was lower in selected accessions of all four species, and also, just in perennials we found lower reserves storage post-anthesis. These changes in the pattern of carbohydrates accumulation could be associated to lower seed-yield stability due to the loss of buffer capacity linked with the use of pre-anthesis reserves for seed filling. On the other hand, in perennial species lower reserves storage after seed harvest could reduce plant longevity and survival. We conclude that indirect changes occurred during the preliminary domestication of both annual and perennial species of Lesquerella used in our experiment. These changes were against those required if these species were to be developed as crops for semi-arid, mediterranean environments and should result in low seed-yield stability.","September 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:25","2014-09-21 02:40:25","","1372-1380","","2","34","","Industrial Crops and Products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbohydrates; Mediterranean-type environments; New crops; Specific leaf area; Water use efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relations–for instance, based on bibliographic coupling.","2012","2015-02-12 19:26:09","2015-02-12 19:26:09","2015-02-12 19:26:09","2378-2392","","12","63","","J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec","","","","","","","","en","© 2012 ASIS&T","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/VZFRJV7X/waltman-new-2012.pdf","","Bibliographic network mapping","bibliometrics; citation analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maximum values of relative growth rate (RGR) (0.17 g g−1 day−1), net assimilation rate (NAR) (85 g m−2 week−1) and leaf area ratio (LAR) (1.6 dm2 g−1) were achieved by 25 days from planting at the lower densities. Maximum NAR and RGR at 1 × 106 density was delayed until day 36. By day 45 this density had almost complete light interception, and all densities had complete interception by day 85. This variety had a low extinction coefficient (0.3) suggesting that canopy structure was efficient in allowing light penetration. Since crop growth rate and leaf area index (LAI) were linearly related, highest dry matter yields were at the highest density. Highest seed yield per hectare (1300 kg) was at the 5 × 105 density, but overall, yields were not significantly different. Pod number per plant was the main determinant of yield. From the relationship of pod number per plant and density, an optimum density of 7.5 × 105 plants ha−1 was predicted. It was concluded on the basis of growth and leaf area data that this new material could support a higher photosynthetic demand if the objectives of a breeding program to increase seed size and/or seeds per pod could be achieved.","1981","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","201-213","","","4","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model was originally developed using citizen reports of coyote sightings to predict the probability of a human-coyote interaction based on proximity to habitat features. Because the data were obtained from surveys, researchers could not separate patterns of site occupancy by coyotes from possible patterns of detection by respondents.  Nevertheless, the model could be an indicator of site occupancy within the suburban matrix.  We sought to evaluate the predictive power of the human-coyote interaction model with data gathered via a more rigorous method.  To build a set of validation sites, we surveyed 11 parks in Westchester County and one park in Bronx County, NY with camera traps between April and October of 2010.  The probability of photographing a coyote in a single trap-night was 0.06 ± 0.12 and all sites had >0.9 probability of detecting a coyote at least once given the total trap-nights at each site.  During validation, we also added four additional sites that had been surveyed by other researchers with camera traps as additional “present” sites.  Predictions of coyote presence or absence based on the human-coyote interaction model for these 16 validation sites were compared to the observed survey results.  The model, which contained distances to forest, grassland, and pooled medium and high development performed well in predicting the observed data (kappa = 0.75 ± 0.17, Area-Under-Curve of Receiver-Operator-Characteristic plots = 0.90).  The model appears to sufficiently predict coyote occupancy in a suburban-urban landscape and will form the basis of for development of a more comprehensive model of coyote distribution in the New York City metropolitan area.  Furthermore, its accuracy illustrates how citizen science can provide reliable estimates of wildlife-habitat patterns in urban areas.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:22","2012-12-20","23-35-35","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","Nagy under Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Portugal License:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/pt/deed.en_US","","","","socpvs.org","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ERFIJKGF/nagy_validation_2012.pdf","","","Canis latrans; human-wildlife interaction; model validation; suburban; urban; wildlife management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The result of the Logistic Regression analysis performed to find out the factors that determine the adoption of OVF, found significant influence of several factors including women’s leading role in OVF, motivation by GOs and NGOs, motivation by community members and farmers’ groups, attendance in training, satisfaction with the price of organic vegetables, and the intensity of pest hazard. Moreover, the Linear Regression analysis carried out to explore the determinants of the extent of OVF at farm household level revealed three significantly influencing factors, namely: the amount of organic fertilizers such as farm yard manure and compost produced by farmers themselves, perception of the harmful effect of inorganic pesticides and the length of experience in growing vegetables.

Pearl millet has a number of advantages that include tolerance to drought, heat, and leached acid sandy soils with very low clay and organic matter content. Its grain is generally superior to sorghum as human food and at least equals maize in value as a feed grain. Whereas, grain is the main purpose of cultivation in Africa and Asia, the forage, or stover, at harvest is an important secondary product in subsistence agriculture for animal feed, fuel, or construction. Two principal types of food are traditionally made from pearl millet porridges and flat unleavened breads. Both of these are made from flour, however, because pearl millet flour deteriorates after a few days and acquires a “mousy” odor, fresh flour must be grounded frequently. Other products include rice-like foods made from pearled grain, couscous, foods from blends with legume flour, and beer. Pearl millet gives a productive pasture for grazing, especially with dwarf varieties, and silage is easily made. Pearl millet is used as a forage crop in the United States, Australia, and southern Africa, but the hybrid with elephant grass (napier grass), P. purpureum Schum., is widely used as a perennial forage crop in east and southern Africa, Brazil, and India where it is principally propagated by cuttings.","1992","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","89-139","","","Volume 48","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","Donald L.

More than 6000 seeds from four different populations collected during two years of study were screened for ploidy using a flow cytometer. In parallel, the frequency both of plants with large pollen (LP) and of LP production on these plants was quantified in two populations. No tetraploid seeds were detected, although in each population a few triploid seeds were regularly produced at a frequency of two triploid seeds per thousand. The frequency of LP producers was similar in the four populations, as was the frequency of LP production. The frequency of LP was ten times that of triploid seeds.

While the utility of a once-a-year census as a monitoring tool is potentially compromised by lack of standardization in counting protocols and variation in observer skill, at Willow Slough these issues have been minimized. We examined the Willow Slough count data for trends in both faunal diversity and the probability of presence of individual species. During the study, the number of species observed at a visit declined by 39%. Regressions of per-visit species counts against time did not detect a statistically significant decline until year 24. In contrast, Fisher’s α, a statistic designed to reduce sample-size bias, detected the decline as early as year 13. Twelve of the 24 species analyzed showed significant declines in probability of occurrence; a further nine exhibited negative but non-significant trends. Butterflies that overwinter as eggs or larvae were more likely to decline than those that overwinter as pupae or adults. Many species in decline at Willow Slough have also been observed less frequently at nearby sites which are monitored year-round, supporting the value of once-a-year monitoring. Although correlations with climatic data have been identified, they are too weak to account for the observed faunal decline. We suspect broader patterns of land use and habitat continuity are implicated in butterfly declines across the region. We conclude that once-a-year sampling, if properly and rigorously done, is in fact useful as a monitoring tool for butterfly faunas, and that Fisher’s α is well suited to early detection of trends in repeated diversity sampling.","2011-07","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","2012-2019","","7","144","","Biological Conservation","Once-yearly sampling for the detection of trends in biodiversity","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/TNHGB6B3/obrien_once-yearly_2011.pdf","","","Butterfly; Citizen-science; Diversity; Fisher’s alpha; Life history; Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such variability in data quality may result in biased predictions obtained from species distribution models (SDMs). We aimed to identify the limitations of different monitoring data sources for developing species distribution maps and to evaluate their potential for spatial data integration in a conservation context. Using Maxent, SDMs were generated from three different bird data sources in Catalonia, which differ in the degree of standardisation and available sample size. In addition, an alternative approach for modelling species distributions was applied, which combined the three data sources at a large spatial scale, but then downscaling to the required resolution. Finally, SDM predictions were used to identify species richness and high quality areas (hotspots) from different treatments. Models were evaluated by using high quality Atlas information. We show that both sample size and survey methodology used to collect the data are important in delivering robust information on species distributions. Models based on standardized monitoring provided higher accuracy with a lower sample size, especially when modelling common species. Accuracy of models from opportunistic observations substantially increased when modelling uncommon species, giving similar accuracy to a more standardized survey. Although downscaling data through a SDM approach appears to be a useful tool in cases of data shortage or low data quality and heterogeneity, it will tend to overestimate species distributions. In order to identify distributions of species, data with different quality may be appropriate. However, to identify biodiversity hotspots high quality information is needed.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:43:48","2012-12-20","2927-2948","","11","21","","Biodivers Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/PQ62EUV2/sarda-palomera_mapping_2012.pdf","","","Citizen science; Evolutionary Biology86; Farmland Birds; Maxent; Occurrence data bias; Plant Sciences88; Species distribution models; Tree Biology87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the advent of technology, Web 2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring. However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses. Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a hypothetico-deductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the literature from social geography on the concept of ""citizen sensors"" and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when applying information from citizen sensors to research and management questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI.

In this study, we compare the abilities of volunteer and experienced individuals to detect low-density populations of an actively spreading invasive species, and we explore how interobserver variation can bias estimates of the proportion of sites infested derived from occupancy models that allow for both false negative and false positive (misclassification) errors. We found that experienced individuals detected small infestations at sites where volunteers failed to find infestations. However, occupancy models erroneously suggested that experienced observers had a higher probability of falsely detecting the species as present than did volunteers. This unexpected finding is an artifact of the modeling framework and results from a failure of volunteers to detect low-density infestations rather than from false positive errors by experienced observers.

Cuban peasants have been able to boost food production without scarce and expensive imported agricultural chemicals by first substituting more ecological inputs for the no longer available imports, and then by making a transition to more agroecologically integrated and diverse farming systems. This was possible not so much because appropriate alternatives were made available, but rather because of the Campesino-a-Campesino (CAC) social process methodology that the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) used to build a grassroots agroecology movement. This paper was produced in a ‘self-study’ process spearheaded by ANAP and La Via Campesina, the international agrarian movement of which ANAP is a member. In it we document and analyze the history of the Campesino-to-Campesino Agroecology Movement (MACAC), and the significantly increased contribution of peasants to national food production in Cuba that was brought about, at least in part, due to this movement. Our key findings are (i) the spread of agroecology was rapid and successful largely due to the social process methodology and social movement dynamics, (ii) farming practices evolved over time and contributed to significantly increased relative and absolute production by the peasant sector, and (iii) those practices resulted in additional benefits including resilience to climate change.","January 1, 2011","2015-04-06 18:34:52","2015-04-06 18:34:52","2015-04-06 18:34:52","161-191","","1","38","","","The Campesino-to-Campesino agroecology movement of ANAP in Cuba","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","PMID: 21284238","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/CR48HGAJ/rosset_campesino_2011.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is much interest in using saline groundwater to grow marine fish on salt-affected farmland, the disposal of nutrient enriched, saline aquaculture effluent is a major environmental problem. We investigated the potential of the salt-tolerant NyPa Forage plant (Distichlis spicata L. Greene var. yensen-4a) to trap nutrients from saline aquaculture effluent and subsequently to provide a fodder crop for livestock. Sub-surface flow wetlands containing NyPa Forage were constructed and their efficacy in removing total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite/nitrate, total phosphorus and orthophosphate was monitored under different levels of nutrients and salinity. The wetlands removed 60–90% of total nitrogen loads and at least 85% of ammonia, nitrite/nitrate, total phosphorus and orthophosphate loads, with greater efficiency at high nutrient and low salinity levels. The above-ground yield, sodium, crude protein (CP) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) of NyPa Forage plants were measured after fertilisation with different nutrient levels and cropping at different frequencies. Yield of plants increased with increased nutrient, while nutritive value was greater when nutrients were applied but did not differ among nutrient levels. Yield was not affected by cropping frequency, but nutritive value was greatest when plants were cropped at intervals of 21 or 42 days. At optimum nutrient addition and cropping levels, the plants had a mean CP content of 16.7% and an in vitro DMD of 67.6%, equivalent to an energy value of 9.5 MJ kg− 1. Assuming an equivalent fibre content and voluntary food intake as grass hay, and no accumulation of other toxic minerals, these nutritive values would be sufficient for maintenance or moderate liveweight gains in dry adult sheep or cattle.","February 15, 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:51","2014-09-21 02:40:51","","192-201","","0","445–446","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agri-aquaculture; Constructed wetlands; Effluent; Inland saline aquaculture; Salinity; Saltland pasture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If observer variability can be quantified and is addressed, data collected by participants with wide ranges of experience and training can yield more reliable inferences. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a mammalian sentinel of climate change that has received consideration for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. As a result, numerous pika monitoring initiatives have been started throughout the mountains in western North America. Some initiatives employ research teams of biological science technicians (professionals), whereas many rely on networks of citizen scientists, or volunteers, for data collection. To date, few studies have quantified observer variability during pika surveys; none have explored the reliability of professional crews or volunteers. We conducted pika surveys in Glacier National Park, Montana, to quantify observer variability. We investigated observer variability 1) among a crew of professionals, 2) among volunteers, and 3) between professionals and volunteers. Professionals were more consistent at identifying pika signs and estimating potential home ranges and consistently found more pika signs than did the volunteers, with the exception of pika sightings. Estimates of pika occupancy were consistent at each site among volunteers conducting sitting surveys. We suggest that sitting surveys conducted by volunteers can reliably detect pika site occupancy. However, data on population dynamics of pikas (e.g., density) should be collected by professionals.

Procuring beneficial knowledge about nature, however, required observers, collectors, and compilers who could produce usable and useful descriptions of nature. The ways governments promoted scientific explorations varied according to the form of government, the makeup of the civil society, the state's economic ideologies and practices, and the geographical situation. This article argues that the roots of a major natural history initiative in Denmark-Norway were firmly planted in the state-church organization. Through the clergymen and their activities, a bishop, supported by the government in Copenhagen, could gather an impressive collection of natural objects, receive observations and descriptions of natural phenomena, and produce natural historical publications that described for the first time many of the species of the north. Devout naturalists were a common species in the eighteenth century, when clergymen and missionaries involved themselves in the investigation of nature in Europe and far beyond.

It draws on the reflections of professional actors operating across the UK environmental risk domain, focusing down on practice in the area of radioactive waste between 1998 and 2003. Compared with past science‐centred approaches, analysis shows an ‘opening up’ of risk decision processes to extended actors, knowledges, and values, with particular importance placed on public involvement in front‐end framing. This is being constrained by a failure to integrate engagement throughout decision processes, the exclusion of publics from assessing/evaluating environmental risks, and the upholding of a strict separation between citizens/science.

The discipline's failure to meaningfully connect these small studies with natural history's goal has made it hard to demonstrate the value of natural history to a wider scientific community. Digital technologies provide the means to bridge this gap. Results We describe the system architecture and template design of ""Scratchpads"", a data-publishing framework for groups of people to create their own social networks supporting natural history science. Scratchpads cater to the particular needs of individual research communities through a common database and system architecture. This is flexible and scalable enough to support multiple networks, each with its own choice of features, visual design, and constituent data. Our data model supports web services on standardised data elements that might be used by related initiatives such as GBIF and the Encyclopedia of Life. A Scratchpad allows users to organise data around user-defined or imported ontologies, including biological classifications. Automated semantic annotation and indexing is applied to all content, allowing users to navigate intuitively and curate diverse biological data, including content drawn from third party resources. A system of archiving citable pages allows stable referencing with unique identifiers and provides credit to contributors through normal citation processes. Conclusion Our framework http://scratchpads.eu/22 currently serves more than 1,100 registered users across 100 sites, spanning academic, amateur and citizen-science audiences. These users have generated more than 130,000 nodes of content in the first two years of use.

Todate, genetic transformation has been reported in all the major pulse crops like Vigna species, Cicer arietinum, Cajanus cajan, Phaseolus spp, Lupinus spp, Vicia spp and Pisum sativum, but transgenic pulse crops have not yet been commercially released. Despite the crucial role played by pulse crops in tropical agriculture, transgenic pulse crops have not moved out from laboratories to large farm lands compared to their counterparts – ‘cereals’ and the closely related leguminous oil crop – ‘soybean’. The reason for lack of commercialization of transgenic pulse crops can be attributed to the difficulty in developing transgenics with reproducibility, which in turn is due to lack of competent totipotent cells for transformation, long periods required for developing transgenics and lack of coordinated research efforts by the scientific community and long term funding. With optimization of various factors which influence genetic transformation of pulse crops, it will be possible to develop transgenic plants in this important group of crop species with more precision and reproducibility. A translation of knowledge from information available in genomics and functional genomics in model legumes like Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus relating to factors which contribute to enhancing crop yield and ameliorate the negative consequences of biotic and abiotic stress factors may provide novel insights for genetic manipulation to improve the productivity of pulse crops.","March 2008","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","162-168","","2","26","","Biotechnology Advances","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Commercialization; Genetically modified crops; Transgenic pulse crops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a healthy river, physical process and form remain actively connected and able to mutually adjust, and biological communities have natural levels of diversity and are resilient to environmental stress. Both physical diversity and biodiversity influence river health. Physical diversity is governed by hydrology, hydraulics, and substrate, as reflected in the geometry of the river channel and adjacent floodplain, which create habitat for aquatic and riparian organisms. Biodiversity is governed by biological processes such as competition and predation, but biodiversity also reflects the diversity, abundance and stability of habitat, as well as connectivity. Connectivity within a river corridor includes longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions. River health declines as any of these interacting components is compromised by human activities. The cumulative effect of dams and other human alterations of rivers has been primarily to directly reduce physical diversity and connectivity, which indirectly reduces biodiversity. Restoration and maintenance of physical diversity and biodiversity on rivers affected by dams requires quantifying relations between the driver variables of flow and sediment supply, and the response variables of habitat, connectivity, and biological communities. These relations can take the form of thresholds (e.g., entrainment of streambed sediment) or response curves (e.g., fish biomass versus extent and duration of floodplain inundation). I use examples from Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona in the western United States to illustrate how to quantify relations between driver and response variables on rivers affected by dams.","September 2012","2014-09-21 02:41:37","2014-09-21 02:41:37","","271-287","","3","27","","International Journal of Sediment Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dams; River health; River restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essentials for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature’s ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans can now build an agriculture based on nature’s ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture.","February 2002","2014-09-21 02:40:28","2014-09-21 02:40:28","","111-117","","2","88","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture; Nature; Polyculture; Sustainable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concerns about the reliance of past agricultural intensification on non-renewable resources, about its negative impacts on natural resources both on and off farm and on greenhouse gas emissions, provide an imperative for future agricultural intensification to become ecologically efficient. We define ecological intensification of agriculture (EIA) as: producing more food per unit resource use while minimising the impact of food production on the environment. Achieving it will require increased precision in the use of inputs and reduction in inefficiencies and losses. It will also require a more holistic view of farming, going beyond efficiencies of single inputs into a single field in a single season to consideration of efficiencies of whole systems over decades. This paper explores the ecological intensification issues facing agricultural production in Australia where opportunities for agricultural intensification are centred on more efficient use of limited and unreliable water resources in both dryland and irrigated agriculture. Ecological efficiencies can be achieved by better matching the supply of nutrients to crops’ requirements both temporally and spatially. This has the added benefit of minimising the opportunities for excessive nutrients to impact on soil health (acidity and dryland salinity) and water quality (pollution of groundwater and eutrophication of lakes and rivers). Opportunities for ecologically efficient intensification are also identified through better integration of crop and livestock enterprises on mixed crop–livestock farms. We define nine desirable attributes of an EIA system: (1) increased agricultural production; (2) efficient use of limited resources; (3) minimal impact on global warming; (4) minimal negative on-site impacts; (5) minimal negative off-site impacts; (6) minimal risk and maximum resilience; (7) preservation of biodiversity in agriculture; (8) preservation of biodiversity in nature and; (9) positive social outcomes. We focus on four technologies and production systems emerging in Australian agriculture: climate risk management; precision agriculture; crop–livestock integration and deficit irrigation. For each of these systems we identify how well they are likely to match the nine desirable attributes of an EIA system. While it seems unlikely that any single technology can satisfy all nine desirable attributes, there is hope that in combination emerging and future technologies will progress Australian agriculture towards greater productivity and ecological efficiency.","January 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:56","2014-09-21 02:40:56","","109-123","","0","44","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate risk management; Crop–livestock integration; Deficit irrigation; Nutrient use efficiency; Precision agriculture; Water use efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, exposure of crop plants to CYN by irrigation with contaminated water has already been shown. Therefore, in this study, horticulturally important and highly consumed Brassica species were investigated to determine the level of CYN in the leaves after exposure of the roots to the toxin. Treatment of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, Brassica juncea, and Sinapis alba under varying experimental conditions showed significant CYN uptake, with CYN levels ranging from 10% to 21% in the leaves compared to the CYN concentration applied to the roots (18–35 μg/l).

In this article, I trace the roots of agroecology to its emergence as Agroecología in Mexico in the 1970s as a form of resistance to the Green Revolution. Agroecology has become much more than a science for developing better, safer, and more environmentally sound food production technologies. Agroecology is more than a way to practice agriculture, such as organic or ecological production. Agroecology is also a social movement with a strong ecological grounding that fosters justice, relationship, access, resilience, resistance, and sustainability.

Biomass investment in roots and other vegetative organs, flowering rates between plants and within the plant, and gas exchange parameters were measured in L. fendleri and L. mendocina in both well-watered and water-stressed plants during flowering.

This paper describes patterns of biomass allocation, morphological traits related to stress-tolerance and seed-yield in four species of Oenothera grown in a common garden at three plant densities. Wild and domesticated species are compared. The effect of resource availability on those traits during three phenological stages (vegetative, reproductive and maturity) is described. Native species were characterized by traits related to stress-tolerance (high root allocation and low specific leaf area) during the vegetative stage. This suite of traits resulted in low biomass accumulation and low seed-yield. The domesticated O. biennis was characterized by a combination of traits related to stress-tolerance (low specific leaf area) and high productivity (high leaf allocation and leaf area ratio and low root allocation). Domesticated species accumulated more biomass than natives. Total biomass and total non-structural carbohydrates present in roots were positively correlated to seed-yield. Oenothera biennis showed the highest seed-yield, although this species showed yield instability in response to changes in the environmental quality. No changes in seed-yield in response to plant density were recorded for either O. lamarckiana or native species. Oenothera biennis showed an optimum density of 20 plants m−2 and yielded 260 g m−2, a seed-yield similar to that reported in other countries. Low seed-yield of native species is major drawback that must be overcome. Improving seed-yield in these species could be possible by selection oriented to increase total biomass. Since no detrimental effect of density was found in O. lamarckiana and natives, a higher plant density might increase yield production per unit area.","September 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:59","2014-09-21 02:40:59","","1269-1276","","2","34","","Industrial Crops and Products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbohydrate storage; Plant density; Seed-oil crop; Specific leaf area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is well established that communities are composed of a few common and many rare species, and numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain this pattern. However, no attempt has been made to determine how well these theoretical characterizations capture observed taxonomic and global-scale spatial variation in the general form of the distribution. Here, using data of a scope unprecedented in community ecology, we show that a simple maximum entropy model produces a truncated log-series distribution that can predict between 83% and 93% of the observed variation in the rank abundance of species across 15 848 globally distributed communities including birds, mammals, plants, and butterflies. This model requires knowledge of only the species richness and total abundance of the community to predict the full abundance distribution, which suggests that these factors are sufficient to understand the distribution for most purposes. Since geographic patterns in richness and abundance can often be successfully modeled, this approach should allow the distribution of commonness and rarity to be characterized, even in locations where empirical data are unavailable.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:46:10","2012-12-20","1772-1778","","8","93","","Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/MHJVCPEX/white_characterizing_2012.pdf","","","birds79; butterflies80; citizen science81; commonness82; community structure83; informatics84; mammals85; maximum entropy86; rarity87; species abundance distribution88; trees89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Salicornia bigelovii is a leafless, C3, succulent annual salt marsh plant that produces an oilseed on seawater irrigation in coastal desert environments. Yields on seawater are similar to conventional oilseeds under ideal conditions but are reduced under mechanical harvest due to uneven seed ripening and shattering of seeds. Water management requires frequent irrigation to keep the shallow-root zone at field capacity and to ensure a leaching fraction to prevent accumulation of salts. Nutritional value of oil, seed meal and biomass are adequate to replace conventional animal feed ingredients in formulated diets, despite presence of saponins in the meal and high salt content of the biomass. A breeding program showed that this species is amendable to improvement using conventional breeding approaches. Atriplex lentiformis is a perennial C4 xerohalophyte shrub valued as a forage species in North American rangelands. Under cultivation it produces as much biomass and protein as alfalfa on salinities ranging from mildly saline (1.8 g L−1 TDS) to full seawater salinity (40 g L−1). Greenhouse trials show that salinity increases dry matter production and water use efficiency of A. lentiformis on drying soils, making it a good candidate for deficit irrigation for forage production. As with other Atriplex spp., its crop potential is currently limited by a tendency to become woody with successive cuts and with non-protein nitrogen and anti-nutritional compounds present in leaves. Distichlis palmeri is a perennial C4 saltgrass endemic to the delta of the Colorado River in the northern Gulf of California that produces a grain similar in size and nutrition composition to rice. It was a staple summer food source for the Cocopa people before upstream water diversions disrupted flood flows to the delta. It is productive on full-strength seawater and produces aerenchyma tissue allowing it to grow under flooded conditions similar to paddy rice. However, only limited experiments have been conducted with this plant, and therefore its ultimate agronomic potential is unknown. Despite initial pessimism about the production potential of halophytes, these examples show that euhalophytes can maintain high productivity of useful agricultural products up to a root-zone salinity of 70 g L−1 TDS, double the salinity of seawater.","August 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:08","2014-09-21 02:40:08","","110-121","","0","92","","Environmental and Experimental Botany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Atriplex; Deficit irrigation; Distichlis; Salicornia; Salinity tolerance; Seawater","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, in a context of current global environmental changes, new methods allowing long-term monitoring are increasingly required. Various methods have been used to map seafloors, primarily benthic macrofauna and sediment sampling along regular grids or transects, and remote sensing methods. These methods map very different things, do not have the same accuracy levels, and have different costs in time and money. Furthermore, such methods often require the competencies of highly skilled scientists and exclude non-specialists otherwise best placed to perform them. In this paper, we test a method based on Direct Field Observations (‘DFO method’), which can be used by non-specialists, and assess if it is sufficient for mapping and monitoring intertidal habitats. We further compare this method with other conventional ones. The results show that such a simple method is relatively rapid and inexpensive given the results obtained. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for highly fragmented intertidal landscapes where other methods are often very limited. In consequence, in areas such as the European coasts, it can be used by non-specialists, such as protected-area managers, and because it is an inexpensive and quick method long-term monitoring is also possible.","2009-06-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","378-402","","3","33","","Progress in Physical Geography","Mapping and monitoring intertidal benthic habitats","","","","","","","en","","","","","ppg.sagepub.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ATJRMV66/godet_mapping_2009.pdf","","review","benthic habitats25; Chausey archipelago26; citizen science27; direct field observation28; habitat mapping30; habitat monitoring31; intertidal sandflats29; macrofaunal sampling32; remote sensing.33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An in vitro experiment was designed to determine the optimum rate of inclusion of rolled barley to optimise rumen efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis (EBPS) of diets comprising a typical ryegrass silage (GR; crude protein (CP) = 139 g/kg dry matter (DM); water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) = 71 g/kg DM; NH3–N = 133 g/kg N; pH 4.23) or red clover silage (RC; CP = 168 g/kg DM; WSC = 28 g/kg DM; NH3–N = 80 g/kg N; pH 4.12). Both silages were mixed with increasing proportions of barley grain (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/kg DM). Treatments were tested using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC), replicated in three independent 10-day incubation periods (blocks). Artificial saliva was infused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, and on day 4 of incubation 15NH4SO4 was added as a microbial marker. Ammonia–N and pH of the effluent were above 50 mg/l and 6.6, respectively, in all treatments and at all time points measured. Inclusion of barley grain reduced the effluent concentrations of acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acids (P ≤ 0.06). Apparent digestibilities of DM (DMAD) and organic matter (OMAD) did not differ between RC or GR silages, but RC had lower (P &lt; 0.001) neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibilities than GR silage. The effluent concentrations of acetic, propionic, butyric and total volatile fatty acids from GR was higher (P &lt; 0.05) than from RC diets. Inclusion of barley grain linearly (P &lt; 0.06) reduced the effluent acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acid concentrations, but increased DMAD, OMAD and efficiency of bacterial dry matter synthesis (EBDMS). However, there was no clear response in EBPS from GR silage supplemented with barley, but in RC silage, EBPS increased up to a barley inclusion rate of 300 g/kg DM. It is concluded that rumen microorganisms reduced the amount of substrate fermented in correspondence with the increment in barley grain. The EBPS increased in RC silage by adding barley at rates of up to 300 g/kg DM. Conversely, the addition of barley to GR silage had no apparent effect on EBPS.","January 3, 2005","2014-09-21 02:42:07","2014-09-21 02:42:07","","79-91","","1–2","118","","Animal Feed Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbial protein synthesis; Red clover silage; RUSITEC; Ryegrass silage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amaranthus is recognized in Asia and Central and South America as a food crop that can be grown as a leafy vegetable or as a seed grain in mixed croppings.

Prosopis species (mesquite) leguminous trees occur worldwide in arid and semi-arid areas. As phreatophytes, they are resistant to drought and high temperature extremes and produce abundant yields of edible beanlike pods. Using the beans from the tree, a variety of attractive, marketable food products have been prepared. We have also identified intermediate wheat-grass, a perennial relative of wheat, as an ecologically and economically attractive alternate crop. It is already a well-established range crop; grown for seed, it becomes a useful grain intercrop. The wholegrain or endosperm mill fractions make excellent tasting, appetizing and attractive baked products. Ongoing agronomic studies indicate it is especially suitable for balancing ecologically unstable areas.","May 1992","2014-09-21 02:40:39","2014-09-21 02:40:39","","265-274","","1–4","40","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on constituent facies, bedset geometry, stacking pattern, and bounding surface characteristics, the entire succession can be classified into three architectural elements. Element I occurs along the basin margin and shows a monotonous stacking of tabular or crudely stratified conglomeratic units. It represents alluvial-fan deposits of debris-flow-dominated fan and sheetflood-dominated fan. Element II is characterized by multi-storey, sheet or upward-widening, conglomeratic channel-fills whose maximum thickness exceeds 1.5 m. Each channel-fill unit is encased within red–brown silty sandstones of Element III with sharp erosional bases but diffuse gradational upper boundaries. It consists generally of (1) cut-and-fill deposit (trough cross-stratified or openwork conglomerate) in the lower part and (2) composite low-relief bar deposit (lenticular conglomerate and stratified gravelly sandstone) in the upper part. Shallowness of each cut-and-fill unit, absence of fining-upward lateral accretion package and the predominance of simple-bar deposit collectively suggest deposition from ephemeral braided streams. Element III typically shows a fining-upward stacking of (1) single- or multi-storey small-scale (&lt;1.5 m thick) channel fills with limited lateral extent of less than 15 m, (2) poorly sorted, graded and diffusely bounded silty conglomerates or gravelly siltstones with discontinuous gravel sheets and pockets and (3) homogeneous or graded, red–brown fine-grained deposits with calcretes and burrows in ascending order. Element III is interpreted as channel-margin to floodplain, including crevasse channel fill, crevasse splay and floodplain fines. The entire sequence of the Sihwa Formation can be divided into the alluvial-fan and terminal-fan successions. The alluvial-fan succession displays a progradational stacking pattern and indicates a low rate of basin subsidence in the initial phase of rifting. The upper terminal-fan succession consists of proximal braided stream and distal floodplain deposits in the western and central parts of the basin and is characterized by an axial dispersal pattern and an aggradational stacking. It suggests rapid subsidence of the basin floor during the main phase of rifting. The asymmetrical cross-basin distribution of each architectural element reflects a half-graben structure of the basin with steep-gradient fault-bounded eastern margin (footwall block) and gently sloped, flexural western margin (hangingwall block). The predominance of ephemeral braided-stream deposits along with red–brown fine-grained floodplain deposits with common calcretes indicates arid to semi-arid palaeoclimates. Approximately 140 dinosaur eggs (Faveoloolithidae and Dendroolithidae) were identified mainly from the (gravelly) siltstones and small-scale channel fills of Element III deposits and partly from the cut-and-fill conglomerates of Element II deposits. The eggs commonly retain their original oval shape but are invariably breached and stuffed with the substrate of gravels and silt. They are either isolated or clustered, forming a circular concentration in plan view. The abundant yield of eggs, more than 20 eggs in 5 separate nests from a single depositional unit, suggests a dense population of the parental dinosaurs. The repetitive occurrence in many stratigraphic horizons reflects site preference as a nesting habitat of the near-channel or abandoned channel areas.","February 2009","2014-09-21 02:42:08","2014-09-21 02:42:08","","100-126","","1","30","","Cretaceous Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alluvial fan; Cretaceous; Depositional facies and architecture; Dinosaur egg and nest; Ephemeral braided stream; Sihwa Formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The persistence of species that range widely demands that they coexist with people both within and outside formally protected areas. It is often politically and financially infeasible for one central body, such as a government wildlife agency, to monitor an entire population. Therefore, conservation planners are increasingly turning to local knowledge to inform conservation decisions. Here, we show the scientific and conservation benefits of recruiting and training local community members to collect data on an endangered species, the Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi). We recruited 18 scouts from six community-held ranches in Samburu District, Kenya. The scouts record the location, group structure and habitat of all Grevy’s zebra herds seen in walking surveys. Kernel analyses of scout herd observations indicate areas heavily used by Grevy’s zebra, and the subset of these areas favored by females with young foals. The important areas identified by the scouts closely match those inferred from analyses of GPS radiocollar data. Further, scout data reveals extensive spatial and temporal overlap between livestock and Grevy’s zebra. This overlap suggests the potential for competition between Grevy’s zebra and domestic animals. We argue that scout programs such as ours can generate valuable insights for conservation planning. In addition, such programs have the potential to improve local attitudes toward wildlife conservation.","2009-07","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1548-1555","","7","142","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/S9KNTJU6/low_partnering_2009.pdf","","","Capacity building; Citizen science; Community monitoring; Grevy’s zebra; Kenya; Pastoralism; Samburu; Savannah ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ley farming systems with phases of shorter annual legume pasture phases with cereal crops predominate but, emerging sustainability issues and the need to manage risk is driving ongoing innovation in crop–livestock integration. We discuss the recent evolution of selected innovations that integrate crop and livestock production and their impacts on farm productivity, sustainability and business risk. Dual-purpose use of cereals and canola (Brassica napus) for forage during the vegetative stage while still harvesting for grain is now practiced throughout southern Australia's cropping zone. This practice provides risk management benefits, diversifies crop rotations, reduces pressure on other feed resources and can significantly increase both livestock and crop productivity from farms by 25–75% with little increase in inputs. Sacrificially grazing crops when expected grain yield is low and/or livestock prices are attractive relative to grain provides further flexibility in crop–livestock management systems vital for business risk management in a variable climate. Replacing annual pastures with perennial pasture phases in rotation with crops can provide a range of benefits including improved hydrological balance to reduce dryland salinity, subsoil acidification and water-logging, provide a management tool for herbicide-resistant or problem weeds, improved soil nutrient and carbon stocks as well as increased livestock productivity by filling feed gaps. In some environments, integration of perennial forages in mixtures with cropping, such as alley cropping and inter-cropping, also provide options for improving environmental outcomes. These practices are all innovations that provide flexibility and enable tactical decisions about the mix of enterprises and allocation of land and forage resources to be adjusted in response to climate and price. We discuss these innovations in the context of the emerging constraints to crop–livestock integration in Australia including the continuing decline in labour availability on farms and increasing management skill required to optimise enterprise profitability.","July 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:06","2014-09-21 02:40:06","","10-20","","0","57","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dual-purpose; Economics; Meta-analysis; Pasture; Perennial; Profit; Rotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, distribution data for 32 frogs, 51 salamanders, 38 snakes, 12 lizards, 16 turtles, and the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) were obtained, with most commonly reported group being snakes (5,349 records). Additionally, several records of amphibians and reptiles considered priority species by North and South Carolina were contributed to the CHA.

While high-yielding perennial grass varieties are being developed in fertilized monocultures, breeding for yield in low-input high-diversity systems would be difficult. Before initiating breeding for low-input systems, it is therefore important to know the minimum number of functional groups and species required for maximum biomass harvest from low-input grasslands. We controlled the number of perennial grassland species in 168 plots in Minnesota, USA. Species were selected at random from a pool of 18, and 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 were planted in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured annually, and the plots were burned each spring. We found a strongly positive log-linear relationship between average annual aboveground biomass and planted species number, but a large proportion of plot-to-plot variability remained unexplained. We performed a conditional analysis of the aboveground biomass data to determine whether considering species identity would reduce the minimum number of species necessary in order to achieve yields similar to the highest diversity treatments. A model that accounted for the presence of legumes in general, and for the presence of the legume species Lupinus perennis in particular, showed no increase in biomass yield with increased species number. Over 11 years, average yields of L. perennis/C4 grass bicultures were similar to those of 16-species (maximum diversity) plots, and both were &gt;200% greater than the average of monocultures. Thus, under low-input conditions, the choice of the appropriate few perennial plant species for each location might result in systems with biomass yields similar to those from high-diversity systems. Because breeding biofuel crops in diverse mixtures would introduce complexity that is unwarranted in terms of maximum biomass yield, the first biofuel crop breeding programs for low-input systems are likely to accelerate progress by focusing on grass–legume bicultures.","April 15, 2010","2014-09-21 02:39:55","2014-09-21 02:39:55","","33-38","","1–2","137","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture; Biofuel; Biomass; Grassland; Perennial; Plant breeding; Species diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Botanical considerations point clearly to the retention of perennial characteristics while archaeological and historical evidences point to cultivation with more than a single harvest from an initial planting – the practice of ratooning. Evidence is reviewed briefly for China and more extensively for Southeast Asia. Modern field evidence is used to support the notion that ratooning was probably more widespread in the past and that this practice may represent an early phase in the history of rice agriculture in Southeast Asia as it does in China.","April 2010","2014-09-21 02:40:02","2014-09-21 02:40:02","","215-223","","2","36","","Journal of Historical Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asian prehistory; History of early agriculture; Perennial crops; Rice cultivation; Southeast Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Holstein-Friesian cows, averaging 227 d in milk, were allocated into 6 groups of 36, with 2 groups randomly assigned to each of 3 feeding strategies: (1) cows grazed perennial ryegrass pasture supplemented with milled barley grain fed in the milking parlor and pasture silage offered in the paddock (control); (2) same pasture and allotment supplemented with the same amounts of milled barley grain and pasture silage, but presented as a mixed ration after each milking (PMR 1); and (3) same pasture and allotment, supplemented with a mixed ration of milled barley grain, alfalfa hay, corn silage, and crushed corn grain (PMR 2). For all strategies, supplements provided the same metabolizable energy and grain:forage ratio. [75:25, dry matter (DM) basis]. Each group of 36 cows was further allocated into 4 groups of 9, which were assigned to receive 6, 8, 10, or 12 kg of supplement DM/cow per day. Thus, there were 2 replicated groups per supplement amount per dietary strategy. The experiment had a 14-d adaptation period and an 11-d measurement period. Pasture allotment was approximately 14 kg of DM/d for all cows and was offered in addition to the supplement. Positive quadratic responses to increasing amounts of supplement were observed for yield of milk, energy-corrected milk (ECM), and fat and protein, and positive linear responses for concentrations of fat and protein for cows on all 3 supplement feeding strategies. No difference existed between feeding strategy groups in yield of milk, ECM, or protein at any amount of supplement offered, but yield and concentration of fat was higher in PMR 2 cows compared with control and PMR 1 cows at the highest amounts of supplementation. Responses in marginal ECM production per additional kilogram of supplement were also greater for PMR 2 than control and PMR 1 cows when large amounts of supplement were consumed. For all diets, marked daily variation occurred in ruminal fluid volatile fatty acids and pH, especially in cows fed the largest amounts of supplement. It was concluded that when supplements are fed to grazing dairy cows, a simple mix of grain and pasture silage has no benefit over traditional strategies of feeding grain in the parlor and forage in the paddock. However, yield of milk fat and marginal milk production responses can be greater if the strategy uses an isoenergetic ration that also contains alfalfa hay, corn silage, and corn grain.","February 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:18","2014-09-21 02:40:18","","1218-1231","","2","96","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","milk response; partial mixed ration; Pasture; Supplement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three cows were allocated to each treatment except the mid-range wheat treatment, which had 4 cows. Results were analyzed by regression because the intake of the wheat by cows within treatments varied. The hay was used to reflect the characteristics of summer pastures in southeastern Australia. Feed intake and fecal output were measured to determine digestion coefficients, feeds were incubated in nylon bags in the rumen, and rumen variables were monitored. Estimates of metabolizable energy (ME) of the hay from in vivo or in vitro digestibility were also compared. The digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was depressed linearly as the amount of crushed wheat consumed increased to 36% of DM intake. The extent to which negative associative effects on NDF digestion were associated with the hay could not be determined, as it was not possible to distinguish between the NDF from hay and that from wheat. However, acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestion also declined, suggesting that most of the response lay with the hay because ADF was negligible in the wheat. Most data indicated that effects of proportion of wheat in the diet on the utilization of consumed nutrients were small. Despite substitution of wheat for hay reducing the forage intake of cows, there was a positive linear effect on marginal milk responses (1.3 kg of energy-corrected milk/kg of DM wheat). Mean rumen fluid pH declined as the proportion of wheat in the diet increased. The lowest pH for any individual cow during a 24-h period was 5.4, and the amount of time that rumen fluid pH was &lt;6.0 ranged from 0 to 14 h depending on the amount of wheat consumed. It was concluded that these perturbations of the rumen environment were probably sufficient to result in negative associative effects. In addition, estimates of the ME content of the hay were higher when calculated from in vitro compared with in vivo digestibility, which has implications when estimating the amount of feed required for production.","June 2009","2014-09-21 02:40:32","2014-09-21 02:40:32","","2747-2757","","6","92","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","associative effect; dairy cow; digestion and rumen fermentation; pasture and grain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The manifestations of toxicity in animals are as diverse as the fungal species which produce these compounds. In addition to being acutely toxic, some mycotoxins are now linked with the incidence of certain types of cancer and it is this aspect which has evoked global concern over feed and food safety. For ruminants, the mycotoxins of relevance are those arising from fungal contamination of protein supplements of tropical origin, principally cottonseed cake and groundnut meal, and certain grasses infected with endophytes. In addition, other grains and associated by-products may be contaminated with mycotoxins. When cottonseed cake and groundnut meal become infected with Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, these meals are frequently contaminated with up to four aflatoxins, one of which (aflatoxin B1) is a carcinogen and may be converted into another potential carcinogen (aflatoxin M1) by lactating animals and secreted in milk. Aflatoxin contamination of cereals such as maize and sorghum may also occur and, in addition, worldwide contamination of maize with fumonisins has recently been reported. The fumonisins are synthesised by Fusarium moniliforme and have now been linked with the incidence of oesophageal cancer in humans and with outbreaks of animal mycotoxicoses in southern Africa. Well-defined syndromes have been identified in ruminants consuming forages naturally contaminated with toxigenic fungi. Of particular importance are the endophytic fungi of the Acremonium species which may infect tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, causing reduced productivity and neurological effects in cattle and sheep. The ergopeptine and lolitrem alkaloids have been implicated as the causative agents. In addition, infection of lupin stubbles, pods and seeds by Phomopsis leptostromiformis may result in the synthesis of the phomopsins which have been associated with lupinosis in sheep. Recent research indicates promising prospects for the development of plant genotypes devoid of, or resistant to, infection by toxigenic fungi. In the case of aflatoxin contaminated oil-seed meals, treatment with ammonia is a cost-effective method of detoxification.","November 1997","2014-09-21 02:41:03","2014-09-21 02:41:03","","155-166","","1–3","69","","Animal Feed Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Feedstuffs; Fungal contamination; Mycotoxins; Ruminants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along with genetic and agronomic innovations, diversification of northern agro-ecosystems using inter-seeded legumes provides further opportunities to improve land management practices that sustain crop yields and their resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. Benefits of legume cover crops have been known for decades and red clover (Trifolium pratense) is one of the most common and beneficial when frost-seeded under winter wheat in advance of maize in a rotation. However, its use has been declining mostly due to the use of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides, concerns over competition with the main crop and the inability to fully capture red clover benefits due to difficulties in the persistence of uniform stands. In this manuscript, we first review the environmental, agronomic, rotational and economical benefits associated with inter-seeded red clover. Red clover adaptation to a wide array of common wheat-based rotations, its potential to mitigate the effects of land degradation in a changing climate and its integration into sustainable food production systems are discussed.

The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature—an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981–2004) and terrorism (1990–2003).

Thus, the paleohydrological investigations are important in interpreting ancient fluvial systems and a comparison of different fluvial styles/systems. This study reports new paleohydrological and sedimentological data from the ca. 1.17 Ga-old fluvial deposits (Svinsaga Formation) in the Fennoscandian Shield, which is a part of the East European Craton. The Mesoproterozoic Svinsaga Formation overlies a major unconformity (sub-Svinsaga unconformity) in the Telemark Supracrustal rocks (southern Norway). The unconformity corresponding to a ca. 170-Ma hiatus (ca. 1347–1170 Ma) and carry evidence for ancient periglacial climatic conditions. Eleven different sedimentary lithofacies and five lithofacies associations were recognized from the Svinsaga Formation. The lithofacies assemblages indicate that the formation represents a relatively high-energy braided fluvial environment. Massive breccias, massive and inversely to normally graded conglomerates, stratified sandstones and laminated and rippled mudstones, were transported by traction currents, sediment gravity flows and by suspension. The proximal part of the formation contains blockfield/blockslope accumulations and waning flood-flow cycles. These are overlain by hyperconcentrated and debris flow deposits, and ephemeral high-energy bedforms. The distal part of the formation contains dune bedforms and channel lag deposits, which indicate waning discharge fluctuations. The paleohydrological calculations from the channel-fill conglomerates and sandstone bedforms correlate with lithofacies assemblages. The estimation of paleoslope and discharge values supports the presence of a fluvial stream rather than an alluvial fan environment. The stream power and water velocity systematically decreases towards the distal parts of the formation. The abundance of the waning flood-flow cycles, ephemeral high-energy sedimentary deposits, and hyperconcentrated and debris flow deposits is a possible indicator of periglacial melt waters in basin margin strike–slip fault evolution. This melt water combined with abundantly available debris from the non-vegetated high-topographic landscape.","May 1, 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:50","2014-09-21 02:41:50","","239-255","","3–4","236","","Sedimentary Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Braided stream; Lithofacies; Mesoproterozoic; Paleohydrology; Southern Norway; Telemark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach involves the development of a perennial grain sorghum by crossing tetraploid Sorghum bicolor with wild S. halepense to combine high seed yield with overwintering ability via rhizome production. We grew tetraploid S. bicolor, F-1 hybrid (BC0), and two backcross generations (BC, and BC,) in a randomized block design to examine total biomass, seed yield, and allocation to plant parts within and across generations. Root, rhizome, stem and leaf, and total biomass decreased from the BC, to BC, to S. bicolor generations, whereas panicle mass, seed mass, and reproductive allocation were lowest in the BC0 generation (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Mean seed mass (g.plant(-1)) was 39.1 in the BC0, 107.3 in the BC1, 84.1 in the BC2, and 92.7 for the S. bicolor parent, which translated into yields of 171.9, 471.6, 396.7, and 407.5 g.m(-2), respectively. Reproductive allocation varied from 14.7% in BC0 to 28.9% in BC2 compared with 33.5% in S. bicolor. Mean allocation to rhizomes was 2.71% in BC0 but negligible in BC1 and BC2. There was no relationship between rhizome mass and seed mass within any generation, but there was a positive correlation between total plant mass and rhizome mass in BC0. We divided the BC0 population into four groups with respect to rhizome production and found no significant differences among the groups in plant size or seed yield. Within each generation, reproductive allocation was inversely related to culm mass. The lack of an apparent trade-off between allocation to rhizome versus allocation to seed within any generation supports the possibility of combining within a population high seed yield and production of perennating belowground organs.","April 1994","2015-06-01 16:22:23","2015-06-01 16:22:23","","468-474","","4","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","BACKCROSS; HYBRID; Perennial grains; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; Rhizome; SEED MASS; SORGHUM BICOLOR; SORGHUM HALEPENSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aphid-transmitted viruses account for approximately 50% of the 600 known viruses with an invertebrate vector. Barrier plants may act as real natural sinks for non-persistent aphid-transmitted viruses and have proved in the past to be an effective crop management strategy to protect against virus infection. Increasing the knowledge on aphid host seeking and flying behaviour, and on how barrier plants may affect the behaviour of aphids and their natural enemies will allow further development of this environmentally-friendly habitat manipulation strategy. An ideal plant barrier should be a non-host for the virus and the vector, but appealing to aphid landing and attractive to their natural enemies and should allow sufficient residence time to allow aphid probing before taking-off occurs. In this review, we have addressed why aphids are manageable by barrier cropping, the mechanisms by which barrier plants affect the occurrence of non-persistently aphid-transmitted viruses and the limitations of using barrier plants as a virus control strategy. Finally, we have pointed out future directions of research that should be conducted to integrate barrier cropping with other disease management strategies, and optimise and extend the use of barrier plants as a strategy for managing aphid-transmitted virus diseases.","September 2006","2014-09-21 02:42:17","2014-09-21 02:42:17","","1-16","","1–2","120","","Virus Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aphids; Disease management; Plant viruses; Vegetables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two major stages are presented in this life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis: pre-farm, and on-farm. The pre-farm stage includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural machinery, fertilizer, and pesticide production and the emissions from the transportation of these inputs to paddock. The on-farm stage includes GHG emissions due to diesel use in on-farm transport and processing (e.g. seeding, spraying, harvesting, topdressing, sheep shearing), and non-CO2 (nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4)) emissions from pastures and crop grazing of lambs. The functional unit of this life cycle analysis is the GHG emissions (carbon dioxide equivalents – CO2 -e) from 1 kg of wheat, sheep meat and wool produced from sub-clover, wheat and mixed pasture plots. The GHG emissions (e.g. CO2, N2O and CH4 emission) from the production, transportation and use of inputs (e.g. fertilizer, pesticide, farm machinery operation) during pre-farm and on-farm stages are also included. The life cycle GHG emissions of 1 kg of wool is significantly higher than that of wheat and sheep meat. The LCA analysis identified that the on-farm stage contributed the most significant portion of total GHG emissions from the production of wheat, sheep meat and wool. This LCA analysis also identified that CH4 emissions from enteric methane production and from the decomposition of manure accounted for a significant portion of the total emissions from sub-clover and mixed pasture production, whilst N2O emissions from the soil have been found to be the major source of GHG emissions from wheat production.","September 2010","2014-09-21 02:40:44","2014-09-21 02:40:44","","1386-1392","","14","18","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crop; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Mixed pasture; Sheep meat; Wheat; Wool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report parasitism rates by this tachinid fly in wild captured monarchs, using data collected over 7 y by 77 volunteers in the Monarch Larva Monitoring Project, a North American Citizen Science Program. Data were collected in 21 U.S. states and one Canadian province, with focus sites in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina. Overall, approximately 13% of monarch larvae contained tachinid flies. Parasitism rates varied by year, and this variation was, to a large extent, region-wide. For example, larvae collected in 2000–2002 throughout the Upper Midwestern U.S. suffered significantly more parasitism than those collected in 1999 or 2003–2005. There were no consistent patterns with respect to date of collection within years. The number of flies per parasitized monarch ranged from one to 10 and comparison to a Poisson distribution indicated that flies were more aggregated within hosts than expected by chance. Larvae collected during later stadia were both more likely to be parasitized and contained more flies per larva. Whereas the first pattern is likely to be the result of longer exposure to parasitoids, the latter suggests that females either respond to larger hosts by laying more eggs or that superparasitism (parasitism by more than one individual) occurs. When more than four flies emerged from a single host, their mean pupa mass was smaller, suggesting a cost to superparasitism. We report six cases of hyperparasitism by a wasp in the family Perilampidae. When three milkweed species with varying levels of cardenolides occurred in one area, monarchs found on a species with low cardenolide levels (Asclepias syriaca) were most likely to be parasitized, but those found on a species with very high levels of cardenolides (A. curassavica) showed higher levels of parasitism than those on found on the less toxic A. incarnata. Potential impacts of L. archippivora on monarch butterflies are discussed in light of these findings.","2007-04-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","312-328","","2","157","","The American Midland Naturalist","Parasitism of Monarch Butterflies (Danaus Plexippus) by Lespesia Archippivora (Diptera","","","","","","","","","","","","BioOne","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/R3Z9QVFD/oberhauser_parasitism_2007.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phenotypic hybrid zone between mimetic and nonmimetic admiral butterflies, comprising the polytypic Limenitis arthemis species complex, offers an ideal opportunity to test these predictions because the position of the hybrid zone is hypothesized to be controlled by the geographic range of Battus philenor, the chemically defended model. We used 29 years of observational field data from a continental-scale butterfly monitoring program, the 4th of July Butterfly Counts, to show that (1) the advantage of mimicry does not extend beyond the range of the model, (2) in contrast to expectations, the mimicry complex is maintained even where the model is rare and (3) the sharp phenotypic transition between mimetic and nonmimetic admiral populations occurs over a very narrow spatial scale corresponding to the limit of the model's range. These results suggest that, even at very low densities, there is selection for Batesian mimicry and it maintains the geographic position of this hybrid zone.

We first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included. These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users, the interaction between users and data, and the types of information generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of environmental monitoring.

Many programs are ill-equipped to effectively manage these data. We examined the art and science of multi-scale citizen science support, focusing on issues of integration and flexibility that arise for data management when programs span multiple spatial, temporal, and social scales across many domains. Our objectives were to: (1) briefly review existing citizen science approaches and data management needs; (2) propose a framework for multi-scale citizen science support; (3) develop a cyber-infrastructure to support citizen science program needs; and (4) describe lessons learned. We find that approaches differ in scope, scale, and activities and that the proposed framework situates programs while guiding cyber-infrastructure system development. We built a cyber-infrastructure support system for citizen science programs (www.citsci.org) and show that carefully designed systems can be adept enough to support programs at multiple spatial and temporal scales across many domains when built with a flexible architecture. The advantage of a flexible, yet controlled, cyber-infrastructure system lies in the ability of users with different levels of permission to easily customize the features themselves, while adhering to controlled vocabularies necessary for cross-discipline comparisons and meta-analyses. Program evaluation tied to this framework and integrated into cyber-infrastructure support systems will improve our ability to track effectiveness. We compare existing systems and discuss the importance of standards for interoperability and the challenges associated with system maintenance and long-term support.

However, even when clearly complying with regulations for organic production, it is not always obvious that these goals are reached. As an example, strong dependence on import of manure is often seen in current organic production, especially in systems producing high value crops such as vegetable crops. The aim of the present study was to test novel approaches to organic rotations, designed to reduce the reliance on import of external resources significantly. We compared a conventional system (C) and an organic system relying on manure import for soil fertility (O1) to two novel systems (O2 and O3) all based on the same crop rotation. The O2 and O3 systems represented new versions of the organic rotation, both relying on green manures and catch crops grown during the autumn after the main crop as their main source of soil fertility, and the O3 system further leaving rows of the green manures to grow as intercrops between vegetable rows to improve the conditions for biodiversity and natural pest regulation in the crops. Reliance on resource import to the systems differed, with average annual import of nitrogen fertilizers of 149, 85, 25 and 25 kg N ha−1 in the C, O1, O2 and O3 systems, respectively. As expected, the crop yields were lower in the organic system. It differed strongly among crop species, but on average the organic crops yielded c. 82% of conventional yields in all three organic systems, when calculated based on the area actually grown with the main crops. In the O3 system some of the area of the vegetable fields was allocated to intercrops, so vegetable yields calculated based on total land area was only 63% of conventional yields. Differences in quality parameters of the harvested crops, i.e. nutrient content, dry matter content or damages by pests or diseases were few and not systematic, whereas clear effects on nutrient balances and nitrogen leaching indicators were found. Root growth of all crops was studied in the C and O2 system, but only few effects of cropping system on root growth was observed. However, the addition of green manures to the systems almost doubled the average soil exploration by active root systems during the rotation from only 21% in C to 38% in O2 when measured to 2.4 m depth. This relates well to the observed differences in subsoil inorganic N content (Ninorg, 1–2 m depth) across the whole rotation (74 and 61 kg N ha−1 in C and O1 vs. only 22 and 21 kg N ha−1 in O2 and O3), indicating a strongly reduced N leaching loss in the two systems based on fertility building crops (green manures and catch crops). In short, the main distinctions were not observed between organic and conventional systems (i.e. C vs. O1, O2 and O3), but between systems based mainly on nutrient import vs. systems based mainly on fertility building crops (C and O1 vs. O2 and O3).","February 2012","2014-09-21 02:40:58","2014-09-21 02:40:58","","66-82","","1","37","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Catch crop; Cereals; cover crop; Green manure; Intercrop; Soil nitrogen; Vegetable quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This process has greatly improved crop performance and can allow farmers to produce viable harvests in previously un-profitable circumstances. However, there is growing evidence that domestication may impact species interactions perhaps through the amplification of effects across spatial scales and so have a pervasive influence on the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems. This can occur directly, through unintentional alteration to crop traits that disrupt the host-finding ability of natural enemies; or indirectly through alterations to within-plant nutritional quality that impacts herbivore size and density and then ramifies throughout food chains. At the field level, the low variability in traits between individual plants means that particular weed and invertebrate communities are associated with each crop type. At the landscape level, the use of one or a few varieties across wide spatial scales, planted and harvested relatively synchronously, further reduces diversity. This process acting across multiple spatial scales represents a considerable selection pressure that may result in feedback-loops which favour the occurrence of particular traits within the community (e.g. resistance to pesticides). In order to properly balance the ‘pros and cons’ of the widespread adoption of new varieties, for the future, we must consider how particular traits influence interactions within the wider ecological community, and how these effects amplify across spatial scales. Here we argue that the process of domestication (with the primary goal of yield increases) and the widespread use of a few varieties has led to potentially detrimental impacts on species interactions, and suggest possible strategies for mitigating some of these negative impacts in the future.","March 2010","2014-09-21 02:41:15","2014-09-21 02:41:15","","116-125","","2","11","","Basic and Applied Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroecosystems; Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Parasitoids; Pest control; Predators; Species interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It may guide physicians and patients towards better prevention strategies, diagnosis, and treatment. Methods One hundred and twenty four patients suffering from rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma from different cities around the country, and consulting our allergy clinic between January 2008 and December 2008, were reviewed in a randomized, retrospective study. Skin prick-tests to a battery of perennial or seasonal allergens were performed to all patients during their visit. An airborne pollen investigation was performed in different cities around the country during this period. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life (RQLQ) and the Asthma Quality of Life (AQLQ) questionnaires were used to assess the severity of symptoms. Results of the symptoms evaluation were then correlated to the peaks and total concentrations of airborne pollens. Results The airborne pollen sampling showed that Cupressaceae species were the dominant pollen persisting almost at all seasons. A tremendous surge in pollen count was noted in March at all stations with remarkably high level of pollen averaging about 400 pollen/m3/day in the one station. Pollens such as olive, and grass were noted as the spring developed. Urticaceae most likely of the Parietaria species, the pollen specific to the Mediterranean area was noted starting in the spring at all stations. The incidence of exacerbations of rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma was highest during the spring season with a frequency of 58.87%. There was another lower peak in the fall with a frequency of 23.3%. A total of 15.32% of patients were allergic to Cupressaceae; 73.68% of them experienced symptoms during spring and 52.63% during fall. A total of 17.75% were allergic to grass; 59.1% of these patients suffered of symptoms during spring and 36.36% during the fall. A total of 24.2% were allergic to Parietaria; 76.67% of these patients endured symptoms during spring and 43.3% during fall. A total of 16.2% were allergic to olive; 70% of these patients experienced symptoms during spring and 30% during fall. A total of 24.2% were allergic to mites; 36.67% of these patients experienced symptoms during spring and 30% during fall. Conclusion There was a good correlation between the peaks of the pollen count and the exacerbations of rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first study of clinical correlation with pollen count done in Lebanon. Continued monitoring and further studies will confirm our data, and support in better diagnosis and treatment of pollen-related allergic diseases.","September 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:40","2014-09-21 02:40:40","","441-445","","5","53","","Revue Française d'Allergologie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis; Asthma; Asthme; Clinical correlation; Compte pollinique; Corrélation clinique; Pollen; Pollen count; Rhinoconjonctivite allergique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an old agricultural practice carried on by farmers since early historical times, but recently it has been improved by technology. Many foods consumed today are either genetically modified (GM) whole foods, or contain ingredients derived from gene modification technology. Billions of dollars in U.S. food exports are realized from sales of GM seeds and crops. Despite the potential benefits of genetic engineering of foods, the technology is surrounded by controversy. Critics of GM technology include consumer and health groups, grain importers from European Union (EU) countries, organic farmers, environmentalists, concerned scientists, ethicists, religious rights groups, food advocacy groups, some politicians and trade protectionists. Some of the specific fears expressed by opponents of GM technology include alteration in nutritional quality of foods, potential toxicity, possible antibiotic resistance from GM crops, potential allergenicity and carcinogenicity from consuming GM foods. In addition, some more general concerns include environmental pollution, unintentional gene transfer to wild plants, possible creation of new viruses and toxins, limited access to seeds due to patenting of GM food plants, threat to crop genetic diversity, religious, cultural and ethical concerns, as well as fear of the unknown. Supporters of GM technology include private industries, research scientists, some consumers, U.S. farmers and regulatory agencies. Benefits presented by proponents of GM technology include improvement in fruit and vegetable shelf-life and organoleptic quality, improved nutritional quality and health benefits in foods, improved protein and carbohydrate content of foods, improved fat quality, improved quality and quantity of meat, milk and livestock. Other potential benefits are: the use of GM livestock to grow organs for transplant into humans, increased crop yield, improvement in agriculture through breeding insect, pest, disease, and weather resistant crops and herbicide tolerant crops, use of GM plants as bio-factories to yield raw materials for industrial uses, use of GM organisms in drug manufacture, in recycling and/or removal of toxic industrial wastes. The potential risks and benefits of the new technology to man and the environment are reviewed. Ways of minimizing potential risks and maximizing the benefits of GM foods are suggested. Because the benefits of GM foods apparently far outweigh the risks, regulatory agencies and industries involved in GM food business should increase public awareness in this technology to enhance worldwide acceptability of GM foods. This can be achieved through openness, education, and research.","May 2000","2014-09-21 02:41:11","2014-09-21 02:41:11","","179-206","","3","18","","Biotechnology Advances","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural biotechnology; Controversy; Environment; Genetically modified foods; Health; Risks and benefits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low dry matter intake (DMI) of pasture has been identified as a major factor limiting milk production by high producing dairy cows. Pasture DMI in grazing cows is a function of grazing time, biting rate, and bite mass. Concentrate supplementation did not affect biting rate (58 bites/min) or bite mass (0.47 g of DM/bite) but reduced grazing time 12 min/d per kilogram of concentrate compared with unsupplemented cows (574 min/d). Substitution rate, or the reduction in pasture DMI per kilogram of concentrate, is a factor which may explain the variation in milk response to supplementation. A negative relationship exists between substitution rate and milk response; the lower the substitution rate the higher the milk response to supplements. Milk production increases linearly as the amount of concentrate increases from 1.2 to 10 kg DM/d, with an overall milk response of 1 kg milk/kg concentrate. Compared with pasture-only diets, increasing the amount of concentrate supplementation up to 10 kg DM/d increased total DMI 24%, milk production 22%, and milk protein percentage 4%, but reduced milk fat percentage 6%. Compared with dry ground corn, supplementation with nonforage fiber sources or processed corn did not affect total DMI, milk production, or milk composition. Replacing ruminal degradable protein sources with ruminal undegradable protein sources in concentrates did not consistently affect milk production or composition. Forage supplementation did not affect production when substitution rate was high. Fat supplementation increased milk production by 6%, without affecting milk fat and protein content. Increasing concentrate from 1.1 to 10 kg DM/d reduced ruminal pH 0.08 and NH3-N concentration 6.59 mg/dl, compared with pasture-only diets. Replacing dry corn by high moisture corn, steam-flaked or steam-rolled corn, barley, or fiber-based concentrates reduced ruminal NH3-N concentration 4.36 mg/dl. Supplementation did not affect in situ pasture digestion, except for a reduction in rate of degradation when high amounts of concentrate were supplemented. Supplementation with energy concentrates reduced digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and intake of N but did not affect digestibility of organic matter or flow of microbial N.","January 2003","2014-09-21 02:41:45","2014-09-21 02:41:45","","1-42","","1","86","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","high producing dairy cow; milk production and composition; Pasture; supplementation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through this case study, we unpack assumptions from the volunteerism literature and apply theories of co-production to understand how citizens evaluate science and produce knowledge while conducting wildlife monitoring. We demonstrate that the project maintains a healthy give and take between the state and the volunteers as they work together to manage endangered sea turtles. When tensions do emerge over specific issues such as nest relocation, volunteers engage with scientific debates and apply their knowledge gained through the project to push their priorities. While volunteers understand the state’s position on conservation science, they counter with evidence from scientific literature and locally situated observations informed by an alternative view of human–environment relationships and specific goals for the project. Overall, we find that there is little evidence to support the notion that knowledge is ‘co-produced’ in the project. Instead, the combination of volunteer control over the local spaces of conservation and the state’s need for volunteer labor results in the co-production of conservation practice.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:53","2012-12-20","101-120","","1","42","","Social Studies of Science","Co-producing conservation and knowledge","","","","","","","en","","","","","sss.sagepub.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/XAJ48RNC/cornwell_co-producing_2012.pdf","","","boundary work26; citizen science27; co-production28; volunteer29; wildlife conservation30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rotation sequence was repeated twice. Natural 15N abundance techniques were used to determine grain legume N2 fixation and 15N labeling technique to determine the fate of pea and oat residue N recovery in the subsequent crop. The subsequent spring wheat and winter triticale crop yields were not significantly affected by the previous main crop, but a significant effect of catch crop undersowing was observed. A higher soil mineral N content in the soil profile without undersown grass-clover increased the spring wheat yield. This effect was circumvented in the subsequent winter triticale, where yields in the treatments with catch crops undersown were significantly greater. The grass-clover catch crop after grain legumes had a higher grass proportion before incorporation as compared to grass-clover after oat, which had the greatest clover proportion. The dynamic response of interspecific interactions in the catch crop to the soil mineral N levels is moderating the preceding effect of main crops in the subsequent cereal – and sometimes to a higher degree than the main crop effect. For research involving rotation principles it is recommended to evaluate cumulative effects over several years and not only single seasons.","September 20, 2012","2014-09-21 02:40:12","2014-09-21 02:40:12","","23-31","","0","136","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropping system; Precrop effect; Residual N effect; Rotation; Symbiotic N2 fixation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However success requires that the mechanism responsible for among animal variation in emissions is repeatable and heritable and has a negligible negative impact on production and functional traits. This study was designed to estimate repeatability and heritability of the CH4 emission trait in sheep, and to determine whether the ranking of sheep based on their CH4 emissions is maintained over a range of contrasting diets. A flock of 105 ewe lambs (10 months old) of a progeny testing program were screened for their CH4 yields (i.e., emissions/unit feed dry matter (DM) intake) when a molasses containing grass silage was fed at restricted intake (1.3 × maintenance metabolisable energy requirements). Methane emissions were measured on a single day in respiration chambers over 4 measurement periods with 13–15 d between consecutive measurements (i.e., screening phase). Mean CH4 yield of lambs was 18.4 ± 0.38 g/kg DM intake during the screening phase, and estimates of repeatability and heritability for CH4 yield were 0.16 and 0.30, respectively. Methane yield in the screening phase was 7.9% higher for the high versus low ranked sheep (19.2 ± 0.18 versus 17.8 ± 0.26 g/kg DM intake). The 10 lowest (low rank) and the 10 highest (high rank) CH4 yielding sheep were selected and retained for further study. Two repeated measurements of CH4 yield were conducted, the first measurement while sheep were fed fresh cut perennial ryegrass pasture (grass), the second with the same sheep fed a 400:600 concentrate:forage (wheat grain:lucerne hay; fresh basis) pelleted diet (pellet). Repeated measurements revealed that rankings were maintained among diets, but that there was a CH4 rank × diet interaction for CH4 yield. When fed the grass diet, the high ranked sheep had 13% higher CH4 yield than the low ranked sheep, but when fed the pelleted diet, the high ranked sheep had 36% higher CH4 yield than the low ranked sheep. Emissions of hydrogen were only measurable when sheep were fed the pelleted diet. This study is the first to report that ranking of sheep for CH4 emissions is consistent among diets, although the magnitude of difference among the rankings was affected by diet, suggesting that among animal variation in CH4 emission could be exploited to breed animals for low CH4 emission.

We used a series of analytical metrics to compare results using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) multihabitat, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency multihabitat, and EPA single-habitat sampling protocols. We also investigated the effect of 2 scenarios in which volunteers fail to follow (and potentially bias) the widely used EPA multihabitat protocol by including either more snag and vegetated banks or more run and riffle habitat than prescribed by the protocol. We collected jab samples from cobble, snags, vegetated banks, submerged macrophytes, and sand in 4 contiguous 125-m reaches in an Anoka sand-plain stream in Minnesota. We identified up to 100 macroinvertebrates in each jab sample to family. We subjected a parent population of 40 jab samples/reach to a bootstrap analysis to sample and create metric or index scores 100 times without replacement for each of the 3 volunteer sampling methods and 2 biased scenarios. The EPA multihabitat protocol and the biased scenario in which woody debris and bank vegetation were oversampled yielded the highest diversity of organisms, whereas the biased scenario in which riffle and run habitats were oversampled yielded the lowest diversity. The EPA multihabitat protocol used correctly was more likely to indicate “good” water quality (on the basis of the EPA muddy-bottom narrative assessment tool designed for volunteers) than either biased sampling scenario. This result illustrates that poor field methods could result in underestimation of water quality.","2008-09-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","640-646","","3","27","","Journal of the North American Benthological Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioOne","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/N3MUHUV8/nerbonne_effect_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite higher prices received for milk, organic dairy farmers have come under increasing financial stress due to increases in concentrated feed prices over the past few years, which can make up one-third of variable costs. Market demand for milk has also leveled in the last year, resulting in some downward pressure on prices paid to dairy farmers. Organic dairy farmers in the Northeast United States have experimented with growing different forage and grain crops to maximize on-farm production of protein and energy to improve profitability. Three representative organic feed systems were simulated using the integrated farm system model for farms with 30, 120, and 220 milk cows. Increasing intensity of equipment use was represented by organic dairy farms growing only perennial sod (low) to those with corn-based forage systems, which purchase supplemental grain (medium) or which produce and feed soybeans (high). The relative profitability of these 3 organic feed systems was strongly dependent on dairy farm size. From results, we suggest smaller organic dairy farms can be more profitable with perennial sod-based rather than corn-based forage systems due to lower fixed costs from using only equipment associated with perennial forage harvest and storage. The largest farm size was more profitable using a corn-based system due to greater economies of scale for growing soybeans, corn grain, winter cereals, and corn silages. At an intermediate farm size of 120 cows, corn-based forage systems were more profitable if perennial sod was not harvested at optimum quality, corn was grown on better soils, or if milk yield was 10% higher. Delayed harvest decreased the protein and energy content of perennial sod crops, requiring more purchased grain to balance the ration and resulting in lower profits. Corn-based systems were less affected by lower perennial forage quality, as corn silage is part of the forage base. Growing on better soils increased corn yields more than perennial forage yields. Large corn-based organic dairy farms that produced and fed soybeans minimized off-farm grain purchases and were the most profitable among large farms. Although perennial sod-based systems purchased more grain, these organic systems were more profitable under timely forage harvest, decreased soil quality, and relatively lower purchased energy prices and higher protein supplement prices.","November 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:22","2014-09-21 02:40:22","","5710-5723","","11","94","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","dairy; economic; integrated farm system model; Organic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Citizen scientists may be able to extend the spatial and temporal extent of pollinator monitoring programs. We developed a citizen-science monitoring protocol in which we trained 13 citizen scientists to observe and classify floral visitors at the resolution of orders or super families (e.g., bee, wasp, fly) and at finer resolution within bees (superfamily Apoidea) only. We evaluated the protocol by comparing data collected simultaneously at 17 sites by citizen scientists (observational data set) and by professionals (specimen-based data set). The sites differed with respect to the presence and age of hedgerows planted to improve habitat quality for pollinators. We found significant, positive correlations among the two data sets for higher level taxonomic composition, honey bee (Apis mellifera) abundance, non-Apis bee abundance, bee richness, and bee community similarity. Results for both data sets also showed similar trends (or lack thereof) in these metrics among sites differing in the presence and age of hedgerows. Nevertheless, citizen scientists did not observe approximately half of the bee groups collected by professional scientists at the same sites. Thus, the utility of citizen-science observational data may be restricted to detection of community-level changes in abundance, richness, or similarity over space and time, and citizen-science observations may not reliably reflect the abundance or frequency of occurrence of specific pollinator species or groups.","2011","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","607–617","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","en","©2011 Society for Conservation Biology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/VGNBQATV/kremen_evaluating_2011.pdf","","","abeja; Apoidea; artrópodo; monitoreo de polinización; monitoreo ecológico; observador voluntario; visitante floral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper provides a typology of these observers: the zoo directors, assistants, keepers, animal painters, and the “common” visitor. What did they observe and what were their motivations? Did they pursue a certain agenda? What kind of knowledge, if any, did they produce? Soon the issue of the reliability of these observations emerged. Lay observers insisted on the veracity of their intimate and personal knowledge of animals while academics complained that their claims could not be generalized and were tainted by anthropomorphism. Hence the focus on the observations of these laymen will reveal contemporary assumptions on what may count as “scientific.” This is closely linked to the question of how far the zoo may qualify as a site of scientific investigation in the first place. The constraints on doing research on animals in a public space such as the zoo were numerous. Yet despite these obstacles the zoological garden contributed to the rise of ecological thinking as well as to the formation of ethology as a scientific discipline.","2011","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","183-214","","02","24","","","Watching Exotic Animals Next Door","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Journals Online","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/EEJNRMDI/Hochadel - 2011 - Watching Exotic Animals Next Door “Scientific” Ob.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Growing urgency to address these problems and the European Union's global leadership role motivate the baseline assessment of the potential for sustainable bioenergy production in the most recent two EU member states (Bulgaria and Romania) and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by reviewing the literature and drawing on available data. The paper integrates the monitoring and assessment of ecological and environmental indicators with management practices, and shows that there is still a lack of knowledge and approaches at this nexus. The main factors to be considered by the countries included in our study are: the type of energy carrier, the transportation and production processes, as well as the long-term environmental impacts associated with intensive biomass production. Specifically, the baseline assessment is using typical indicators to describe bioenergy carriers and their production and consumption in thermal or mass units as well as in percentage shares of total renewable energy produced or consumed. Our findings indicate that the potential for developing sustainable bioenergy production is generally small but with considerable cross-country variation. Only Bulgaria, Romania, and Kazakhstan are endowed with the necessary natural, climatic, and economic conditions to develop sustainable biomass productions and markets.","September 2011","2014-09-21 02:42:00","2014-09-21 02:42:00","","1009-1019","","5","11","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bioenergy; Bioenergy indicators; Biomass; Bulgaria; Caucasus; Central Asia; Romania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens).","June 2014","2015-06-01 16:22:21","2015-06-01 16:22:21","","383-397","","3","289","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Auxin signaling; Grasses; Gravitropism; Perenniality; Phototropism; Rhizomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizers for survival. In recent decades, N fertilizers have been linked to numerous environmental hazards including marine eutrophication, global warming, groundwater contamination, and stratospheric ozone destruction. Some researchers suggest that legumes, which can support biological N2 fixation, offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping systems. This perspective is countered by researchers who argue that, (1) legume-derived N has equally negative environmental impacts as the N derived from synthetic fertilizers, and (2) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural systems that depend on legumes for N inputs. In this review, we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial sources in terms of ecological integrity, energetics and food security. We conclude that obtaining N from legumes is potentially more sustainable than from industrial sources. We further suggest that while some countries are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production, many countries have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of less meat-intensive diets, and reduction of food waste.","May 2004","2014-09-21 02:41:29","2014-09-21 02:41:29","","279-297","","3","102","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy; Fertilizer; Legume; Nitrogen; Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was conducted to identify more water use efficient forage species than the dominant dairy forage, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Seventeen annual forage species were investigated under optimum irrigation (I1) and two deficit irrigation treatments (nominally 66 and 33% of irrigation water applied to the optimal level), over 3 years at Camden, NSW, on a brown Dermsol in a warm temperate climate. Forages with the highest yield generally had the highest WUEt (total yield/evapotranspiration). Under optimal irrigation, there was a three-fold difference in mean annual WUEt between forages, with maize (Zea mays L.) having the highest (42.9 kg ha−1 mm−1) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) the lowest (13.5 kg ha−1 mm−1), with 11 of the forage species having a greater WUEt than perennial ryegrass. The ‘harvested’ forages maize, wheat, triticale (Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.) and maple pea (Pisum sativium L.) generally had higher mean WUEt (26.7–42.9 kg ha−1 mm−1) than the remaining forages which were defoliated multiple times to simulate grazing (13.5–30.1 kg ha−1 mm−1). The reduction in annual WUEt in response to deficit irrigation was greatest for the warm season forages with up to 30% reduction for maize, while most of the cool season annuals were not significantly affected by deficit irrigation at the levels imposed. In order to maximize WUEt of any forage, it is necessary to maximize yield, as there is a strong positive relationship between yield and WUEt. However, while WUEt is an important criterion for choosing dairy forages, it is only one factor in a complex system. Choice of forages must be considered on a whole farm basis and include consideration of yield, nutritive value, cost of production and risk.","March 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:42","2014-09-21 02:40:42","","759-774","","5","98","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Corn; Crops; Dairy cows; Forbs; Grasses; Legumes; Pastures; Water accounting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We had three goals for our research: (1) construct a data set of mobility estimates for the butterfly species of Canada based on naturalists’ knowledge; (2) develop methods to evaluate aspects of accuracy and precision for knowledge-based ecological research such as ours; and (3) using our data set, test mobility-related hypotheses of species-level relationships. We distributed a questionnaire to amateur and professional lepidopterists in Canada and northern USA, asking them to estimate the mobility of Canadian butterfly species based on their field experience. Based on responses from 51 lepidopterists with approximately 800 years of combined field experience, we received mobility estimates for almost all (291 out of 307) of Canada’s butterfly taxa. Mobility estimates were consistent among respondents and were not affected by respondent expertise. Mobility carries a strong phylogenetic signal and is positively related to wingspan (albeit weakly), range size, and host plant breadth, and negatively related to conservation risk. Reliance upon naturalists’ experience was essential to the feasibility of our project, and provides a promising method for many types of ecological research.","2011-09-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","2273-2295","","10","20","","Biodivers Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/BCSEZDQV/burke_mobility_2011.pdf","","","Dispersal; Evolutionary Biology161; Expert opinion; Lepidoptera; Life-history strategy; Local ecological knowledge; Movement ecology; Naturalists; Phylogenetic signal; Plant Sciences159; Questionnaire; Range size; Tree Biology160","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study compared non-renewable energy inputs, energy output, and energy use efficiency of nine dryland cropping systems comprised of a factorial combination of three methods of input management [high (HIGH), i.e., conventional tillage plus full recommended rates of fertilizer and pesticides; reduced (RED), i.e., conservation tillage plus reduced rates of fertilizer and pesticides; and organic (ORG), i.e., conventional tillage plus N-fixing legumes and non-chemical means of weed and pest control]; and three crop rotation systems with varying levels of cropping diversity [a fallow-based rotation with low crop diversity (LOW); a diversified rotation using annual cereal, oilseed and pulse grains (DAG); and a diversified rotation using annual grains and perennial forages (DAP)]. The study was conducted over the 1996–2007 period on a Dark Brown Chernozemic soil (Typic Boroll) in the Canadian Prairies. As expected, total direct plus indirect energy input was the highest for the HIGH and RED input treatments (3773 MJ ha−1 year−1), and 50% less for ORG management. Most of the energy savings came from the non-use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides in the ORG management treatments. Further, total energy use was the highest for the DAG treatments (3572 MJ ha−1 year−1), and similar but about 18% lower for the DAP and LOW crop diversity treatments compared to DAG. Thus, overall, the HIGH/DAG and RED/DAG systems had the highest energy requirements (4409 MJ ha−1 year−1) and ORG/DAP had the lowest (1806 MJ ha−1 year−1). Energy output (calorimetric energy content) was typically the highest for the HIGH input treatments (26,541 MJ ha−1 year−1), was about 4% less with RED, and 37% less with ORG management. The latter reflected the lower crop yields obtained with organic management. Similarly, energy output was the highest for the DAP treatments (25,008 MJ ha−1 year−1), about 5% less for DAG, and 20% less for the LOW crop diversity treatments. The higher energy output with the DAP treatments largely reflected that the entire harvested biomass of the forage crops was included in energy output, while for grain crops only the seed was included. The straw and crop residues from annual crops were returned to the land to protect the soil from erosion and to maintain soil organic matter as this is the recommended practice in this semi-arid region. In contrast to energy output and to net energy produced, energy use efficiency (measured as yield of grain plus forage produced per unit of energy input or as energy output/energy input ratio) was the highest for the ORG input treatments (497 kg of harvested production GJ−1 of energy input, and an energy output/energy input ratio of 8.8). We obtained lower, but generally similar energy use efficiency for the HIGH and RED input treatments (392 kg GJ−1 and ratio of 7.1). Thus, overall, ORG/DAP was the most energy efficient cropping system, while RED/LOW and RED/DAG generally ranked the lowest in energy use efficiency. Our findings support the current movement of producers toward ORG management as a means of reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy inputs and improving overall energy use efficiency of their cropping systems. Our results also suggest that moving away from traditional monoculture cereal rotations that employ frequent summer fallowing, toward extended and diversified crop rotations that use reduced tillage methods, although resulting in an increase in energy output, will not significantly reduce the overall reliance on non-renewable energy inputs, nor enhance energy use efficiency, unless perennial legume forages and/or legume grain crops are included in the cropping mix.","February 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:13","2014-09-21 02:40:13","","113-123","","2","34","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual grains; Cropping systems; Energy inputs; Energy output; Energy use efficiency; Forage crops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two fields were converted from long-term perennial hay/pasture to annual cropping, while the third field served as a control field that was maintained as hay/pasture. One converted field had a rotation of oat–canola–oat crops, while the second was hay–oat–fallow. Weather was an important driver of inter-annual variability, with poor yields on all fields in 2011 because of dry conditions in summer, with the summer-fallow condition on one field caused by excess spring moisture not allowing planting. The cumulative net ecosystem production of the oat–canola–oat field showed a net CO2 emission of 100 g C m−2, the hay–oat–fallow field emitted 500 g C m−2, and the hay field gained 550 g C m−2 by the end of the 30-month study period. The hay field had the highest cumulative gross primary production of 2500 g C m−2, whereas the oat–canola–oat and hay–oat–fallow fields had only about 1400 g C m−2. The perennial field had the advantage of both early- and late-season growth when crops were absent on the other fields. The hay and hay–oat–fallow fields had comparable cumulative ecosystem respiration (1400 g C m−2). Manure additions contributed 300 g C m−2 on the two converted fields.

In France, a breeding bird survey is running since 1989 and offers keen birdwatchers to count spring birds annually during 5 min exactly on 10 fix points within a randomly selected square. The first goal of such breeding bird surveys is to measure temporal trends in order to detect possible species declines. Combining annual indices of species sharing ecological affinities or a protected/red list status further provides biodiversity indicators for policy makers. Because the sampling effort is similar among sites, and because the initial selection of monitored sites is random, the temporal trends can be considered representative of national trends, and spatial comparisons of the obtained metrics are possible. Species abundance, community richness but also community specialization and average trophic level can be estimated for each site and each year and further related to the wide range of habitat and landscape characteristics and to agricultural or forestry practices. The large number of sites allows overcoming the opposition between adaptive and passive monitoring, making such schemes fitted to adaptive monitoring. This provides opportunities to determine which type of management or practices favour biodiversity. The comparison of population fate or community dynamics across a wide range of climates and temperatures, e.g. from southern to northern Europe, revealed how European birds are already affected by climate change. Bird communities are shifting northwards, but at a slower rate than temperatures, while bird populations have larger growth rates away from their hot thermal limit. Finally, such large-scale long-term monitoring data on a complete taxonomic group (Aves) is original and offers the opportunity to compare different measures of biological diversity, such as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Such a citizen science scheme is an efficient scientific tool (numerous papers published in international peer-reviewed journals) which is furthermore highly cost-effective, with a reduced permanent staff in a state insitution coordonating the network and analysing the data, while a similar survey conducted by state staff only would cost more than one million euros annually. The future development of bio-economic dynamic models for providing scenarios of sustainable farming and logging to maintain biodiversity will further highlight the necessity of such volunteer monitoring for policy makers and decision planning. Scientific and logistic partnerships could be proposed to help developing such a monitoring scheme in China.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:44:52","2012-12-20","58-66","","0","44","","Acta Oecologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ZSXCXJW4/jiguet_french_2012.pdf","","review","Agriculture; Breeding bird survey; Climate change; Diversity pattern; Global change; Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2007) make a distinction between ""citizen science"" and ""participatory action research"" based on spatial scale, and it appears that the former is defined as the ""use of citizens"" by scientists. Cooper et al. (2007) also discuss the implicit contract that the scientists need to provide results back to the citizens. It must be pointed out that using a distributed network of data gatherers is not new and was perhaps at its height in the collection era. Field collectors indeed submitted their specimens to centralizing influences such as wealthy collectors or museums. These agencies were able to observe patterns and produce treatises in ways that the individual field collectors could not. This difference naturally produced conflict. An early example may be seen in this plaint by Brian Hodgson, a naturalist in India who sent specimens back to Britain: ""Whilst the face of our land is darkened with skin hunters, deputed by learned Societies to encumber science with ill-ascertained species, no English zoological association has a single travelling naturalist (...) nor has one such body yet sought to invigorate local research"" (Hodgson 1873 quoted in Johnson 2005). Citizen science should ideally move away from using citizens on unequal terms and toward treating citizens as scientists on equal terms. Indeed, if anything, acts of information centralization should embrace the concepts of open access and freedom, allowing all to conduct science (Shyamal 2007). Data compilers should make use of centralized data to produce scientific results in exactly the same way as anyone else should be allowed. After all, science should be verifiable and repeatable.","2007","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","2","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/JZVEQ6JI/lakshminarayanan_using_2007.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report on evidence for Holocene-age, silt-dominated deposits found in kettle bottoms, which we interpret as loess. These silty deposits contrast with the broader interlobate landscape, which is composed of glaciofluvial materials dominated by medium and fine sands (125–500 μm). The abrupt lateral edges of the silty deposits, and their unique textural properties relative to the surrounding landscape, suggest that the silts were not washed from kettle backslopes. Rather, we suggest that the silts originated as loess that was episodically deposited in kettle bottoms across the Upland. Later, loess that may have been deposited on backslopes was occasionally redeposited into the centers of vegetated kettles, along with some background sands, by wind and water. Evidence in support of our conclusions includes (1) the fine-silty textural characteristics of the sediments, set within an otherwise sand-dominated landscape, (2) depositional sequences of charcoal-rich paleosols, intercalated within the otherwise “clean” kettle bottom silts, pointing to episodes of loess deposition interspersed with periods of slope stability and pedogenesis, and (3) increased silt contents within the upper meter of sandy soils on nearby stable uplands. Radiocarbon ages on bulk charcoal from nine paleosols within the kettle-bottom silt deposits fall mainly within the early Holocene. These deposits and 14C ages provide the first evidence of Holocene loess in the Great Lakes region, some of which probably originated from the nearby Muskegon River floodplain.","November 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:53","2014-09-21 02:41:53","","215-228","","2","3","","Aeolian Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Charcoal; Kettles; Loess; Paleosols; Radiocarbon dating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plants of four hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodondactylon L. × Cynodontransvaalensis L.)

Turf quality and leaf relative water content (RWC) decreased while electrolyte leakage (EL) increased during whole-plant drought stress for all genotypes, with more pronounced changes in each parameter for ‘C299’ and ‘Tifeagle’ than those for other genotypes (‘Tifway’, ‘Kan 1’, ‘Sportbermuda’, ‘H10’, and H19’), suggesting that the former two genotypes were more sensitive to drought stress than the other genotypes.

Immunoblotting analysis indicated that no dehydrin polypeptides were detected in all genotypes under well-watered conditions. A 24-kDa polypeptide was detected in ‘C299’ at 6 d of drought, but not in the other genotypes. The dehydrin polypeptides of about 14–74 kDa accumulated at 10 d of drought stress and in a range of RWL for detached leaves, and two dehydrins (31 and 40 kDa) exhibited differential accumulation in the drought-sensitive ‘C299’ and tolerant ‘Tifway’, as demonstrated by the whole-plant drought responses. The 31-kDa dehydrin polypeptide was present only in ‘Tifway’ and ‘H19’ at 10 d of drought stress, and accumulated with the increasing RWL in detached leaves of ‘Tifway’. The expression level of 40-kDa dehydrin polypeptides was greater in ‘Tifway’’ than in ‘C299’ at the same level of water deficit (from 10% to 65% RWL). These results indicated that the accumulation of 31- and 40-kDa dehydrins may contribute to drought or dehydration tolerance in warm-season bermudagrass.","January 15, 2010","2014-09-21 02:41:44","2014-09-21 02:41:44","","103-109","","2","167","","Journal of Plant Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bermudagrass; Dehydrin; Drought tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, intermediate wheatgrass is currently being domesticated as a perennial grain crop. However, the genetic information for molecular breeding is quite limited. Here we report a molecular analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in intermediate wheatgrass using gene cloning and protein biochemistry. Five HMW-GS genes were isolated from individual intermediate wheatgrass plants: two x-type genes TiHGS1 and TiHGS4, and three y-type genes TiHGS2, TiHGS3 and TiHGS5. Among them, TiHGS5 was novel and possessed an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminal domain or repetitive domain. Sequence alignments showed that TiHGS1 and TiHGS2 genes shared high identities (&gt;96%) with the Glu-1Dx and Glu-1Dy genes, respectively, in common wheat and Aegilops species, TiHGS3 with HMW-GS genes from Dasypyrum or Pseudoroegneria, and TiHGS4 and TiHGS5 with HMW-GS genes from Thinopyrum elongatum. This work provides substantial new insights into the gene compositions and protein profiles of HMW-GS in intermediate wheatgrass, and also gives evidence about the genome components of intermediate wheatgrass.","March 2014","2014-09-21 02:39:53","2014-09-21 02:39:53","","203-210","","2","59","","Journal of Cereal Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits; Intermediate wheatgrass; Sub-genomes; Thinopyrum intermedium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review explores the function of existing European nutrient risk analysis methodologies applied to two vitamins, niacin and folate, and two minerals, selenium and fluoride. A major weakness of existing models is their exclusive focus on a single, most sensitive adverse effect on the most susceptible sub-population. Analysis of the four nutrients revealed, paradoxically, that dosages that induce risks in sensitive populations commonly overlap with those which induce benefits in the majority. This situation appears to be the norm, rather than the exception. Such overlaps are exacerbated when risk evaluations fail to consider differences between molecular forms of the same nutrient. A new conceptual risk/benefit model is proposed to replace the over-simplified two-tail risk model that has been widely accepted by regulatory authorities in Europe and the USA in recent years. This new model, which reveals pertinent zones of overlap between risks and benefits, demonstrates that statutory limitation of dosages at levels beneath existing tolerable upper levels would in many cases prevent the majority of the population from experiencing benefits from higher dosages. Accordingly, it is proposed that a critical zone of risk/benefit analysis is established for dosages in excess of the upper level to facilitate policy and risk management decision-making. Conventional risk assessment on fluoride as undertaken by European and US authorities is explored in detail, and it is shown that risk management, if applied by public authorities in a manner which is consistent with that used for other nutrients, would make public drinking water fluoridation programmes unfeasible in light of dental fluorosis risk to children. Possible explanations for the common overlap in dosages which induce both beneficial and adverse effects are given, both at a population and individual level. The review concludes by proposing that statutory restriction of vitamin and mineral food supplement dosages should be delayed in the EU until validated and more scientifically rational methodologies are developed. Where significant health benefits are known to result from habitual or short-term ingestion of dosages in excess of either upper levels or proposed statutory ‘maximum levels’, risk/benefit analysis should be undertaken to allow re-evaluation of risk management strategies.","November 28, 2010","2014-09-21 02:41:00","2014-09-21 02:41:00","","27-38","","1","278","","Toxicology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fluoride; Folate; Food supplement; Model; Overlap; Risk–benefit analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During 1994, spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Alexis) was grown in a strip-split-plot experimental design to determine the effects that the main plot Ca treatments [A: Ambient at 370 μmol (CO2) mol−1; E: Enriched with free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) at ∼550 μmol (CO2) mol−1] had on several gas exchange properties of fully expanded sunlit primary leaves. The interacting strip-split-plot irrigation treatments were Dry or Wet [50% (D) or 100% (W) replacement of potential evapotranspiration] at ample nitrogen (261 kg N ha−1) and phosphorous (29 kg P ha−1) fertility. Elevated Ca facilitated drought avoidance by reducing stomatal conductance (gs) by 34% that conserved water and enabled stomata to remain open for a longer period into a drought. This resulted in a 28% reduction in drought-induced midafternoon depression in net assimilation rate (A). Elevated Ca increased A by 37% under Dry and 23% under Wet. Any reduction in A under Wet conditions occurred because of nonstomatal limitations, whereas under Dry it occurred because of stomatal limitations. Elevated Ca increased the diurnal integral of A (A′) that resulted in an increase in the seasonal-long integral of A′ (A″) for barley leaves by 12% (P = 0.14) under both Dry and Wet – 650, 730, 905 and 1020 ± 65 g (C) m−2 y−1 for AD, ED, AW and EW treatments, respectively. Elevated Ca increased season-long average dry weight (DWS; crown, shoots) by 14% (P = 0.02), whereas deficit irrigation reduced DWS by 7% (P = 0.06), although these values may have been affected by a short but severe pea aphid [Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)] infestation. Hence, an elevated-Ca-based improvement in gas exchange properties enhanced growth of a barley crop.","November 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:54","2014-09-21 02:40:54","","390-404","","1","144","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon dioxide; Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE); Global climate change; Growth; Net assimilation rate; stomatal conductance; Water relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifteen growing crossbred heifers (JerseyxRed Sindhi) of between 7-10 months age and pre-trial average body weight of 49-50 kg were divided on the basis of weight in to three treatment groups viz. T-1-hybrid sorghum+soybean, T-2-setaria+soybean and T-3-hybrid napier+soybean in a completely randomized block design. Intercropped forages were harvested fresh, chaffed and mixed before they were offered to the heifers. Chemical composition of the herbage, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight gain and nutrient digestibility co-efficients were estimated. The herbage mixtures had crude protein (CP) content in the range of 11.87 to 13.86% and ether extract (EE) contents were 2.91 to 3.11%, respectively. The herbage mixtures were rich in minerals (ash). The gross energy (kcal/g DM) was higher in hybrid napier+soybean, while hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had lower value for gross energy. The hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had higher contents of NDF, ADF, cellulose, lignin and silica as compared to that of hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. The heifers fed hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture had significantly (p<0.05) higher DMI g/kg W-0.75 (97.41 +/- 4.34) as compared to hybrid sorghum+soybean (88.31 +/- 2.66) and setaria+soybean (79.29 +/- 1.06) herbage mixtures. Nutrients digestibility, DCP percent, DCP intake and nitrogen balance were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the heifers fed on hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. There was a significant (p<0.05) difference among different herbage mixtures in TDN. The heifers on setaria+soybean herbage mixture had lower average body weight gain (g/day) than those on hybrid sorghum+soybean and hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixtures. Data obtained in this experiment demonstrated that herbage mixture of hybrid napier+soybean was better than hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures in the nutrition of growing heifers. It had highest nutritive value, batter digestibility co-efficients which showed better growth rate and higher feed efficiency. In ranking, hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture was better followed by hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean in nutritive value in the parameters studied. For future wasteland development program in humid-sub tropics of Himachal Pradesh hybrid napier and its intercropping with soybean is recommended for general adoption because of its better adaptability and higher nutritive value.","December 2002","2015-06-01 16:22:23","2015-06-01 16:22:23","","1754-1759","","12","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cattle; chemical composition; digestibility; DMI; Feed efficiency; growth rate; Intercropping; perennial grasses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of these habitats depend on flows of fresh and brackish water from the U.S. and Mexico. Up to now, these flows were the incidental result of water management actions taken to provide water for agriculture and municipal use, protect against flooding, and dispose of saline agricultural return flows. This paper briefly describes the wetlands and documents recent bi-national efforts to provide environmental flows to the delta, codified in Minutes 306, 316 and 319 of the water treaty between the U.S. and Mexico for the utilization of Colorado River water. Providing water for environmental uses in this watershed will be a daunting task given the many competing uses for water and expected diminished flows due to climate change. The paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of Ecological Engineering, Wetlands of the Colorado River Delta, which contributes 17 new research articles to the science based on these diverse aquatic habitats.

"R9HXNQAC","encyclopediaArticle","2014","","Co-citation","Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","","","","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Co-citation&oldid=619191869","Co-citation, like Bibliographic Coupling, is a semantic similarity measure for documents that makes use of citation relationships. Co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together by other documents. If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength, and the more likely they are semantically related. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of co-citation and a more recent variation of co-citation which accounts for the placement of citations in the full text of documents. The figure's left image shows the Documents A and B, which are both cited by Documents C, D and E; thus Documents A and B have a co-citation strength, or co-citation index of three. This score is usually established using citation indexes. Documents featuring high numbers of co-citations are regarded as more similar. The figure's right image shows a citing document which cites the Documents 1, 2 and 3. Both the Documents 1 and 2 and the Documents 2 and 3 have a co-citation strength of one, given that they are cited together by exactly one other document. However, Documents 2 and 3 are cited in much closer proximity to each other in the citing document compared to Document 1. To make co-citation a more meaningful measure in this case, a Co-Citation Proximity Index (CPI) can be introduced to account for the placement of citations relative to each other. Documents co-cited at greater relative distances in the full text receive lower CPI values. Gipp and Beel were the first to propose using modified co-citation weights based on proximity. Henry Small and Irina Marshakova are credited for introducing co-citation analysis in 1973. Both researchers came up with the measure independently, although Marshakova gained less credit, likely because her work was published in Russian. Co-citation analysis provides a forward-looking assessment on document similarity in contrast to Bibliographic Coupling, which is retrospective. The citations a paper receives in the future depend on the evolution of an academic field, thus co-citation frequencies can still change. In the to the right, for example, Doc A and Doc B may still be co-cited by future documents, say Doc F and Doc G. This characteristic of co-citation allows for a dynamic document classification system when compared to Bibliographic Coupling. Over the decades, researchers proposed variants or enhancements to the original co-citation concept. Howard White introduced author co-citation analysis in 1981. Gipp and Beel proposed Co-citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) and introduced the CPI as an enhancement to the original co-citation concept in 2009. Co-citation Proximity Analysis considers the proximity of citations within the full-texts for similarity computation and therefore allows for a more fine-grained assessment of semantic document similarity using co-citation.","2014-07-30T21:06:08Z","2015-04-20 13:03:04","2015-04-20 13:03:04","2015-04-20 13:03:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 619191869","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/Z34U93WS/Co-citation.html","","Bibliographic network mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four main approaches have been applied in bird monitoring: comparing distribution atlases from different times, repeated monitoring programmes, checklist programmes, and species-specific surveys. We evaluate the potential of another type of data for monitoring: presence-only data on species sightings reported voluntarily by the public to open-access internet platforms, here the Species Gateway (SG) in Sweden. We regressed data on the 242 bird species observed 2001–2009 in the Swedish Bird Survey (SBS) against the corresponding SG data. We also investigated the relationship for groups of species utilizing different habitats and displaying a significant inter-annual variation, a coefficient of variation &gt;0.3 according to the SBS. We found support for a positive relationship in inter-annual variation in population level between the two datasets. However, the species subsets displayed variation from positive to negative correlations. Restricting the analysis to species with high inter-annual variation increased the positive correlation between the data sets. The reason for the mismatch between the two datasets may be explained by temporal changes in the willingness to report certain common species to the SG. Another reason may be an imbalance in the coverage of common versus uncommon species among the two datasets. The use of voluntary citizen-based data requires great care and good knowledge of the limitation of the data.

The top 25 emergent topics are identified for each year 2007 through 2010. These topics are classified and characterized in various ways in order to understand the motive forces behind their emergence, whether scientific discovery, technological innovation, or exogenous events. Topics are evaluated by searching for recent major awards associated with the topic or its key researchers.

In contrast, the interaction between SR and LS was marginally significant for the total yield and for the yield of supreme quality roots (3.8–5.1 cm diameter) but not for the recovery percentage of any of the root grades in RCC. A line spacing of 3.8 cm and SR of 22 seeds 30 cm−1 for Caro choice, and LS of 5.7 cm and SR of 18 seeds 30 cm−1 for RCC were optimal to obtain the highest total and supreme quality root yield, respectively.

Effects of agriculture on water quality and climate regulation are negative but improving; GHG emissions fell by 20% between 1990 and 2008. Recent declines in numbers of some farmland birds and in plant species richness have been halted, though not reversed. Enclosed Farmland provides considerable leisure and cultural value. Effective delivery of multiple ecosystem services requires improved understanding of how ecosystem services are generated, and of their economics and governance. Food production can be integrated with the delivery of other ecosystem services by promoting a diversity of farming systems and allocating land to different ecosystem services according to its suitability. Approaches include, minimising negative environmental impacts of food production through technology; mitigating environmental harm by managing areas for environmental benefit, from patches within fields to much larger areas; and developing markets and regulations for environmental protection.","February 15, 2013","2014-09-21 02:40:50","2014-09-21 02:40:50","","65-75","","0","166","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","External costs; Land sparing; Land use optimisation; Multifunctional; sustainable agriculture; Trade-offs; UK National Ecosystem Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ephemeral streams appear to lack such vertical layering or are characterized by weak layer development. Some of this may be due to the degree of mixing associated with the scour-and-fill process. However, continuous monitoring of bedload discharge in the Nahal Yatir in the northern Negev Desert reveals that sediment transport rates are extremely high so that the chance of armour layer development through selective non-entrainment is much reduced. Indeed, a comparison of the bedload and bed material size-distributions confirms a high degree of similarity and hints at equal mobility regardless of clast size. The monitoring programme also indicates that the bed becomes highly mobile at comparatively modest fluid shear, so that practically all floods are associated with high transport rates. Consequently, the winnowing that might be brought about by low transport-rate events does not occur. Even within a single event, winnowing is precluded by the rapid nature of flow recession that is so characteristic of flash-floods. The high degree of bed material mobility is attributable, in part, to the lack of strength that would otherwise be a corollary of armour development. However, it also highlights the divergent nature of the feedback loops that govern the relationship between flow and channel deposit in ephemeral and perennial systems.","July 1994","2014-09-21 02:41:23","2014-09-21 02:41:23","","353-363","","1–4","159","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, other potential causes were not excluded. The rapid decline in House Finches following the emergence of a new disease (mycoplasmal conjunctivitis) caused by a novel strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) in 1994 has provided a natural experiment and an opportunity to revisit the hypothesis that interspecific competition from House Finches drives population changes in House Sparrows. If true, the recent decline in House Finches should lead to an increase in House Sparrows. In this paper we test the hypothesis that House Sparrow and House Finch numbers in the northeastern United States vary inversely by examining data from three independent volunteer programs that monitor bird species' abundance and distribution (Christmas Bird Count, Project FeederWatch, and Breeding Bird Survey). In the first analysis we found that House Sparrow and House Finch numbers varied inversely during a time interval when House Finches were increasing and a time interval when House Finches were decreasing. In the second analysis, we found that the rates of geometric change in House Sparrow abundance (ln[HOSPt+1/HOSPt]) were negatively correlated with initial House Finch (HOFIt) and sparrow (HOSPt) abundances at individual sites, irrespective of the time period. Given that finch range expansion and subsequent declines in abundance are the result of two very different phenomena, it would be very unlikely for apparent competition or spurious correlations to cause the observed concomitant changes in House Sparrow abundance. We conclude that interspecific competition exists between these two species.","2007-04-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","864-870","","4","88","","Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/SDFAWP8T/cooper_contrasting_2007.pdf","","","Carpodacus mexicanus76; Citizen Science77; exotic species78; House Finch79; House Sparrow80; interspecific competition81; invasive species82; mycoplasmal conjunctivitis83; Passer domesticus84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field experiments were conducted in 2001 and 2002 to evaluate the effect of seeding date (24 May and 8 June) and location (Truro and Canning, Nova Scotia) on yield and essential oil quality of coriander cultivars ‘Jantar’ and ‘Alekseevski’. Plants grew well and had normal to high seed essential oil content. However, seed and essential oil yields were low, suggesting that the crop would not compete well for a place in Atlantic Canada agriculture. In both years, the earlier seeding date (24 May) enhanced productivity. The two cultivars had dissimilar oil content, oil and seed yields. The oil composition of tested cultivars was similar to coriander oils from India and Hungary with linalool as the main component. Hence, essential oil produced in Atlantic Canada should be easily marketed as are the essential oils produced in India and Hungary. Coriander seeds produced in Atlantic Canada contained normal to high amount of linalool (64–84.6%). The other oil constituents were camphor (3.4–6.2%), α-pinene (1.2–3.2%), phellandrene (1.7–4.1%), linalyl acetate (2.4–3.3%), limonene (0.7–1.8%), para-cymene (0.5–1.3%), and geranyl acetate (0.9–1.6).

This study synthesizes concepts from environmental sociology and ecological sciences to derive three criteria to assess adaptive coupling of an SES: prevention orientation, spatial targeting and temporal targeting. We apply our criteria to the case of nitrogen pollution from agriculture in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and resulting hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. We analyzed the federal agricultural research and development portfolio to assess the character of investments in knowledge creation and how patterns of investment have changed over time. While superficial assessment of the data suggests that public spending on nitrogen relevant research constitutes a substantive response to the problem of Gulf hypoxia, disaggregating the data highlights an ineffectual response. Specifically, we find that spatial and temporal targeting of investment of socioeconomic resources in the MRB is poorly aligned with the nature of ecological risks confronting the region. In addition to this policy relevant result, our study highlights the importance of geographically referenced data and attention to relevant scales of analysis. Further, the paper demonstrates opportunities to advance concepts and empirical understanding of social–ecological coupling through interdisciplinary research on interfaces that mediate interactions in SES, for example publicly funded research aimed at agricultural practice and environmental conservation in the MRB.","May 2011","2014-09-21 02:41:56","2014-09-21 02:41:56","","530-539","","2","21","","Global Environmental Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coupled system; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi River; Public agricultural research; Social–ecological interface; Targeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the relation between site and group characteristics, data quality, data use, and perceived outcomes (education, social capital, and policy change). We found that group size and the degree to which citizen groups perform tasks on their own (rather than aided by professionals) positively correlated with the quality of data collected.

While one might expect that groups committed to collecting good-quality data would be more likely to use it, there was no relation between data quality and data use, and no relation between data quality and perceived outcomes. More data use was, however, correlated with a group’s feeling of connection to a network of engaged citizens and professionals. While VMM may hold promise for bringing citizens and scientists together to work on joint conservation agendas, our data illustrate that data quality does not correlate with a volunteer group’s desire to use their data to promote regulatory change.

Using program MARK, we modeled the effects of species, urbanization at multiple spatial scales (canopy cover and impervious surface), and observer (citizen vs. scientist) on nest survival of four open-cup and one cavity-nesting species. In addition, artificial nests were used to determine the relative impacts of specific predators along the land-use gradient. Our results suggest that predation on nests within the land-use matrix declines with urbanization but that there are species-specific differences. Moreover, variation in nest survival among species was best explained by urbanization metrics measured at larger “neighborhood” spatial scales (e.g., 1000 m). Trends were supported by data from artificial nests and suggest that variable predator communities (avian vs. mammalian) are one possible mechanism to explain differential nest survival. In addition, we assessed the quality of citizen science data and show that citizens had no negative effect on nest survival and provided estimates of nest survival comparable to Smithsonian biologists. Although birds nesting within the urban matrix experienced higher nest survival, individuals also faced a multitude of other challenges such as contaminants and invasive species, all of which could reduce adult survival.","2010-03-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","419-426","","2","20","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/TETNPIDM/ryder_quantifying_2010.pdf","","","artificial nests77; citizen science78; land-use matrix79; MARK80; nest survival81; predation pressure82; urbanization83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chickweed, horseweed, dandelion, and henbit were considered the most problematic winter annual weeds statewide. However, no weed species was listed by more than 41% of farmers statewide suggesting that relatively unique weed management problems may exist on many farms. Also, the perceived importance of most weed species varied substantially among Indiana's nine districts. For example, velvetleaf was not listed as a problematic weed by any farmers in three districts. Burcucumber was not considered a statewide problem but was listed among the top three weeds by 14 and 16% of farmers in two southern districts.

Interpretation of the resulting data to estimate population trends is plagued with problems, including teasing apart genuine population trends from variations in observation effort. We devised a way to correct for annual variation in effort when estimating trends in occupancy (species distribution) from faunal or floral databases of opportunistic observations. First, for all surveyed sites, detection histories (i.e., strings of detection–nondetection records) are generated. Within-season replicate surveys provide information on the detectability of an occupied site. Detectability directly represents observation effort; hence, estimating detectablity means correcting for observation effort. Second, site-occupancy models are applied directly to the detection-history data set (i.e., without aggregation by site and year) to estimate detectability and species distribution (occupancy, i.e., the true proportion of sites where a species occurs). Site-occupancy models also provide unbiased estimators of components of distributional change (i.e., colonization and extinction rates). We illustrate our method with data from a large citizen-science project in Switzerland in which field ornithologists record opportunistic observations. We analyzed data collected on four species: the widespread Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) and Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the scarce Rock Thrush (Monticola saxatilis) and Wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria). Our method requires that all observed species are recorded. Detectability was <1 and varied over the years. Simulations suggested some robustness, but we advocate recording complete species lists (checklists), rather than recording individual records of single species. The representation of observation effort with its effect on detectability provides a solution to the problem of differences in effort encountered when extracting trend information from haphazard observations. We expect our method is widely applicable for global biodiversity monitoring and modeling of species distributions.","2010","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1388–1397","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","en","©2010 Society for Conservation Biology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ZZ4XHMIF/kery_site-occupancy_2010.pdf","","","ciencia ciudadana; distribución; lista de control; modelo de distribución de especies; modelo de ocupación de sitios; monitoreo; monitoreo de biodiversidad; tendencia poblacional; WinBUGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies are being used to sequence complete genomes of model organisms; however, this resource has not been fully used for species identifications. Animal researchers commonly use one mitochondrial region, and groups of plant scientists have proposed numerous combinations of two or three chloroplast markers as genomic identifiers. Yet, nearly as many studies have reported that the proposed regions are uninformative in some plant groups and at various taxonomic levels. • Methods: We propose a combination of whole (or nearly whole) chloroplast genomes, mitochondrial genes, and nuclear repeat regions for both species identifications and phylogenetic analyses, obtained from a simple total DNA extraction and one run on massively parallel DNA sequencing machines. • Key results: We have recovered both coding and noncoding sequences from multiple genetic sources, providing genomic information for comparisons within and between multiple taxonomic levels. • Conclusions: In combination with morphological and other data, this abundance of genomic information will have a broad range of applications, including not only helping conservation biologists understand ecosystem biodiversity, but also understanding the evolutionary histories of organisms, mending damaged landscapes, and investigating interactions of plants with pollinators and pests.","2011-03-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","415-425","","3","98","","Am.

Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity–stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.","June 1, 2006","2015-04-05 17:56:17","2015-04-05 17:56:17","2015-04-05 17:56:17","629-632","","7093","441","","Nature","","","","","","","","","© 2006 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/FCS56JAU/tilman_biodiversity_2006.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Varying application rates are considered with a range of dry matter contents, buffering capacities, and water-soluble carbohydrate contents for both alfalfa and ryegrass. The results indicate that final silage pH can be either increased or decreased by formic acid addition depending on application rate, crop dry matter content, and other parameters. Final silage pH is decreased by molasses only when the water-soluble carbohydrate content is low enough to inhibit the extent of fermentation. Formic acid is predicted to reduce substantially the extent of proteolysis in silage, while molasses has little or no effect. Both formic acid and molasses reduce the range of conditions resulting in clostridial spoilage, but formic acid ensures a lactate silage with greater certainty.","May 1988","2014-09-21 02:42:15","2014-09-21 02:42:15","","1220-1231","","5","71","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, if citizen science data are to be used by local communities, research is needed to determine which factors contribute to local community member trust in citizen science data, and how to increase the benefits and use of citizen science programs. This article describes the Groundwater Education Through Water Evaluation & Testing (GET WET!) program that employs middle and high school students, state and local government employees, environmental nongovernmental organization leaders, business representatives, college faculty and students, and other volunteers as citizen scientists to create a database of groundwater quality for use as a baseline for local water resources management. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews pre- and post-involvement from 40 participants in this citizen science program conducted in five states in the northeastern United States. Results indicate that factors of trust are largely based on interpersonal trust and familiarity. We conclude with recommendations and future research that may improve local community member willingness to trust citizen science data generated by students.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1032–1040","","5","48","","","Trust in citizen science research","","","","","","","en","© 2012 American Water Resources Association.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/UW798FDK/thornton_trust_2012.pdf","","","Citizen science; drinking water; k-12 students; trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, longer-term development policy perspectives on the one hand, and shorter-term food-relief considerations on the other, often conflict. This paper illuminates the policy conflicts which arise when local-level research and development initiatives interface with the effects of macro-policy-initiated changes and safety-net interventions. Using a participatory agricultural research project in Eastern Kenya as a case study, the paper describes specific household food-security problem diagnosis and a range of research interventions planned within a more sustainable rural livelihoods framework. Working with local farmers, the project implemented a range of applied research and linked development interventions that showed promise in easing food security through a broadening of the livelihood base. Some of these initiatives were carried further through the local farmers' own initiative. The conclusion is that semi-arid areas, despite views that see these as low-potential and obvious safety-net candidates, often have potential for agricultural intensification and increased productivity. However, to ensure that research results are utilised and farmers have access to new technology and markets, there is a need for external or public-sector support to integrated longer-term development initiatives. This may require rethinking the scope of research and development approaches, particularly removing unhelpful boundaries between research, extension and development functions, and increasing farmer participation in the whole process—if possible as part of a less centralised and more household-oriented approach to food-security policy and strategy.","August 1999","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","363-390","","4","24","","Food Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adaptive research; Farmer participation; Household food security; Semi-arid; Structural adjustment programmes; Sustainable rural livelihoods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Throughout the last 500 years many species from the Mediterranean basin have been transferred either accidentally or deliberately to the new-world, and integrated into a multitude of farming systems. During the past 30 years biological, economic and environmental forces have caused failure/breakdown of some of these productive systems. This paper examines the factors influencing legume usage in Mediterranean agriculture and uses the changing focus on legumes in southern Australia to illustrate new roles for legumes in evolving farming systems. An essential factor in developing new roles for legumes is the matching of root-nodule bacteria to both legume hosts and soil conditions. New roles for annual and perennial pastures in Mediterranean-type agriculture are discussed in relation to an analysis of the role of root-nodule bacteria in maximising productivity in these systems.","March 2000","2014-09-21 02:41:06","2014-09-21 02:41:06","","107-122","","2–3","65","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Farming systems; Ley-farming; Pasture; Pulse; Rhizobium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technologies must be effective within farmer resource constraints, increase food production, reduce risk and enhance the soil fertility. Results from on-farm participatory research were used to quantify the effects of agronomic practices on soil resources. Agricultural productivity is primarily nitrogen (N) limited throughout Malawi, and sub-humid Zimbabwe. Tightening economic constraints faced by farmers in the region have reduced inorganic fertilizer inputs and necessitate increased reliance on biologically-fixed N and N cycling. Three components of organic matter technology were evaluated: (1) the effects of residue quality; (2) the role of deep rooting systems; and (3) tradeoffs between legumes grown for grain versus soil regeneration. Perennial systems investigated include improved fallows, intercropping, and biomass transfer. Annual systems include intercrops and rotations of cereals with legumes. The most promising non-food legumes were Tephrosia and Sesbania. Interestingly, high quality residues of perennial legumes were most effective at supplying N in the short to medium term, whereas low quality residues immobilised N. Low quality residues were problematic for smallholder farmers who need immediately available N. Challenges to adoption of perennial system technologies include establishment costs, resource competition and delayed benefits. Farmer adoption of annual grain legumes is promoted by the simultaneous production of food; however, those species which have a high N harvest index add little to no net N to the soil. Species that combine some grain yield with high root and leaf biomass, thus a low N harvest offer a useful compromise of meeting farmer food security concerns and improving soil fertility. Promising genotypes include Arachis, Cajanus, Dolichos and Mucuna spp. On-farm N budgets indicate that legumes with high quality residues and deep root systems are effective ways at improving nutrient cycling. Areas of future research priority for smallholder farms in southern Africa were identified, including technologies which combine inorganic and organic fertilizer and improve legume growth and establishment on degraded soils.","December 1, 1998","2014-09-21 02:40:23","2014-09-21 02:40:23","","185-200","","1–3","71","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroforestry; Grain legumes; Residue quality; Soil fertility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study demonstrates that heuweltjies and livestock grazing act together to shape vegetation patterns in the region. Using a multifactorial approach, we investigated the combined effects of heuweltjie-induced habitat conditions, grazing pressure and physical disturbance by livestock and native animals as well as the interactions among two distinct plant functional groups, on the composition and cover of vascular plant vegetation. Heuweltjie soils had significantly higher pH-values, finer texture, and higher concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus than those of the surroundings. Neither perennial nor ephemeral cover was different on- and off-mounds. However, species richness, cover of highly palatable plants and livestock grazing pressure were significantly higher between mounds. Grazing pressure generally resulted in a loss of perennial species and a shift to more ephemeral species, probably through the competitive release of annuals and geophytes from perennial plants. We propose that the apparent contradiction between superior nutrient conditions and inferior plant food quality on heuweltjies is caused by a combination of otherwise unfavourable soil properties and historic overgrazing of heuweltjies resulting in local degradation of the vegetation.","December 2012","2014-09-21 02:40:45","2014-09-21 02:40:45","","198-205","","0","87","","Journal of Arid Environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem engineering; General Linear Model; Heuweltjies; Palatability; Succulent Karoo; Utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Broadbalk plots feature annual wheat and have been in continuous production since 1843, while the Park Grass plots feature perennial grassland vegetation that has been hayed every year since 1856. To evaluate the long-term effects of annual versus perennial vegetation on soil P forms, we carried out Hedley P fractionations and microbial biomass-P fumigation-extraction analyses on soils from fertilized and unfertilized treatments of both experiments. In both P-fertilized and unfertilized soils we found an inverse relationship between pool sizes of actively cycling Po (0.5 M bicarbonate + 0.1 M NaOH fractions) and recalcitrant Pi (hot conc. HCl + final digest fractions) with Po dominant in the perennial hay meadow and recalcitrant Pi dominant in the annual wheat. Microbial biomass-P in the surface horizons of fertilized and unfertilized perennial hay meadow was an order of magnitude greater than in annual wheat. To investigate how P fractions changed through time we conducted Hedley P fractionations on archived soils sampled from Broadbalk wheat in 1893, and Park Grass hay meadow in 1876. Since 1893, unfertilized Broadbalk soils experienced almost no change in P fractions in the surface 23 cm, but substantial depletion in labile and recalcitrant Pi and Po in deeper strata. The Park Grass perennial vegetation showed greater depletion of surface soil fractions over time. When fertilized for over 100 years, almost all P fractions in the surface 23 cm were enriched in both crop types, but below 70 cm, only the active Po pool in Park Grass showed a substantial increase under fertilization. Even when fertilized, low available or occluded Pi fractions in both annual and perennial systems were substantially depleted below 70 cm. Our findings suggest that herbaceous perennials maintain a greater proportion of native or fertilizer-P in relatively available organic forms compared to annual wheat.

Models are fitted to the observed data, which include a spatial mixture of soil (not covered by ice) and CO2 frost (with a specific grain size and a small amount of included dust and H2O ice). Two different kinds of spectra were observed: those over the permanent polar cap with almost pure CO2 ice, negligible water ice, no soil fraction required, and bright; and those over mixed terrain (at the edge of the cap or near troughs) containing a significant soil spatial fraction, more water ice and smaller CO2 grain size. The amount of water ice given by fits to scaled albedo models is less than 10 ppm by weight. When using multi-stream reflectance models with the appropriate lighting geometry, the water amount must be 2–5 times greater than the albedo fit (less than 50 ppm).

Here, we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes. Previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations; two explanations for this pattern are that (1) migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats (i.e., migratory escape), and (2) long-distance migration weeds out infected animals (i.e., migratory culling). We combined field-sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms. Analysis of within-breeding-season variation in eastern North America showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape. Prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity, as indexed by larval density. Among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway, parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in Mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period. Collectively, these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations, with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations.","2010-07-19","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","342-351","","2","92","","Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/SJTMDBBH/bartel_monarch_2010.pdf","","","butterflies81; citizen science82; Danaus plexippus83; host–parasite dynamics84; infectious disease85; long-distance migration86; monarch butterfly87; Ophryocystis elektroscirrha88; protozoan parasites89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drivers influencing these fluctuations in abundance of M. alfredi at the site remain uncertain. Based on daily count, behavioural, weather and oceanographic data collected over a three-year period, this study examined the link between the relative number of sightings of manta rays at LEI, the biophysical environment, and the habitat use of individuals around the LEI reef using generalised additive models. The response variable in each of the three generalised additive models was number of sightings (per trip at sea) of cruising, cleaning or foraging M. alfredi. We used a set of eleven temporal, meteorological, biological, oceanographic and lunar predictor variables. Results for cruising, cleaning and foraging M. alfredi explained 27.5%, 32.8% and 36.3% of the deviance observed in the respective models and highlighted five predictors (year, day of year, wind speed, chlorophyll-a concentration and fraction of moon illuminated) as common influences to the three models. There were more manta rays at LEI in autumn and winter, slower wind speeds, higher productivity, and around the new and full moon. The winter peak in sightings of foraging M. alfredi was found to precede peaks in cleaning and cruising activity around the LEI reef, which suggests that enhanced food availability may be a principal driver for this seasonal aggregation. A spatial analysis of behavioural observations highlighted several sites around the LEI reef as ‘multi-purpose’ areas where cleaning and foraging activities commonly occur, while the southern end of the reef is primarily a foraging area. The use of extensive citizen science datasets, such as those collected by dive operators in this study, is encouraged as they can provide valuable insights into a species' ecology.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:43:22","2012-12-18 15:23:05","e46170","","10","7","","PLoS ONE","When giants turn up","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS ONE","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/QSUAH3ND/jaine_when_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server. We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying “crowd sourcing” techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70% of the alignment blocks considered. We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of “human-brain peta-flops” of computation that are spent every day playing games.

These, and most of the summer grain crops being developed in the region, are relatively recent additions to Australian agriculture, and in some cases to the tropics, or to mechanized agriculture in the tropics. Most are strongly sensitive to photoperiod and temperature. A primary aim, therefore, has necessarily been to improve their adaptation and subtropical environments characterized by generally warm temperatures and relatively short photoperiods. At the same time, constraints imposed by stressful temperature extremes, and frequent water-deficits as a result of limited and highly variable seasonal rainfall, have had to be addressed. The latter constraint has been compound by soils that often have limited water-storage capacity. Genetic improvement has been confounded by large and often nonsystematic genotype X environment (g×3) interaction, which increases the testing necessary as a basis for selection. The most valuable contribution of physiological understanding has been to interpretation of g×e interaction in terms of biological, as opposed to statistical, models. Physiological interpretations have been both qualitative and quantitative in nature, and ‘models’ range from simple to complex, but nonetheless enable predictive inference to be drawn of the performance of particular genotypes in specific environments. Physiological research is thus being used to identify the key physiological and climatic constraints to productivity confronting crop improvement, to establish strategies for agronomic and breeding research, and to formulate ‘dynamic’ ideotypes to assist the breeder to match crop life-cycles to the sources and constraints of target environments. Physiological understanding also offers the potential to exploit traits conferring resistance to specific stresses but, to date that potential remains largely unrealized.","April 1991","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","113-139","","2","26","","Field Crops Research","Crop improvement for tropical and subtropical Australia","Ideotypes and physiology: Tailoring plants for increased production","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews the studies that have tried to estimate the value of forest ecosystem services. Broadly, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What insights do these studies provide on the value of forest ecosystems? (2) What lessons do they offer from an economic and policy perspective? (3) What are the shortcomings of the existing studies, and what are the challenges and issues for future research? Evidence from a cross section of forest sites, countries and regions suggests that not only the total valuation of ecosystem services varies widely across studies but also the valuation of individual services. This variation suggests that policies to conserve ecosystems and their services should emphasise local contexts and values. This paper concludes by discussing the shortcomings of existing studies, and suggests that, among other things, future research should focus on the neglected ecosystem services, ‘disservices’, assess the role of dynamic factors and environmental catastrophes on the provision of ecosystem services, and assess the benefits of keeping forests intact versus converting them to alternative uses.","September 2013","2014-09-21 02:41:31","2014-09-21 02:41:31","","137-149","","0","93","","Ecological Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon sequestration; Economic valuation; Forest ecosystem services; Recreation benefits; Soil conservation; Watershed protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the lack of mineral fertilizer applications, the aboveground harvests of perennial fields yielded similar levels of N compared to those of conventional high-input wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields and at only 8% of the in-field energy costs. Their 75-yr cumulative N yield per ha was approximately 23% greater than that from the region's wheat fields. In terms of aboveground food webs, perennial fields harboured greater numbers and/or diversity of insect pollinators, herbivores and detritivores. Belowground, perennial grass fields maintained 43 Mg ha−1 more soil carbon and 4 Mg ha−1 more soil nitrogen than annual crop fields in the surface 1 m. Soil food webs in perennial fields, as indicated by nematode communities, exhibited greater food web complexity and stability than did those in annual crop fields.

For this study we examined gender patterns in a nature-based activity, observing wild birds, popular in two developed nations, the USA and UK. We collated data from several organizations and categorized data sources as representing activities that involve varying degrees of competitiveness and acting authoritatively. Patterns were consistent with the hypotheses that gender differences in preferred types of bird-related recreation reflected well documented gender-specific differences in preferences for competition and propensity to act authoritatively. Observing birds encompassed both a recreational hobby, “bird watching,” that was female biased in the USA, and a competitive sport, “birding,” that was heavily male biased among adults, but not youth, in both the USA and UK. Because of differences in gender participation in bird-related activities, fostering both competitive and noncompetitive bird-related activities is necessary to increase the likelihood of bringing larger segments of the population into nature-based recreation.","2010","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","4","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/CBK3FUPT/cooper_gender_2010.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Mexico, regional long-term bird monitoring has been undertaken only over the last decade. Two comprehensive programs have incorporated bird monitoring as the main tool for assessing the impact of human productive activities on birds and habitats at local and regional levels: the Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) and the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Mexico (CBMM). These programs are implemented in supremely important biodiverse regions in the southern and southeastern states of Mexico. Bird monitoring activities are based on the recruitment and participation of local people linked to sustainable productive projects promoted by the CBMM or IEM. Through a series of training workshops delivered by specialists, local monitors receive equipment and coordinate to become part of a large monitoring network that facilitates regional covertures. This data currently being obtained by local people will enable the mid- and long-term assessment of the impacts of sustainable human productive activities on birds and biodiversity. Community-based bird monitoring programs are a promising opportunity for enhancing scientific knowledge, improving sustainable practices, and supporting wildlife conservation in areas of high biodiversity.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:45:33","2012-12-20","1984-1998","","9","4","","","Birding for and with people","","","","","","","","","","","","CrossRef","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/TTA5EN4X/ortega-alvarez_birding_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little attention has been paid to assessing nutrient competition in the system. Seasonal changes in relative dry matter yield (RDY), relative nitrogen yield (RNY), relative phosphorus yield (RPY) and relative potassium yield (RKY) are useful indices to estimate the N, P and K status in intercropping system. The competitive effect of soybean (Glycine max L.) in association with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) was assessed using these indices under six nutrient treatments (0, 75% NPK, 100% NPK, 75% NPK + 5 Mg farmyard manure, 75% NPK + 5 Mg phosphocompost and 75% NPK + 1.5 Mg poultry manure) from a 5-year field experiment conducted in a N and P deficient Vertisol of Central India. The RDY and RNY of sorghum were greater than the values of RDY and RNY of soybean indicating inter-species competition for N between component crops, peak competition being at 80 days after sowing (DAS). Using the concept of RDY and RNY, it was observed that having coincided the maturity period and peak demand for N of both the crops, soil N was exhausted by sorghum because of its strong competitive ability and N was liming for soybean at 80 DAS. Strong competitive ability of sorghum was also evident from higher biomass, root mass, root length density and contribution to the mixture yield. Once sorghum entered its maturity phase, its competitive effect on soybean was greatly reduced. Competition for P between two species is more prominent up to 60 DAS and P was not limiting to none of the species after 60 DAS as the RPY values were equal to corresponding RDY values. Based on RKY value, none of the component species suffered from K deficiency at any stage even if it was not applied. This implied that competition exists for soil N and P but not for K up to 60–80 DAS in soybean/sorghum intercropping system. The result showed that competition between two crops measured in terms of RNY, RPY and RKY under organic-fertilizer was less; however, recorded higher soybean equivalent yield and monetary advantage index than inorganic-fertilizer. The study thus suggests that in soybean/sorghum intercropping system to minimize competition between two crops in N and P deficient Vertisol, application of 75% NPK + FYM/poultry manure/phosphocompost is a viable nutrient management option.","July 2009","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","43-50","","1","31","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Intercropping; Legume; Nutrient competition; Vertisol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is a short review of some of the dietary factors that can affect milk protein concentration and yield. Milk protein consists of a number of different components, the greatest of which is casein. This in the most important component for cheese and casein powder manufacture but, generally, nutritional manipulations do not significantly change the relative proportions of the different protein components. Increasing amino acid supply to the mammary gland is the basis for most dietary manipulations to increase milk protein concentration or yield. Protein level in the diet does not affect milk protein concentration. However the type of protein fed can have an effect and including fishmeal generally increases milk protein concentration and yield. Feeding higher levels of concentrate supplement, thereby increasing the plane of nutrition of the cow, increases both milk protein concentration and yield. While in theory it would be expected that feeding starchy ingredients would increase milk protein, this has not been shown clearly in experiments. The inclusion of high oil levels in the concentrate supplement tends to reduce milk protein concentration. Infusion of casein or essential amino acids post-ruminally increases milk protein concentration but the response to feeding rumen-protected lysine and methionine has been variable. Cows grazing clover swards have higher milk protein concentration and yield than those grazing perennial ryegrass swards. It is important for the farmer to try and increase milk protein concentration and yield using both nutritional and breeding strategies. It is likely that in the future milk protein will continue to become more valuable relative to the other components of milk as protein concentration is of great importance to the milk processor in the manufacture of a range of products.","May 1993","2014-09-21 02:41:22","2014-09-21 02:41:22","","117-134","","1–2","35","","Livestock Production Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Milk; Nutritional Manipulation; Protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed 11781 records (from 1988 to 2008) from 2 public recording databases operating in the UK. We describe 3 sightings hotspots: western Scotland, Isle of Man and southwest England, and highlight the marked seasonality of basking shark sightings, which were at their greatest during the northeast Atlantic summer (June to August). We further highlight a significant correlation between the duration of the sightings season in each year and the North Atlantic Oscillation, an atmosphere−ocean climate oscillation that has been linked to forcing of marine ecosystems. We augment patterns from public sightings records with effort-related data collected by boat-based transects at 2 regional sightings hotspots (western Scotland and southwest England). Analysis of reported body size data indicated that the annual proportion of small sharks (<4 m length) sighted by the public decreased, the proportion of medium-sized sharks sighted (4−6 m) increased, and the proportion of large sharks sighted (>6 m) remained constant. These patterns may be indicative of a population recovery following systematic harvesting in the 20th century.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:43:28","2012-12-20","121-134","","","459","","Mar Ecol Prog Ser","Basking sharks in the northeast Atlantic","","","","","","","","","","","","Inter-Research Science Center","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/JDIRG5IW/witt_basking_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, outbreaks of switchgrass anthracnose disease have been reported from the northeastern United States. Incidences of switchgrass anthracnose are known in North America since 1886 through herbarium specimens and disease reports, but the causal agent of this disease has never been experimentally determined or taxonomically evaluated. In the present work, we evaluate the causal agent of switchgrass anthracnose, a new species we describe as Colletotrichum navitas (navitas = Latin for energy). Multilocus molecular phylogenetics and morphological characters show C. navitas is a novel species in the falcate-spored graminicolous group of the genus Colletotrichum; it is most closely related to the corn anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola.

Oryza longistaminata is an undomesticated, perennial, rhizomatous relative of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Using five sets of 4 × 2 factorial mating designs, we crossed rhizomatous interspecific genotypes (IGs) from an intermated O. sativa/O. longistaminata population with male-fertile IG selections from the intermated population, and with O. sativa CVs. Parents and progeny were planted in an upland field at IRRI using a randomized complete block design and evaluated for rhizome expression, survival after 1 year, vigor of the survivors, and yield. For the IG parents, rhizome expression was variable and penetrance of most genotypes was incomplete, but genotypes that demonstrated the potential for moderate rhizome expression had high penetrance (89% average). The CV parents yielded 11.0 g/plant on average but none produced rhizomes or survived 1 year. The IG parents averaged yields of 3.1 g/plant, 57% rhizomatous and 36% survival. The IG/IG progeny averaged yields of 4.2 g/plant, 32% rhizomatous and 37% survival. The IG/CV progeny averaged yields of 6.0 g/plant, 18% rhizomatous and 16% survival. Nine IG/IG progeny and six IG/CV progeny were rhizomatous, perennial, and yielded at least 5 g/plant, and five of these yielded more than 10 g/plant. For the IG parents and IG/IG progeny, rhizome presence and expression were positively associated with survival and vigor of the survivors. General combining ability effects were significant for percent survival and yield but not percent rhizomatous. Specific combining ability effects were significant for percent rhizomatous, percent survival and yield. By selecting female parents for long rhizomes and male parents for fertility, considerable gains in rhizome expression, survival and yield were made. The development of perennial upland rice CVs should be feasible via introgression of genes from O. longistaminata.","January 8, 2006","2014-09-21 02:39:58","2014-09-21 02:39:58","","39-48","","1","95","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clonal performance; Fertility; Interspecific crosses; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; Rhizome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The internal structure of the bars was examined along trenches and in shallow pits. Gravel sheets and unit bars form during transporting flow events in the main channel, on intra-bar channels and near bar heads. Unit bars are dominated by the Go facies. Compound bars develop from accretion around, and modification of, unit bars. Compound bars are active under the current flow regime and the average depth of the fill layer is about 35 cm. The structure of compound bars is dominated by Gm (massive), containing large amounts of sand. The second most common facies is clast-supported, openwork, and well sorted sediments of the Go (pebbles) facies. Bar formation, and the development of the range of facies evident in the bars is controlled by sediment supply, particularly the high volumes of sand-sized sediment, the passage of gravel sheets and bedforms during floods, and the lateral and vertical instability of the channel. Repeated scour and fill events have produced a diverse arrangement of facies, with numerous erosional contacts between depositional units. Lateral and downstream shifts in the pattern of scour and fill due to flow and antecedent conditions shape the channel morphology and bar internal structure. Ephemeral river bars differ from those of humid and proglacial rivers in terms of the dominant facies present, the arrangement of the facies within the bars, and the sedimentary structures developed within the depositional units and on the bar surface.","November 15, 2009","2014-09-21 02:41:40","2014-09-21 02:41:40","","57-70","","1–4","221","","Sedimentary Geology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bar structure; Compound bars; River bed; Sediment transport; Unit bars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data presented are based upon experiments and observations in the field and in the laboratory. It was observed that the ice fringes are formed when the temperature falls to freezing point (o° C., 32° F.); but they are not a function of the hoar-frost which may be present upon the ground. The ice fringes do not form upon the side of a splinter which contains the pith or upon the line of fracture, but upon the outer woody surface. The formation of the ice fringe, however, is not a function of the surface condition of the stem. The stem is frequently found to be cracked, but usually no ice protrudes from the rifts. The growth of the ice fringe ceases when the ground is frozen to a depth of 2 to 3 cm., and when the moisture in the stem is frozen. The size of the ice fringes and the height to which they extend above the ground depend upon the rate of evaporation from the stem and upon the amount of moisture in the ground. Over 5 grammes of ice may be formed upon a single plant during a single night. Photographs are given of ice fringes formed upon stems which had been kept in the laboratory several months. They show that the ice may be formed upon stems without the roots. Hence the ice is not formed as a result of hydrostatic pressure exerted by the roots, which are perennial. All the observations are in agreement in showing that the moisture arises in the stem as the result of capillary attraction. The height (1 to 5 cm.) to which the moisture can rise within the stem is governed partly by the rate of evaporation from the surface. Microphotographs of thin sections of plants are given, which show the structure of stems of plants which do not form ice fringes; also microphotographs of sections of stems of plants which form ice fringes. It is shown that those plants which form ice fringes the most readily and in the greatest abundance have the most sap-tubes. The ice fringe is a composite of a number of very thin ribbons. In the laboratory the formation of the ice fringe was observed from its very beginning. The first stage in the production of the ice fringe consists of a single row of fine, hair-like filaments of ice. This row of ice filaments lengthens, up and down the stem. The filaments increase in number, thus forming a solid wedge-shaped tooth of ice, which constitutes the second stage of development. In the third stage of development the wedge-shaped tooth of ice widens and increases in length, as the result of freezing of the water which continues to soak out of the stem. There appears to be no difference between the formation of these ice fringes and the “ground ice” formed on wet soils, other than that in the latter a particle of gravel usually forms the nucleus to start the congelation. In both cases the moisture is brought to the surface by capillary action. When the rate of supply to the surface is more rapid than the loss by evaporation, and the air is at a sufficiently low temperature, ice is formed.","November 1914","2014-09-21 02:42:14","2014-09-21 02:42:14","","589-621","","5","178","","Journal of the Franklin Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines the profitability of commercial soybean production using a nationwide survey of soybean producers for 2006 that includes a targeted sample of organic growers. Treatment-effect models are specified to characterize adopters of the organic approach and to isolate the impact of organic choice on operating, operating and capital, and total economic costs of soybean production. Organic soybean producers tend to be younger, have less crop acreage, and are less likely to work off-farm than conventional producers. Organic soybean production costs range from about $1 to $6 per bushel higher than those for conventional soybeans due to both lower yields and higher per-acre costs, while the average organic price premium in 2006 was more than $9 per bushel. Long-term cropping systems data suggest significant returns to organic systems result from similar yields and lower costs than conventional systems, but the high returns to commercial organic production found in this study can only be attributed to the significant price premiums paid for organic soybeans. Average organic soybean price premiums have remained high since 2006 despite much higher conventional soybean prices as users of organic soybeans attempt to retain and attract more acreage. However, increases in conventional soybean prices and fuel prices reduce the incentive for planting organic soybeans by improving returns to conventional production and increasing the relative costs of organic production.

All these factors prompt a reexamination of the initial vision of Digital Earth, and a discussion of the major elements that should be part of a next generation.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:43:10","2012-12-18","11088-11094","","28","109","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/72MTVT5N/goodchild_next-generation_2012.pdf","","review","scientific communication118; visualization119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Volunteers responded that their participation in Sea Search activities made them feel good emotionally and mentally, with active learning, such as remembering names of marine biota, stimulating brain activity and memory. Volunteer monitoring efforts generated personal satisfaction through their contributions, feelings of enjoyment, and socialising with others. Sea Search volunteers gain a sense of want to protect and conserve the marine environment through positive behaviour change. By understanding and having a sense of meaning towards the marine environment, the volunteers felt a sense of pride in themselves. The concepts of volunteer connection to the natural environment and positive mental and emotional health are important for any citizen science monitoring program and should be used in the program’s aims and strategies as an effective means to attract volunteers.

We present results of a field experiment where observers recorded observations for known combinations of electronically broadcast calling anurans under conditions mimicking field surveys to determine species occurrence. Our objectives were to characterize false positive error probabilities for auditory methods based on a large number of observers, to determine if targeted instruction could be used to reduce false positive error rates, and to establish useful predictors of among-observer and among-species differences in error rates. We recruited 31 observers, ranging in abilities from novice to expert, who recorded detections for 12 species during 180 calling trials (66 960 total observations). All observers made multiple false positive errors, and on average 8.1% of recorded detections in the experiment were false positive errors. Additional instruction had only minor effects on error rates. After instruction, false positive error probabilities decreased by 16% for treatment individuals compared to controls with broad confidence interval overlap of 0 (95% CI: −46 to 30%). This coincided with an increase in false negative errors due to the treatment (26%; −3 to 61%). Differences among observers in false positive and in false negative error rates were best predicted by scores from an online test and a self-assessment of observer ability completed prior to the field experiment. In contrast, years of experience conducting call surveys was a weak predictor of error rates. False positive errors were also more common for species that were played more frequently but were not related to the dominant spectral frequency of the call. Our results corroborate other work that demonstrates false positives are a significant component of species occurrence data collected by auditory methods. Instructing observers to only report detections they are completely certain are correct is not sufficient to eliminate errors. As a result, analytical methods that account for false positive errors will be needed, and independent testing of observer ability is a useful predictor for among-observer variation in observation error rates.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:44:06","2012-12-20","1665-1674","","5","22","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/VTNUABGH/miller_experimental_2012.pdf","","","false negative84; false positive85; misclassification86; occupancy87; occurrence88; species richness89; survey90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, differences in physiology and behavior still cause variations in performance that may precipitate biological inefficiencies by not appreciating the importance of differences among individuals, the capacity of animals to select foods that meet ever-changing individual needs, and the dynamic nature of a nutrient's value to an animal. We examined intakes of groups of lambs offered a single food or three foods differing only in their proportions of cereal grains: High, 70%; Medium, 50%; Low, 40%. Foods consisted of the same ingredients (barley, corn, sugar beet pulp, alfalfa, soybean meal, grape pomace, feather meal, wheat straw), had similar levels of metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP), and met NRC requirements. We hypothesized that intake and performance would be greater when animals had a choice of foods because high grain concentrations would not limit intake of individuals unable to process high amounts of energy from grain. In general, lambs offered a Choice of the three foods ate more, converted food more efficiently, and cost less per unit gain than lambs fed the High food (P &lt; 0.05). Animals fed the Low or Medium foods were intermediate in their responses between these two extremes. Within Choice, preference for High, Medium, and Low shifted from the beginning (21 d) to the finishing (21 d) periods of the trial. Though lambs in the Choice treatment preferred Low &gt; Medium and High in the beginning stage of the trial, their preferences became pronounced as we increased the amount of grain in each food during the finishing period (P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, our findings suggest improved intake, rate of gain, and feed efficiency can result when animals are allowed to select their diets from biochemically complementary foods, possibly enabling them to realize greater benefits than typically thought from inexpensive forages. In addition, offering animals choices is an alternative to feeding uniform diets of rapidly fermented energy, a major cause of illness in feedlots.","May 2006","2014-09-21 02:41:36","2014-09-21 02:41:36","","142-149","","1–3","101","","Livestock Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Animal performance; Diet; Feed efficiency; Food; Intake; Mixed ration; Selection; Variety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The profitability that might be expected from perennial wheat of different types was investigated using MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System), a bioeconomic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. Although perennial wheat may produce a lower grain yield and quality than annual wheat, it is expected inputs of fertiliser, herbicide and sowing costs will be lower. Perennial wheat used solely for grain production was not selected as part of an optimal farm plan under the standard assumptions. In contrast, dual-purpose perennial wheat that produces grain and additional forage during summer and autumn than annual wheat can increase farm profitability substantially (AU$20/ha over the whole farm) and 20% of farm area was selected on the optimal farm plan under standard assumptions. Forage from perennial wheat replaced stubble over summer and grain supplement at the break of season and increased farm stock numbers. The additional value added by grazing also reduced the relative yield required for perennial wheat to be profitable. This analysis suggests perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers.","March 2008","2014-09-21 02:39:52","2014-09-21 02:39:52","","166-174","","1–3","96","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Benefit–cost; Dual-purpose; MIDAS; Perennial crop; Profitability; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Total LUC risk comprises all emissions from land use change caused by commercial agriculture worldwide, allocated to products based on their land use. We compared a standard feed composition (STAND) with four alternative diets directed at reducing the CFP: in CROP diet we assumed an improved crop production through 10% increased crop yields or 10% decreased fertilizer use; in EU diet we excluded soybean products and used European grown feed ingredients only; in BY-P diet we maximized the use of by-products from food and bio-energy industry; and in N-LOW diet we limited crude protein content to 13% while adding synthetic amino acids. Our analysis showed that the method chosen to account for LUC has a major impact on the CFP of each diet and, therefore, affects mutual comparison of diets. Based on the reference CFP, CROP diet showed the lowest CFP, i.e. −6% compared to STAND. When accounting for direct LUC, EU diet had the lowest CFP, i.e. −15% compared to STAND, by avoiding soybean products. When accounting for total LUC risk, N-LOW diet had the lowest CFP, i.e. −9% compared to STAND. We discussed that each of the considered land use change accounting methods has specific strengths and limitations. As a result, we proposed two decision rules when formulating low CFP diets, i.e.: (1) avoid direct land use change as much as possible; and (2) within this precondition, minimize carbon footprint including total land use change risk to encourage the formulation of diets that combine a low reference carbon footprint with low land use requirements.","November 2012","2014-09-21 02:41:35","2014-09-21 02:41:35","","215-223","","3","149","","Livestock Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon footprint; Direct land use change; Feed; Pig; Total LUC risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, annual crop production has resulted in significant reductions in soil fertility and now requires intensive inputs to maintain yields. Soil food webs were compared between hayed native grasslands and adjacent annual croplands in order to determine the long-term effects of these two production systems on soil ecosystem properties. Soil chemical and physical properties, bacterial and nematode community structure and abundance were measured across five paired sites at six depth intervals to 1 m. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and water stable aggregates were all significantly greater in perennial grasslands than in annual croplands to a depth of 60 cm. Microbial biomass carbon was also greater in grasslands than in croplands, and shifts in δ13C indicated greater input of new carbon at lower depths in grasslands relative to annual croplands. Bacterial and nitrogen fixing communities in croplands and grasslands were significantly different in the surface 40 cm and nematode community differences persisted through 1 m. Nematode community indices suggested enhanced fungal decomposition pathways, fewer plant-feeding nematodes, and greater food web complexity and stability in grassland soils than in annual cropland soils.

Across all species and geographic locations, species shifted arrival dates 0.8 days earlier for every °C of warming of spring temperature, but it was common for some species in some locations to shift as much as 3–6 days earlier per °C. Species that advanced arrival dates the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63% of the interspecific variation in phenological response. We also identify a latitudinal gradient in the average strength of phenological response, with species shifting arrival earlier at southern latitudes than northern latitudes for the same degree of warming.

Achieving this goal will be challenging due to the decreased availability of arable land, resulting from urbanization and land degradation. Soil salinity is a major factor contributing to the latter process. While some improvement in crop yields in saline soils may be achieved as a consequence of single gene transfers, the real progress may be achieved only via a painfully slow “pyramiding” of essential physiological traits. Given the time constraints, a safer solution to meet the 2050 challenge may be to find alternative crop and forage species for farming in salt-affected conditions and to restore salt-affected areas. This review focuses on the suitability of halophytes to become important components of 21st century farming systems. We provide a comprehensive summary of the current use of halophytes for human food consumption, for forage and animal feeds, as oilseed and energy crops, and for desalination and phytoremediation purposes. We argue that the use of halophytes may be a viable commercial alternative to ease pressure on the requirement of good quality land and water for conventional cropping systems and the utilization of land degraded by salinity.","November 2014","2014-09-21 02:40:21","2014-09-21 02:40:21","","71-83","","0","107","","Environmental and Experimental Botany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Desalination; Energy crops; Forage species; Phytoremediation; Saline agriculture; Saline irrigation; Salinity; Sodium removal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phaeozems represent 3% of soils in Europe and they are particularly common in wet steppe regions. In this paper, the yield of winter wheat over 50 years of farmyard manure (FYM), N, P and K fertilizer application (12 treatments altogether) was analyzed in the Čáslav Crop Rotation Experiment (CCRE), which was established in 1955 in a sugar beet growing area (mean annual precipitation and temperature 555 mm and 8.9 °C, respectively). In the unfertilized control treatment, low plant available P and suitable K concentrations were recorded after 50 years. The annual yield growth (AYG) of grain was positive, even in the control treatment without any fertilizer input. The mean AYG ranged from 24.9 kg ha−1 in the control treatment to 73.6 kg ha−1 following the application of 119 kg N ha−1. In the first two decades of the experiment, there was no significant effect of treatment on grain yield. The increase in grain yield per 1 kg of applied N was 20.1 kg ha−1 in the last decade of the experiment. The mean grain yields of long-straw and short-straw varieties were 3.8 and 5.5 t ha−1, respectively. In the control, the grain yields were 4.8, 4.1 and 3.3 t ha−1 after legumes, root crops and cereals, respectively. To summarize the 50 years of results of winter wheat production in the CCRE, grain yield was most influenced by variety, followed by mineral fertilizers, the preceding crop and only moderately by FYM application. The highest grain yields were recorded in treatments with the highest N application rate. The long-term stability of winter wheat production on Greyic Phaeozem can be expected under a crop rotation system with legumes and root crops, even without any fertilizer input.","October 2010","2014-09-21 02:40:38","2014-09-21 02:40:38","","166-174","","3","33","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Farmyard manure (FYM); Grain production; Long-term fertilizer experiment; Preceding crop; Sustainability; Triticum aestivum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, monitoring by trained scientists is time consuming and expensive. Using social networks, we assess whether it is possible to obtain accurate data on bee distribution across the UK from photographic records submitted by untrained members of the public, and if these data are in sufficient quantity for ecological studies. We used Flickr and Facebook as social networks and Flickr for the storage of photographs and associated data on date, time and location linked to them. Within six weeks, the number of pictures uploaded to the Flickr BeeID group exceeded 200. Geographic coverage was excellent; the distribution of photographs covered most of the British Isles, from the south coast of England to the Highlands of Scotland. However, only 59% of photographs were properly uploaded according to instructions, with vital information such as ‘tags’ or location information missing from the remainder. Nevertheless, this incorporation of information on location of photographs was much higher than general usage on Flickr (∼13%), indicating the need for dedicated projects to collect spatial ecological data. Furthermore, we found identification of bees is not possible from all photographs, especially those excluding lower abdomen detail. This suggests that giving details regarding specific anatomical features to include on photographs would be useful to maximise success. The study demonstrates the power of social network sites to generate public interest in a project and details the advantages of using a group within an existing popular social network site over a traditional (specifically-designed) web-based or paper-based submission process. Some advantages include the ability to network with other individuals or groups with similar interests, and thus increasing the size of the dataset and participation in the project.","2010-12-17","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","e14381","","12","5","","PLoS ONE","Eu-social science","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS ONE","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/AQD4CDGH/stafford_eu-social_2010.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there have been few evaluations of the contributions of citizen scientists to knowledge of biological communities in and around cities. To assess the effectiveness of citizen scientists’ monitoring of species in urban areas, we compared butterfly data collected over 10 years in Chicago, Illinois (U.S.A.), and New York City, New York (U.S.A.). The dates, locations, and methods of data collection in Chicago were standardized, whereas data from New York were collected at any location at any time. For each city, we evaluated whether the number of observers, observation days (days on which observations were reported), and sampling locations were associated with the reported proportion of the estimated regional pool of butterfly species. We also compared the number of volunteers, duration of volunteer involvement, and consistency of sampling efforts at individual locations within each city over time. From 2001 to 2010, there were 73 volunteers in Chicago and 89 in New York. During this period, volunteers observed 86% and 89% of the estimated number of butterfly species present in Chicago and New York, respectively. Volunteers in New York reported a greater proportion of the estimated pool of butterfly species per year. In addition, more species were observed per volunteer and observation day in New York, largely due to the unrestricted sampling season in New York. Chicago volunteers were active for more years and monitored individual locations more consistently over time than volunteers in New York. Differences in monitoring protocol—especially length of sampling season and selection protocol for monitoring locations—influenced the relationship between species accrual and sampling effort, which suggests these factors are important in volunteer-based species-monitoring programs.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","557–564","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","©2012 Society for Conservation Biology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/9MCGRHK2/matteson_evaluacion_2012.pdf","","","acumulación de especies; biodiversidad urbana; eficiencia de voluntarios; esfuerzo de muestreo; lepidóptera; monitores ciudadanos; sensores ciudadanos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to determine the molecular and biochemical basis conferring glyphosate resistance in this species. Experiments were conducted to assess target EPSPS gene sequences and 14C-glyphosate leaf absorption and translocation to meristematic tissues. RESULTS: Individuals of all resistant (R) accessions exhibited significantly less glyphosate translocation to root (11% versus 29%) and stem (9% versus 26%) meristems when compared with susceptible (S) plants. A notably higher proportion of the applied glyphosate remained in the treated leaves of R plants (63%) than in the treated leaves of S plants (27%). In addition, individuals of S. halepense accession R-2 consistently showed lower glyphosate absorption rates in both adaxial (10-20%) and abaxial (20-25%) leaf surfaces compared with S plants. No glyphosate resistance endowing mutations in the EPSPS gene at Pro-101-106 residues were found in any of the evaluated R accessions. CONCLUSION: The results of the present investigation indicate that reduced glyphosate translocation to meristems is the primary mechanism endowing glyphosate resistance in S. halepense from cropping fields in Argentina. To a lesser extent, reduced glyphosate leaf uptake has also been shown to be involved in glyphosate-resistant S. halepense.

The F1 hybrids varied widely in plant type, but on average they had small plant size and low main tiller weights at anthesis, similar to O. rufipogon, and had intermediate tiller numbers and final single plant weights similar to cultivated rice. O. rufipogon had higher concentrations of starch in stems at anthesis, while interspecific hybrids exhibited comparatively low leaf, stem + sheath, and root sugar concentrations. Near anthesis, substantial 14C label remained in the source (flag) leaf in O. sativa and F1 hybrids, while in O. rufipogon more label was exported to sink tissues.

Although lab work is needed, bioindicator-based studies rely extensively on field assessment of a few or limited number of taxa. Sampling, statistics and species identification form a large part of these studies, and must be supported by knowledge of the basic biological and ecological features of the organisms and landscape under study. Computerized open databases offering images and multiple entering accessions are expected to improve the current identification and analysis methods based on manuals, books and two-dimensional figures. Bioindicator-based studies have the potential to make a major contribution to optimizing different farming systems, input practices, new crops, rotation, etc., and to influence political policies governing landscape management, urban and industrial areas; landscape reclamation and transformation. In particular, laws aimed at reducing environmental contamination and at remediating high input farming must take into consideration environmental benefits that can be assessed using bioindicators; evaluations of new genetically engineered crops must consider biodiversity as a value and bioindicators as tools that can help in reaching decisions about their environmental impact.","June 1999","2014-09-21 02:41:27","2014-09-21 02:41:27","","1-18","","1–3","74","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity; Bioindicators; Environments; Invertebrates; Landscapes; Reclamation; Rural environments; Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used data from repeated visits to 1-ha pixels to derive ‘detection histories’ and apply site-occupancy models to estimate the ‘true’ species distribution, i.e. corrected for imperfect detection. We modelled blue hawker distribution as a function of elevation and year and its detection probability of elevation, year and season.Results The best model contained cubic polynomial elevation effects for distribution and quadratic effects of elevation and season for detectability. We compared the site-occupancy model with a conventional distribution model based on a generalized linear model, which assumes perfect detectability (p = 1). The conventional distribution map looked very different from the distribution map obtained using site-occupancy models that accounted for the imperfect detection. The conventional model underestimated the species distribution by 60%, and the slope parameters of the occurrence–elevation relationship were also underestimated when assuming p = 1. Elevation was not only an important predictor of blue hawker occurrence, but also of the detection probability, with a bell-shaped relationship. Furthermore, detectability increased over the season. The average detection probability was estimated at only 0.19 per survey.Main conclusions Conventional species distribution models do not model species distributions per se but rather the apparent distribution, i.e. an unknown proportion of species distributions. That unknown proportion is equivalent to detectability. Imperfect detection in conventional species distribution models yields underestimates of the extent of distributions and covariate effects that are biased towards zero. In addition, patterns in detectability will erroneously be ascribed to species distributions. In contrast, site-occupancy models applied to replicated detection/non-detection data offer a powerful framework for making inferences about species distributions corrected for imperfect detection. The use of ‘cheap’ checklist data greatly enhances the scope of applications of this useful class of models.","2010","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1851–1862","","10","37","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/TQTKTMW4/kery_predicting_2010.pdf","","","Aeshna cyanea; checklists; Citizen science; detection probability; dragonfly; generalized linear model; hierarchical model; Odonata; species distribution model; Switzerland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assist wildlife professionals in identifying potential hot spots of interaction and homeowners in evaluating their risk of a backyard encounter, we used the techniques of citizen science to build a landscape model of HCI for suburban residential properties in Westchester County, New York, USA. We distributed surveys via school children (kindergarten to grade 12) as part of a voluntary class assignment, to maximize the number of homeowners participating in our study and to provide learning experiences for students. Of 6,000 surveys distributed to schools, >1,500 students interviewed their parents on whether a coyote had been seen or heard on their property from 2003 to 2006. Although surveys could not be distributed randomly owing to the participatory process of individual schools, we did receive responses from across Westchester County, representing the spectrum from the most rural to the most urban towns. Homeowners who encountered (i.e., seen or heard) a coyote on their property were on average 50% closer to forest, 36% closer to grassland, and 66% farther from medium- to high-intensity development, complementing existing knowledge on urban coyote habitat use. Our model seemed robust in predicting an independent set of coyote observations (r  =  0.88). Based on this model, we generated a map describing the probability of HCI that can be used by both wildlife professionals and homeowners. Regarding the former, state wildlife agencies could more precisely target education campaigns on how to live with coyotes where the possibility of HCI was greatest. Homeowners, in turn, could evaluate their own risk and modify behaviors that would make their property less attractive to coyotes. Furthermore, in creating a descriptive model of HCI from citizen-generated data, we demonstrated how citizen science can be a useful exploratory tool, generating a wealth of data over a large geographic area in a short period, especially when the inquest is appropriate to stakeholder participation in data collection.","2010-06-22","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1163-1171","","5","74","","Journal of Wildlife Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioOne","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/2BFAJM3M/weckel_using_2010.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified impacts of perennial WSGs and row crops on soil wind erodibility parameters (erodible fraction, geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates, and aggregate stability) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration under a dedicated bioenergy crop experiment in eastern Kansas after 4 and 5 yr of management. Soil properties were measured under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and annual row crops including continuous corn (Zea mays L.), photoperiod sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sweet sorghum, and grain sorghum. Perennial WSGs reduced wind erodible fraction by 1.08 to 1.16 times compared with row crops. The geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates under switchgrass and miscanthus was 2.8 to 4.5 times greater than under row crops. Dry soil aggregate stability under miscanthus and big bluestem was greater than under row crops. After 5 yr, differences in SOC concentration between WSGs and row crops were not statistically significant for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Photoperiod sensitive and sweet sorghum had greater biomass yield than WSGs. In 2011, miscanthus yielded more biomass than corn by 5.3 Mg ha(-1). Overall, growing dedicated bioenergy crops can reduce the soil's susceptibility to wind erosion but may not significantly increase SOC concentration in this region in the short term.","SEP-OCT 2013","2015-06-01 16:22:21","2015-06-01 16:22:21","","1271-1276","","5","105","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question is whether this will remain so or whether the hunger of the poor will once more be exacerbated by rising food prices. In this paper we discuss biophysical conditions, social forces and non-linear interactions that may critically influence the global availability of food in the long term. Until 2050, the global demand for primary phytomass for food will more than double, while competing claims to natural resources for other purposes (including biobased non-foods] will increase. A sober assessment of the earth's biophysical potential for biomass production, which recognizes competing claims and unavoidable losses, suggests that this is in itself still large enough for accommodating this rising demand. However, the exploitation of this biophysical potential proceeds through technical paradigms that set a relative maximum to food production. In addition, socio-economic mechanisms make the food economy run up against a ceiling even before this maximum is reached. As a consequence, current developments may well entail a new trend change in international markets. These developments include the depletion of land and water reserves, the stagnation of the potential yields of major crops, the rise in energy prices, and the way in which systemic socio-economic factors lead to a strong underutilization of production possibilities in the developing world. Given these conditions, the avoidance of steep rises in food prices may depend on the timely relaxation of socio-economic constraints in developing countries and on timely breakthroughs in sustainable yield increases, biorefinement and non-farm production systems. Myopic expectations make it doubtful whether spontaneous market forces will provide the necessary incentives for this, which may be reason for societal actors to consider the need for more active policies.","April 2008","2014-09-21 02:41:16","2014-09-21 02:41:16","","229-292","","3","55","","NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biofuels; biorefinement; competing claims; food markets; food prices; food security; potential production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on management level and vegetational and structural complexity, it is possible to distinguish five main coffee production systems in Mexico: two kinds of traditional shaded agroforests (with native trees), one commercially oriented polyspecific shaded system, and two “modern” systems (shaded and unshaded monocultures). Traditional shaded coffee is cultivated principally by small-scale, community-based growers, most of whom belong to some indigenous culture group. Through an exhaustive review of the literature, we found that traditional shaded coffee plantations are important repositories of biological richness for groups such as trees and epiphytes, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods. We evaluated the conservation role of these traditional shaded systems by estimating the percentage of the whole coffee area under traditional management, by reviewing the ecological and geographical distribution of coffee areas in Mexico, and by connecting the geographical distribution of these coffee areas with recognized centers of species richness and endemism. The assesment revealed that in Mexico, coffee fields are located in a biogeographically and ecologically strategic elevational belt that is an area of overlap between the tropical and temperate elements and of contact among the four main types of Mexican forests. We also found that between 60% and 70% of these coffee areas are under traditional management and that at least 14 of 155 priority regions selected by experts as having high numbers of species and endemics overlap with or are near traditional coffee-growing areas.","1999","2015-02-11 14:41:46","2015-02-11 14:41:46","2015-02-11 14:41:46","11-21","","1","13","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","1999 Society for Conservation Biology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/K6GKQZMC/moguel_biodiversity_2001.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Growing emphasis is on adequate policies that can support both agriculture and sustainable development. Integrated Assessment and Modelling (IAM) can provide insight into the potential impacts of policy changes. An increasing number of Integrated Assessment (IA) models are being developed, but these are mainly monolithic and are targeted to answer specific problems. Approaches that allow flexible IA for a range of issues and functions are scarce. Recently, a methodology for policy support in agriculture has been developed that attempts to overcome some of the limitations of earlier IA models. The proposed framework (SEAMLESS-IF) integrates relationships and processes across disciplines and scales and combines quantitative analysis with qualitative judgments and experiences. It builds on the concept of systems analysis and attempts to enable flexible coupling of models and tools. The present paper aims to describe progress in improving flexibility of IAM achieved with the methodology developed for SEAMLESS-IF. A brief literature review identifying limitations in the flexibility of IAM is followed by a description of the progress achieved with SEAMLESS-IF. Two example applications are used to illustrate relevant capabilities of SEAMLESS-IF. The examples refer to (i) the impacts on European agriculture of changes in world trade regulations and (ii) regional impacts of the EU Nitrates Directive in combination with agro-management changes. We show that improving the flexibility of IAM requires flexibility in model linking but also a generic set up of all IA steps. This includes problem and scenario definition, the selection and specification of indicators and the indicator framework, the structuring of the database, and the visualization of results. Very important is the flexibility to integrate, select and link models, data and indicators depending on the application. Technical coupling and reusability of model components is greatly improved through adequate software architecture (SEAMLESS-IF uses OpenMI). The use of ontology strongly supports conceptual consistency of model linkages. However, the scientific basis for linking models across disciplines and scales is still weak and requires specific attention in future research. We conclude that the proposed framework significantly advances flexibility in IAM and that it is a good basis to further improve integrated modelling for policy impact assessment in agriculture.","August 2009","2014-09-21 02:42:13","2014-09-21 02:42:13","","546-561","","5","12","","Environmental Science & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture; Indicators; Model linking; Scaling; Scenarios; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench)/pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), groundnut (Archis hypogaea L.)/pigeonpea, sorghum/pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke), and groundnut/pearl millet, were evaluated along with sole crops from 1979 to 1982, each year in nine different situations spread over different soil types and agronomic managements, with the objective of analysing the productivity and risk associated with these systems. Productivity of intercrops was closely related to the diversity of the crops involved. The two pigeonpea-based systems, with an interval of about 3 months between harvests of the crops, showed a large and consistent advantage over the respective sole crops. On the basis of land productivity, sorghum/pigeonpea averaged 49% and pigeonpea/groundnut 53% advantage over their respective sole-crop yields. In economic terms, these intercrops were also more profitable than the respective sole crops. The other two systems, with only 2–4 weeks' difference between harvests of the components, showed a much lower and less-consistent advantage. The groundnut/millet recorded 18% advantage and the sorghum/millet 7% over their respective sole crops. Risk was measured by calculating the probability of success or failure of intercrops in satisfying specified quantities of yields or income in comparison with an optimal shared sole system having some of both sole crops. Pigeonpea-based intercropping systems were less risky than shared (or optimal) sole crops over a wide range of expected yields or income. There was no advantage for the sorghum/millet intercropping compared with the shared sole crops at lower expectation, and for higher expectations sole sorghum should be preferred to the intercrop. Risk from groundnut/millet was less than from the shared sole system only in limited situations. Reduced risk of pigeonpea-based intercrops was associated with higher productivity and lower variability of combined intercrop yields or income. The methods employed in this study can be extended for risk evaluation in other intercropping and mixed systems.","June 1990","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","2014-09-12 13:39:44","279-293","","3–4","23","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their sediments are muddy sands and are mainly composed of gypsum with small amounts of shells, shell fragments, quartz and feldspars. Two types of gypsum are recognised: detrital grains and authigenic crystals. The authigenesis of gypsum within the nabkha detrital sediments is responsible for the significant increase in the volume of the nabkhas as well as considerable change in their morphology from a standard aerodynamic form to a whaleback shape. The genesis and diagenesis of the nabkha sediments are discussed, and future studies are recommended.

This can be problematical for species that are cryptic and have imperfect detection. We used occupancy modeling and power analysis to optimize the survey design for reptile monitoring programs in the UK. Surveys were carried out six times a year in 2009–2010 at multiple sites. Four out of the six species – grass snake, adder, common lizard, slow-worm –were encountered during every survey from March-September. The exceptions were the two rarest species ­– sand lizard and smooth snake – which were not encountered in July 2009 and March 2010 respectively. The most frequently encountered and most easily detected species was the slow-worm. For the four widespread reptile species in the UK, three to four survey visits that used a combination of directed transect walks and artificial cover objects resulted in 95% certainty that a species would be detected if present. Using artificial cover objects was an effective detection method for most species, considerably increased the detection rate of some, and reduced misidentifications. To achieve an 85% power to detect a decline in any of the four widespread species when the true decline is 15%, three surveys at a total of 886 sampling sites, or four surveys at a total of 688 sites would be required. The sampling effort needed reduces to 212 sites surveyed three times, or 167 sites surveyed four times, if the target is to detect a true decline of 30% with the same power. The results obtained can be used to refine reptile survey protocols in the UK and elsewhere. On a wider scale, the occupancy study design approach can be used to optimize survey effort and help set targets for conservation outcomes for regional or national biodiversity assessments.","2012","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2013-07-19 23:47:19","2012-12-20","e43387","","8","7","","PLoS ONE","When is a species declining?","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS ONE","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/X6PCSMRW/sewell_when_2012.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two major gaps were identified: (1) a need to compare and contrast the success (and the situations that induce success) of CBM programs which present sound evidence of citizen scientists influencing positive environmental changes in the local ecosystems they monitor and (2) more case studies showing use of CBM data by decision-makers or the barriers to linkages and how these might be overcome.

Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system.","July 17, 2003","2015-04-14 15:02:50","2015-04-14 15:02:50","2015-04-14 15:02:50","99-118","","3","22","","","Agroecology","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/HXZXE632/francis_agroecology_2003.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts.

A particular challenge in this context is the consistent translation of a wide range of policy questions into scenarios that a modelling framework can assess. The present work defines a methodology for scenario-development in integrated policy assessment with specific emphasis on SEAMLESS-IF. After a general overview on scenario concepts for integrated policy assessment the adopted scenario concept and its development procedure is presented. They allow building integrated scenarios capturing the range of drivers of the assessed agricultural system in a consistent way across temporal and spatial scales. Then focus is on the particular procedures to translate the policy assessment questions into scenario parameters and to implement these parameters into SEAMLESS-IF. Two examples targeted at European and regional level combining integrated assessments of policy changes and technological innovations are considered to illustrate the SEAMLESS scenario concept. We conclude that the proposed methodology to translate policy assessment problems into scenarios effectively supports integrated assessment in SEAMLESS-IF or even in other modelling frameworks.","August 2009","2014-09-21 02:42:11","2014-09-21 02:42:11","","619-630","","5","12","","Environmental Science & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural systems; Integrated assessment and modelling; Scales; Scenario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although trophic levels are among the most basic information collected for animals in ecosystems, a human trophic level (HTL) has never been defined. Here, we find a global HTL of 2.21, i.e., the trophic level of anchoveta. This value has increased with time, consistent with the global trend toward diets higher in meat. National HTLs ranging between 2.04 and 2.57 reflect a broad diversity of diet, although cluster analysis of countries with similar dietary trends reveals only five major groups.

The environmental performance refers to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the primary fossil energy use and to the impact on fresh water reserves, soil erosion and biodiversity. Analyses are carried out for regions in five countries. The lowest costs of producing (including storing and transporting across 100 km) in the year 2004 are calculated for Poland, Hungary and Lithuania at 43–64 € per oven dry tonne (odt) or 2.4–3.6 € GJ−1 higher heating value. This cost level is roughly equivalent to the price of natural gas (3.1 € GJ−1) and lower than the price of crude oil (4.6 € GJ−1) in 2004, but higher than the price of coal (1.7 € GJ−1) in 2004. The costs of biomass in Italy and the United Kingdom are somewhat higher (65–105 € odt−1 or 3.6–5.8 € GJ−1). The doubling of the price of crude oil and natural gas that is projected for the period 2004–2030, combined with nearly stable biomass production costs, makes the production of perennial grasses competitive with natural gas and fossil oil. The results also show that the substitution of fossil fuels by biomass from perennial grasses is a robust strategy to reduce fossil energy use and curb GHG emissions, provided that perennial grasses are grown on agricultural land (cropland or pastures). However, in such case deep percolation and runoff of water are reduced, which can lead to overexploitation of fresh water reservoirs. This can be avoided by selecting suitable locations (away from direct accessible fresh water reservoirs) and by limiting the size of the plantations. The impacts on biodiversity are generally favourable compared to conventional crops, but the location of the plantation compared to other vegetation types and the size and harvesting regime of the plantation are important variables.","August 2009","2014-09-21 02:41:08","2014-09-21 02:41:08","2009-09-02","1230-1245","","6–7","13","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity; Costs; Greenhouse gas emissions; Miscanthus; Primary energy use; Soil erosion; Switchgrass; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As our numbers and appetites grow, food supplies become less secure, reserves of clean energy dwindle, pools of freshwater evaporate, the atmosphere's capacity to absorb our emissions diminishes and space for human and biotic habitat grows scarce. In response, some are now asking whether the biosphere can support our growing herds of domesticated livestock, notably ruminants. My aim in this review is to contemplate the place of these animals in a world in need of re-greening, in more ways than one. In addressing this objective, I advance the premise that the place of livestock is examined best from the vantage of ‘land’, broadly defined. Livestock have been implicated in many injurious processes: land use change, excess water use, nutrient excretion, fossil energy use, competition for food and emission of greenhouse gases. At the same time, they offer numerous benefits: producing food from human inedible sources, preserving ecosystem services, promoting perennials on croplands, recycling plant nutrients and providing social benefits. Thus livestock can be both stressors and benefactors to land and the aim of researchers should be to shift the net effect from stress to beneficence. To advance this goal, I offer seven questions, seen through the lenses of ‘systems’, ‘place’, ‘time’ and ‘community’, mostly to foster discourse. How do we better study whole systems? How do we better tune the systems to local land? How can we know long term consequences? How do we measure progress? How do we choose among trade-offs? How do we engage society? What will (or should) our successors’ livestock systems look like? Humans and their livestock are intertwined to such an extent that their symbiosis will not likely soon be severed. Livestock offer many benefits to human society and often their place in ecosystems can be ecologically justified. But that does not mean that all ways of raising them are beneficial, nor that they necessarily fit everywhere. In coming decades, researchers, in concert with practitioners, consumers and policymakers, will need to show creativity, foresight and courage to envision new ways of melding animals into our ecosystems, not only to minimize harm, but to advance their re-greening.

Tlaxcalan farmers grow corn in an array of poly-culture and agroforestry designs that result in a series of ecological processes important for insect pest and soil fertility management. Measurements derived from a few selected fields show that trees integrated into cropping systems modify the aerial and soil environment of associated understory corn plants, influencing their growth and yields. With decreasing distance from trees, surface concentrations of most soil nutrients increase. Certain tree species affect corn yields more than others. Arthropod abundance also varies depending on their degree of association with one or more of the vegetational components of the system. Densities of predators and the corn pest Macrodactylussp. depend greatly on the presence and phenology of adjacent alfalfa strips. Although the data were derived from nonreplicated fields, they nevertheless point out some important trends, information that can be used to design new crop associations that will achieve sustained soil fertility and low pest potentials.","1987-06-01","2015-05-20 20:42:42","2015-05-20 20:42:42","2015-05-20 20:42:42","189-220","","2","15","","Hum Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/ZFQSSN6D/altieri-agroecology-1987.pdf","","","Agroecology; agroforestry; Anthropology/Archaeometry; corn agroecosystem; Environmental Management; polycultures; Sociology; traditional farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts are also made to minimize losses from the system, such as by leaching or removal of crop residues. The use of non-renewable inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers that can damage the environment or harm the health of farmers and consumers is also minimized, and more emphasis is placed on the use of such techniques as, for example, intercropping, agroforestry, cover crops, or animal manure.

They are crucial to the survival of plants and most of the animals that harbour them. An example of a non-photosynthesizing plastid in animals is the apicoplast in the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, which is required for survival of the parasite. Many animals (such as sea slugs, sponges, reef corals, and clams) consume prey containing chloroplasts, or feed on algae. Some of these incorporate the chloroplasts from their food, or whole algal cells, into their own cells. Other species from these groups place algal cells between their own cells. Reef-building corals often lose their intracellular algae as a result of environmental changes, resulting in coral bleaching and death. The sensitivity of the chloroplast internal membranes to temperature stress is one of the reasons for coral death. Chloroplasts can also be a causal factor in the processes leading to whole-plant death, as the knockout of a gene encoding a chloroplast protein delayed the yellowing that proceeds death in tobacco plants.

Characterizing the response of deep soil moisture to land use and afforestation is important for the sustainability of vegetation restoration in this region. In this paper, the dynamics of soil moisture were quantified to evaluate the effect of land use on soil moisture at a depth of 2 m. Specifically, the gravimetric soil moisture content was measured in the soil layer between 0 and 8 m for five land use types in the Longtan catchment of the western Loess Plateau. The land use types included traditional farmland, native grassland, and lands converted from traditional farmland (pasture grassland, shrubland and forestland). Results indicate that the deep soil moisture content decreased more than 35% after land use conversion, and a soil moisture deficit appeared in all types of land with introduced vegetation. The introduced vegetation decreased the soil moisture content to levels lower than the reference value representing no human impact in the entire 0–8 m soil profile. No significant differences appeared between different land use types and introduced vegetation covers, especially in deeper soil layers, regardless of which plant species were introduced. High planting density was found to be the main reason for the severe deficit of soil moisture. Landscape management activities such as tillage activities, micro-topography reconstruction, and fallowed farmland affected soil moisture in both shallow and deep soil layers. Tillage and micro-topography reconstruction can be used as effective countermeasures to reduce the soil moisture deficit due to their ability to increase soil moisture content. For sustainable vegetation restoration in a vulnerable semi-arid region, the plant density should be optimized with local soil moisture conditions and appropriate landscape management practices.","December 19, 2012","2014-09-21 02:41:34","2014-09-21 02:41:34","","111-122","","0","475","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Afforestation; Land use; Loess Plateau; Soil water; Vegetation restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since perennial plants allocate resources preferentially to perpetuation and to structural and functional characters that provide drought tolerance, they tend to have lower reproductive output (yield) than their congeneric annuals. Four species of Lesquerella native to arid regions were evaluated to understand the relationships between reproduction, drought tolerance, and their association with the plant's life span. We assessed the following set of characters (defined as plant strategies): phenology, gas exchange, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, total biomass and biomass allocation. Annual (Lesquerella gracilis and Lesquerella angustifolia) and perennial (Lesquerella mendocina and Lesquerella pinetorum) species were compared under water limiting conditions. Within this set of species differences in structural and functional characters were observed. The annual, L. gracilis showed a plant strategy characterized by high reproductive output, harvest index (HI) and specific leaf area (SLA). L. mendocina (perennial), produced more total biomass, but had a low reproductive output, and also showed characters that provide drought tolerance (high allocation to roots-root mass ratio (RMR), and storage-total non structural carbohydrates (TNC) and low SLA). The annual L. angustifolia and the perennial L. pinetorum had intermediate plant strategies (i.e. intermediate values of traits typically related with annual or perennial life span). In the case of L. pinetorum we found some traits common to L. mendocina: long vegetative period, high biomass, CO2 assimilation rate (A), and water use efficiency (WUE), and low SLA. The high reproductive output in L. pinetorum was a result of both, higher total biomass and longer growing season compared to the annuals, and of higher HI in relation to the other perennial. These differences in plant strategies among perennial Lesquerella show that there are different combinations of traits that could be used as criteria for the selection of a perennial crop in programs of domestication for Patagonia and others arid lands.","September 2011","2014-09-21 02:40:10","2014-09-21 02:40:10","","1386-1392","","2","34","","Industrial Crops and Products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arid lands; Patagonia; Perennial cycle; Plant strategy; Root mass ratio; Specific leaf area; Total non structural carbohydrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that the theoretical efficiency of conversion of whole spectrum solar energy into biomass is 4.6–6%, depending on plant type, and the best year-long efficiencies realized are about 3%. The average leaf is as effective as the best PV solar cells in transducing solar energy to charge separation (ca. 37%). In photosynthesis, most of the energy that is lost is dissipated as heat during synthesis of biomass. Unlike photovoltaic (PV) cells this energetic cost supports the construction, maintenance, and replacement of the system, which is achieved autonomously as the plant grows and re-grows. Advances in plant genomics are being applied to plant breeding, thereby enabling rapid development of next-generation energy crops that capitalize on theoretical efficiencies while maintaining environmental and economic integrity.","June 2008","2014-09-21 02:41:39","2014-09-21 02:41:39","","202-209","","3","19","","Current Opinion in Biotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because product yield and concentration exert a major influence on process economics, improving foreign protein accumulation is crucial for enhancing the commercial success of plant-based production systems. Strategies aimed at increasing transgene expression have been effective; however, a critical but poorly understood factor contributing to low foreign protein yield is post-synthesis and/or post-secretion instability and degradation. Loss of foreign protein as result of biological and physical processes such as proteolytic destruction and irreversible surface adsorption can occur in plants and plant culture systems. This review highlights the need to consider such mechanisms and outlines a range of remedial strategies aimed at minimizing foreign protein degradation and loss.","September 2006","2014-09-21 02:42:16","2014-09-21 02:42:16","","426-432","","9","24","","Trends in Biotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although hundreds of nonnative plant species have naturalized in the United States, only a small percentage of these have been studied in their new biotic communities. Their interactions with resident (native and introduced) bird species remain largely unexplored. As a group, citizen scientists such as ornithologists possess a wide range of experiences. They may offer insights into the prevalence and form of bird interactions with nonnative plants on a broad geographic scale. We surveyed 173 ornithologists from four U.S. states, asking them to report observations of bird interactions with nonnative plants. The primary goal of the survey was to obtain information useful in guiding future empirical research. In all, 1143 unique bird–plant interactions were reported, involving 99 plant taxa and 168 bird species. Forty-seven percent of reported interactions concerned potential dispersal (feeding on seeds or fruits). Remaining “habitat interactions” involved bird use of plants for nesting, perching, woodpecking, gleaning, and other activities. We utilized detrended correspondence analysis to ordinate birds with respect to the plants they reportedly utilize. Results illuminate the new guilds formed by these interactions. We assessed the existing level of knowledge about invasiveness of those plants reported most often in feeding interactions, identifying information gaps for biological invasions research priority. To exemplify the usefulness of citizen science data, we utilized survey results to guide field research on invasiveness in some of these plant species and observed both qualitatively and quantitatively strong agreement between survey reports and our empirical data. Questionnaire reports are therefore heuristically informative for the fields of both avian ecology and invasion biology.","2010-06-01","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-30 23:47:44","2012-12-20","1005-1020","","4","20","","Ecological Applications","Avian use of introduced plants","","","","","","","","","","","","ESA Journals","","","","/home/paul/.mozilla/firefox/quuvkujd.default-1395261540826/zotero/storage/GTNWIE8I/aslan_avian_2010.pdf","","","birds75; citizen science76; guilds77; introduced plants78; invasive species79; mutualisms80; ornithologists81; questionnaire82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to compare perennial weed control in and yields and economic returns from plantings of maturity group (MG) IV and V soybean cultivars grown in the field under different weed management systems (WMS) following shallow (ST) and deep (DT) fall tillage. Adjacent experiments were conducted on Tunica clay (clayey over loamy, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) near Stoneville, MS (lat. 33degrees26'N). Weed management systems were (i) glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine]-resistant (GR) cultivars with preemergent (PRE) nonglyphosate herbicides followed by postemergent (POST) glyphosate; (ii) GR cultivars with POST glyphosate; (iii) non-GR cultivars with PRE plus POST nonglyphosate herbicides; and (iv) non-GR cultivars with POST nonglyphosate herbicides. Control of perennial redvine [Brunnichia ovata (Walt.) Shinners] declined in the ST environment when non-GR cultivars were used, but this did not result in a yield decline. Control of perennial johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] at the end of the study period averaged <40% when non-GR cultivars were used and >93% when GR cultivars were used regardless of tillage treatment, and this was associated with lower yield. Use of PRE + POST vs. POST-only weed management sometimes resulted in lower profits regardless of fall tillage treatment. The fall tillage treatment x WMS interaction was not significant for yield or net return, which indicates that use of DT for perennial weed management is not economical.","MAY-JUN 2004","2015-06-01 16:22:23","2015-06-01 16:22:23","","742-749","","3","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L.) is a highly palatable warm season grass that has the potential to become a perennial grain crop with a high protein content (29% crude protein). Twelve wether lambs were used to evaluate eastern gamagrass grain and cottonseed meal as protein supplements for mature eastern gamagrass hay in a conventional digestion and nitrogen balance trial. Voluntary intake of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, and nitrogen balance were determined for hay alone (CONTROL), hay plus eastern gamagrass grain (GGG), and hay plus cottonseed meal (CSM) treatments. Organic matter intake of supplemented lambs (25.7 g/kg BW) was higher (p&lt;0.001) than lambs fed only hay (20.6 g/kg BW). There was no difference (p=0.22) in OM intake between GGG and CSM supplement treatments. Total tract digestibility of OM differed (p&lt;0.001) among the GGG (61.8%), CSM (58.6%), and CONTROL (54.9%) treatments. However, differences in digestibility may be the result of addition of highly digestible protein and carbohydrate supplements, rather than an increase in digestibility of the hay. Digestibility of NDF was greater (p=0.01) for supplemented lambs (58.4%) than unsupplemented lambs (57.4%) and differed (p=0.04) between the CSM (59.1%) and GGG (57.7%) treatments. Addition of the supplements improved (p&lt;0.001) the digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) of the total diet. The diet with GGG had more (p&lt;0.001) favorable DE and ME values than the CSM supplemented ration. Nitrogen balance was more favorable (p&lt;0.001) for supplemented (+5.7 g N/day) than for unsupplemented lambs (+1.7 g N/day). Lambs supplemented with GGG (+6.3 g N/day) retained more (p=0.01) nitrogen than lambs supplemented with CSM (+5.0 g N/day) even though nitrogen intake was similar (p=0.98). The difference in the nitrogen retention between the supplement treatments was the result of higher (p=0.01) urinary nitrogen excretion from the CSM as compared to the GGG treatment, while fecal nitrogen excretion was similar (p=0.63) for both supplement treatments. Eastern gamagrass grain was comparable to CSM as a protein supplement for moderate to low quality hay.","December 1, 1998","2014-09-21 02:40:11","2014-09-21 02:40:11","","95-102","","1–2","76","","Animal Feed Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","digestibility; Nitrogen balance; Protein; Supplement; Tripsacum dactyloides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
