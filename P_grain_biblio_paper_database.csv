"SSPN5BAM","journalArticle","1936","ALDANOV, A. D.","25 years work of Saratov Central Station of plant-breeding and genetics.","Sotsialisticheskoe Zernovoe Khozyaistvo","","","","","Among the achievements of the station in wheat breeding one of the most outstanding referred to is the production of the spring wheat Lutescens 062 by individual plant selection. This variety has yielded an average of 14.3 c. per ha. over a period of nineteen years and on account of its drought resistance has outyielded the local "" Poltavka "" in the seven worst drought years by 34.2 per cent. Various other varieties both of T. vulgare and T. durum have been produced by the same method, e.g.-Erythrospermum 0341 and T. durum hordeiforme 0432. By interspecific crossing the famous varieties Sarrubra and Sarrosa have been obtained from crosses of T. vulgare (Poltavka) and T. durum (Beloturka). These varieties are distinguished by their high drought resistance; in yield they have surpassed the two parents by 25.4 and 32.1 per cent respectively and are more or less equal to Lutescens 062, which they distinctly excel in milling and baking quality. Sarrubra is free from shedding when standing in the field and is suitable for combine harvesting; the area under this variety is constantly increasing. Other promising hybrids have been produced from later crosses of the same combination of species. Among these is an awnless T. durum equal to the standards in yield and earlier in maturity. Promising results have also been obtained from interracial crosses in T. vulgare and certain varieties resistant to smut and leaf rust have been produced. In winter wheat equally successful results have been obtained. The variety Lutescens 0329 is characterized by exceptional cold resistance, and is closely followed by Lutescens 1060/10; these two varieties have made possible a considerable extension of wheat cultivation in the lower Volga basin. Various newer hybrids are equally, if not more, promising. Many of the hybrids with rye are highly promising in respect of cold and drought resistance, yield and grain quality. The main characteristics of the forms that have proved most popular in cultivation are described. Some of them are equal to rye in earliness of maturity and exceed the standard wheat varieties in yield. They are being further crossed among themselves and with winter wheat and the amphidiploids obtained are also being used in crossing. Perennial rye is also being crossed with winter wheats in the attempt to produce perennial wheats. The same object is pursued in the crosses between Agropyrum and wheat. Some of these hybrids are at the same time possessed of great winter-hardiness and resistance both to drought and to many fungous diseases, and are also tolerant of very unfavourable growth conditions. The hybrids of A. elongaium contain the highest proportion of perennial plants in the later generations. Valuable hardy lines of both annual and perennial type have been isolated and some of these are now in the stage of variety testing. Sunflowers resistant to Orobanche and also to moth and drought have been produced by selection. A valuable new form, No. 169, possesses in addition to these characters, high yielding ability and ripens in 95-104 days, giving also a satisfactory oil content. An early variety ripening in 78 days, also resistant to Orobanche and moth has been selected, and various interesting lines have been obtained by inbreeding. One of these, No. 137 is superior both in yield and oil content and is at the same time rust-resistant. Sunflower crosses have been made, including one between the variety No. 169 and the perennial wild species Helianthus divaricatus; the hybrids are resistant to drought, rust and other fungous diseases, and include a perennial oil form which is receiving attention. Improved strains of rye have been selected and constant lines have been obtained by inbreeding which exceed the standard in yield by 6 to 60 per cent. Crosses have been effected also between rye and Agropyrum Cristatum. Millet has been subjected to selection and improved lines produced, including one No. 853, which is drought-resistant, uniform in ripening, free from shedding, good in grain quality, and unusually high in yield.","1936","2015-06-01 17:39:47","2015-06-01 22:30:08","","131-42","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19371600085","","","","search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses farmers' expected benefits of ecosystem services as input variables to model their decision between planting rice, annual crops or perennial crops. Based on the theory of planned behavior, a Bayesian network is constructed to model crop choice depending on attitudes toward the ecosystem services of biomass production, reduction of soil erosion, and water quality improvement. The relative importance of these decision-making criteria is quantified using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Results indicate that Bayesian networks can use socio-psychological measurements to model decision-making. Especially as an extension to biophysical or economic models, they can serve as a powerful tool for grasping the more abstract socio-psychological dimensions of benefits of ecosystem services, and how they translate into the decisions of ecosystem managers.","July 2014","2015-06-01 19:22:25","2015-06-01 19:22:25","","227-234","","0","57","","Environmental Modelling & Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Analytical Hierarchy Process; Bayesian network; Decision-making support; Ecosystem services; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Theory of planned behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report changes in below-ground soil invertebrate trophic relationships (manifested as alterations in stable isotope natural abundances, δ13C and δ15N) that arose in association with the removal of sheep grazing and from the resulting changes in above-ground floristic composition. Consequent to grazing removal, Lolium perenne L. (perennial rye-grass) was replaced as the dominant plant species in ungrazed treatments by Ranunculus repens L. (creeping buttercup), a species with more 13C-enriched foliage. Consequently, all invertebrate functional groups studied, but not whole soil, were more 13C-enriched in ungrazed treatments. Earthworms (detritivore) from grazed treatments were significantly 15N-enriched compared with earthworms from ungrazed treatments. In contrast, slug (herbivore) δ15N exhibited no treatment effect. Reasons for this are unclear but may be related to the effects of above-ground grazing on the composition of below-ground microbial/microfaunal communities. Omnivores/carnivores (beetles and spiders), were more 15N-enriched than primary producers in the grazed than in the ungrazed treatments (6 vs. 4‰) suggesting a longer below-ground foodchain in the grazed plots.

Comparative analyses have been made of the meteorological conditions over a period of years and of the yields of winter rye and spring wheat, and it has been possible to define those conditions which lead to the best yields in each. The influence of various cultural measures, rotations and other operations on moisture conservation has been studied by the Saratov institute. A number of new and improved varieties suitable for these conditions have been produced and are described The spring wheat Lutescens 15/12 is a product of complex hybridization, characterized by rapid development of the root system and rapid gain in dry weight in the developing grain; it is free from shedding, high in grain quality and exceeds Sarrubra in yield by up to 5 c. per ha. The spring wheat Albidum 43, the most drought resistant yet produced, is also a product of complex hybridization, and has a high rate of development of the primary and secondary roots, rapid filling of the grain and very uniform grain; it is free from shedding and has exceeded the standard by 2-2.5 c. per ha. in yield New spring wheats for irrigated land are Lutescens 605 and 758, and the best winter wheat yet produced is the rye-wheat hybrid Lutescens 230, distinguished by its winter hardiness, standing capacity, and large vitreous grains of high baking quality. Good results have been obtained with new varieties of other crops, such as Volzanka No. 7 winter rye; sunflowers with improved oil content such as Saratov No. 19, P-10, P4 and P-27, the last being a very early variety maturing in 77 days; and the millet Saratov Cream 311, characterized by a high extraction rate of 85%.

Thus, the objective of the present study is to measure arsenic content in different parts of rice and paddy soils, and eventually explain the arsenic distribution in ratoon rice, including its relationship to the soil. Arsenic levels of rice in grains, straws, roots, and soils were obtained from 15 rice paddies, selected based on different arsenic soil concentrations ranging from 67 to 438 mg kg(-1) (n = 15). The mean arsenic content in grains was measured at 0.20 mg kg(-1) (n = 60) and the highest grain arsenic of the survey was at 1.183 mg kg(-1). Meanwhile, the mean total arsenic levels were 244 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in root and 4.4 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in straw. In comparison, regression of topsoil arsenic levels with rice grains (r (2) = 0.00) and straws (r (2) = 0.56) were less significant compared to that with rice roots (r (2) = 0.93), and the mean arsenic level in rice from root to grain was also shown to have a decreasing trend. Though concentrations of arsenic in compositive rice grain each field did not exceed food hygiene concentration limit, arsenic level in root strongly depended on arsenic concentrations of soil suggesting that the high arsenic concentration may have the potential for translocation from root to grain which ultimately effects on the human health.","JAN  2015","2015-06-01 18:20:34","2015-06-01 22:00:52","","11-18","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000347290600002","","","","Arsenic; FPXRF; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; Soil contamination; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One area of potential is the modi. cation of cropping practices to increase soil carbon storage. Here, we report short-medium term changes in soil carbon under zero tillage cropping systems and perennial vegetation, both in a replicated field experiment and on nearby farmers' paddocks, on carbon-depleted Black Vertosols in the upper Liverpool Plains catchment. Soil organic carbon stocks (C(S)) remained unchanged under both zero tillage long fallow wheat-sorghum rotations and zero tillage continuous winter cereal in a replicated field experiment from 1994 to 2000. There was some evidence of accumulation of C(S) under intensive (>1 crop/year) zero tillage response cropping. There was significant accumulation of C(S) (similar to 0.35 Mg/ha.year) under 3 types of perennial pasture, despite removal of aerial biomass with each harvest. Significant accumulation was detected in the 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.4 m depth increments under lucerne and the top 2 increments under mixed pastures of lucerne and phalaris and of C3 and C4 perennial grasses. Average annual rainfall for the period of observations was 772 mm, greater than the 40-year average of 680 mm. A comparison of major attributes of cropping systems and perennial pastures showed no association between aerial biomass production and accumulation rates of C(S) but a positive correlation between the residence times of established plants and accumulation rates of C(S). C(S) also remained unchanged (1998/2000-07) under zero tillage cropping on nearby farms, irrespective of paddock history before 1998/2000 (zero tillage cropping, traditional cropping, or similar to 10 years of sown perennial pasture). These results are consistent with previous work in Queensland and central western New South Wales suggesting that the climate (warm, semi-arid temperate, semi-arid subtropical) of much of the inland cropping country in eastern Australia is not conducive to accumulation of soil carbon under continuous cropping, although they do suggest that C(S) may accumulate under several years of healthy perennial pastures in rotation with zero tillage cropping.","2009","2015-06-01 17:46:36","2015-06-01 17:46:36","","273-285","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000266305100004","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other achievements are sunflowers with high oil content and immunity to a number of diseases and pests, resulting from interspecific crosses. Of the 30 promising maize hybrids, a number are derived from male-sterile parents and corresponding wheat hybrids show yield increases of 30-40%; all the Triticum-Agropyron hybrids excel the standards in standing capacity and recent ones such as PPG391 and PPG56 yield over 40 c. per ha. without lodging; PPG172 is also resistant to drought, shedding and brown and yellow rust, yielding up to 55.4 c. per ha. under irrigation. The advantages of polyploidy are exemplified by triploid sugar beets, tetraploid rye and rye-wheat amphidiploids; three perennial Triticum-Agropyron hybrids give 2-3 yields without resowing and are resistant to frost and disease, though yielding less grain than the common wheat cultivars; a description is given of 1345, which, when sown in autumn, gives three crops of hay with a protein content of 12-14%, the total yield of which is 90-100 c., after which it can be grazed; other Triticum-Agropyron hybrids, with branching ears, contain over 100 grains per ear. A perennial rye, Pervenec [Firstborn], gives a crop in three successive years almost equal to that from normal rye. Incompatibility has been overcome in interspecific tobacco crosses by polyploidy, in crosses of cabbage with radish by grafting, which also induces flowering in the first year; an interspecific potato hybrid contains 23-5% starch and 3% protein; successful cultivars of pea and French bean have been produced by interspecific hybridization and others by crossing between ecotypes.","1967","2015-06-01 17:35:37","2015-06-01 22:30:49","","5-14","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19681601994","","","","search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preliminary communication.","Trudy Azovo-Cernomor. Selek-cent.","","","","","Sterility of the F 1 hybrids between Triticum and Agropyron is due to (1) frequent anomalies in pre-meiotic and mitotic divisions of the pollen mother-cells, (2) incomplete and casual conjugation of chromosomes, the number of bivalents varying from 0 to 2 ( T. durum X 28 chromo- some A. intermedium) to 19 to 23 ( T. vulgare x A. elongatum) and (3) irregular pollen-grain division. The degree of self-fertility varies however with parental forms; all hybrids between Triticum and A. intermedium are self-sterile, as are the hybrids between hard wheat and A.-elongatum, but a part of the hybrids between soft wheat and A. elongatum are self-fertile. The triple hybrids are relatively easily obtained by crossing F 1 to one of the parents. The data on the second generation concern chiefly the hybrids between wheat and A. intermedium, the majority of which were obtained by fusion of the male gametes with unreduced gametes of the F 1. Among sesquidiploids a forty-two chromosome plant was obtained, and among triple hybrids (F 1 X T. vulgare) forty-six and fifty-four chromosome plants were found; these plants resemble wheat, but they are perennial, Among F 2 plants (chiefly the triple hybrids) some lethal specimens with deficient chlorophyll were found. Both wheat sesquidiploids and those of couch grass are perennial and partly fertile. In reduction division of triple hybrids between T. dumm x 48 chromosome A. intermedium and A. vulgare, fourteen to twenty-one bivalents were counted and in the triple hybrid between T. durum X 48 chromosome A. intermedium and A. elongatum the number of bivalents was twenty-one. This suggests that the genomes A, B and D of wheats are homologous, though modified, with the respective Agropyron genomes. The Agropyron genomes X 1 and X 2 are not found in wheat; their relation to those of Aegilops has not yet been shown. The main trend of obtaining perennial wheat is thought to be through producing sesquidiploids which contain a haploid set of wheat and some Agropyron chromosomes. Fusion of these gametes will give plants with a diploid set of Triticum and Agropyron and a haploid set of Agropyron chromosomes; in these plants some of the Agropyron chromosomes will be univalents; selection of forms without univalents will give constant fertile forms. Triple hybrids might also give valuable forms, and finally obtaining amphidiploids by crossing wheat sesquidi-ploids with those of Agropyron should produce valuable forage plants.-M.A.O.","1936","2015-06-01 17:57:30","2015-06-01 17:57:30","","25-30","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19370700935","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These plants had chromosome numbers of 2n = 42, 14 chromosomes having been obtained from Triticum, 21 from Agropyron and seven from Secale. Root-tip nuclei at interphase showed the chromocentric structure characteristic of Secale. Meiotic behaviour was studied in one hybrid; the average metaphase configurations of 100 cells were 34.26 I + (2.95 IId + 0.08 IIa) + 0.56 III. There were 0.56 chiasmata per conjugated chromosome.

There was no apparent pairing between the chromosomes of Secale and those of the other two species; most of the chromosome associations arose from auto-syndesis of the Agropyron chromosomes. It was often possible to distinguish the Secale chromosomes amongst the univalents. Other aberrations typical of intergeneric hybrids were also observed.The hybrids were completely sterile even under conditions of open pollination. They showed great vigour; in their habit the hybrids resembled Agropyron from which they also inherited certain characteristics of the glume and the property of being perennial.

They are classified within the sub-family Pooideae and so are closely related to Brachypodium distachyon, wheat, barley, rye and oats. Recently, a DArT array has been developed which can be used in generating marker and mapping information for ryegrasses and fescues. This represents a potential common marker set for ryegrass and fescue researchers which can be linked through to comparative genomic information for the grasses.Results: A F2 perennial ryegrass genetic map was developed consisting of 7 linkage groups defined by 1316 markers and deriving a total map length of 683 cM. The marker set included 866 DArT and 315 gene sequence-based markers. Comparison with previous DArT mapping studies in perennial and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum) identified 87 and 105 DArT markers in common, respectively, of which 94% and 87% mapped to homoeologous linkage groups. A similar comparison with meadow fescue (F. pratensis) identified only 28 DArT markers in common, of which c. 50% mapped to non-homoelogous linkage groups. In L. perenne, the genetic distance spanned by the DArT markers encompassed the majority of the regions that could be described in terms of comparative genomic relationships with rice, Brachypodium distachyon, and Sorghum bicolor.Conclusions: DArT markers are likely to be a useful common marker resource for ryegrasses and fescues, though the success in aligning different populations through the mapping of common markers will be influenced by degrees of population interrelatedness. The detailed mapping of DArT and gene-based markers in this study potentially allows comparative relationships to be derived in future mapping populations characterised using solely DArT markers.","2013","2015-06-01 20:25:30","2015-06-02 02:05:15","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Comparative genomics; DArT Markers; Festuca; Genetic Maps; Lolium; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heavy depletion of winter sowings occurring yearly is the chief limiting factor in extension of the acreage sown with winter forms. With good management, the existing varieties will ensure a good crop; among agronomical measures, protection of sowings with snow is particularly important; it has been shown that under 50 cm. deep snow, temperatures at the depth of the tillering node do not fall below-2.4degreesC. when the surface temperature is about-22.6degreesC. Another important aspect is manuring which tends to increase carbohydrate content and thus the resistance of the plants, as well as regeneration of the parts damaged during winter. There is need for production of special Siberian varieties, in the breeding of which the vast resources in local peasant strains must be utilized; the method of training must also be used.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of six testing sites at a nine-degree slope were used in parallel to study five erosion control measures with one being the control site (no protection). Soil erosion rate was quantified using the erosion bridge method. Soil underlying the study area was analyzed for surface runoff potential. Precipitation was monitored using a Sigma rain gauge. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student Newman-Keuls Post-Hoc ANOVA analysis were conducted to evaluate statistical significance of erosion control effectiveness. Ratio of soil erosion rate reduction to cost of each control measure is also analyzed. Findings: All erosion control measures studied were very effective in reducing soil erosion for soils with high runoff potential, ranging from 75 percent to about 100 percent reduction in soil erosion rate. The most effective soil erosion protection was observed by Geojute fabric and Curlex blanket with greater than 90 percent reduction in soil erosion rate. However, after factoring-in cost, straw bedding was observed to be five times as cost-effective as Geojute fabric and Curlex blanket. The most cost-effective measure is temporary seeding using perennial rye grass. For each dollar spent, about 12 tons of soil per acre per year will be prevented from eroding.

"I5PJQH2P","journalArticle","1948","Anonymous","Again about distant hybridization and the wheat- Agropyron hybrids.","Selektsiya i semenovodstvo","","","","","The minutes are published of a conference of the Scientific Council of the Institute of Grain Farming of the Non-Black-Earth Belt held on 8 March 1948. The meeting was held as a protest against an article on N. V. Cicin's work by G. Andreev (cf. Abst, 1518). The editorial commentary on the dispute lends its support to Andreev. The resolution, which is signed by 20 members of the Scientific Council, may be summarized as follows. (1) The article by G. Andreev should be declared as libellous and misleading. (2) Accusations of Cicin and his colleagues of an anti-Micurinite direction in biology is due to misrepresentation. (3) Hybridization between cultivated and wild plants at the Institute has given new forms and varieties during a shorter period of time than ordinary breeding methods would have done. (4) Cicin and his colleagues have obtained by distant hybrid-ization, for the first time in history, a perennial wheat and several useful annual spring and winter wheat- Agropyron hybrids. These have either been released commercially or are undergoing State commercial tests. (5) The first form of perennial wheat, No. 34085, was obtained by Cicin in. 1935. Commercial tests in Kazahstan and Kirgizia have shown that the wheat can yield 2-3 harvests in succession without resowing. At the Kirgiz State Breeding Station, for instance, during the two growth periods, 1942 and 1943, four harvests were collected totalling 55.2 c.per ha. The wheat was discarded because of certain uneconomic characters. It has been replaced by new perennial wheats lacking the disadvantages of the original form. Among the best of these is wheat No. 2, which has been bred in the Moscow province. (6) A spring wheat-Agropyron hybrid, variety Flora -5, and a winter variety No. 599 are undergoing state tests. The winter variety No. 599 is superior in yields to standard varieties of the Novgorod, Leningrad, Tula and Kaluga provinces. (7) The Agropyron-wheat varieties 22850 and 23021 have been highly productive in commercial fanning. The promising spring Agropyron-wheat varieties Flora 6 and 7 and the winter hybrid varieties Nos 186, 4871, 64/45 and the squarehead No. 1/P have been submitted for testing. (8) The winter hybrids No. 599 and E-2493 are resistant to lodging and smut and their grain has good baking properties. (9) In the course of developing distant hybridization, the institute has made advances in the problems of polyploids, in rapprochment by grafting of intergeneric and other plants, and in methods of artificial preservation of hybrid embryos resulting from difficult distant crosses. It discovered the presence of gluten in the grain of barley, rye and other cereals and the application of the fact to breeding cereals. (10) The research institute has obtained new wheat, rye and barley hybrids with Elymus, Agropyron-rye hybrids, and the trigeneric hybrids, wheat x Agropyron x Elymus, wheat x Agropyron x rye, and wheat x rye x Elymus. (11) Some shortcomings of the work at the institute, mostly of an administrative nature, are pointed out. The attention is drawn of the Minister of Agriculture of the USSR, I. A. Benediktov, to Andreev's article. This has nothing in common with Soviet self criticism, but instead runs down outstanding discoveries of Soviet breeding and misleads the Soviet public. The main points of the editorial criticisms of Cicin and his colleagues are lack of practical results during 20 years of activity, due to formalism, Morganism and metaphysical conceptions; the absence of a perennial wheat in commercial production; misinterpretation of Micurin to suit formalist theories; and the use of colchicine methods and other ""chance"" methods of orthodox geneticists.","1948","2015-06-01 17:55:10","2015-06-01 17:55:10","","63-72","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19491602253","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the wide variety of vegetables, field and tree crops determined a high diversity and flexibility of agricultural enterprises. Despite these factors, Californian agroecosystems are dominated by monocultural cropping systems. Although productive, these systems lack the ecological features to ensure efficient nutrient cycling, water and soil conservation, and biotic regulation. Productivity is subsidized with chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers, some of which caue undesirable environmental and public health hazards. Large-scale monocultures are also highly susceptible to wind erosion and are dependent on ground water for irrigation, leading in some areas to a considerable ‘ leading in some areas to a considerable ‘overdraft’. In other regions, poor field drainage and rising water are leading to unacceptable soil salinity levels. In summary, Californian agriculture is very productive, but the environmental costs of such productivity is threatening the sustainability of agriculture. The search for self-sustaining, low-input, diversified and energy-efficient agricultural systems is now a major concern of researchers, farmers, policy makers and the public in California. The long tradition in biological pest control in California, as well as the experience of a number of organic farmers who developed low-input systems through ‘trial and error’, provide the building blocks for the search for a more sustainable agriculture. A key strategy is sustainable agriculture is to restore the agricultural diversity of the agricultural landscape. Diversity can be enhanced in lime through crop rotations and sequences, and in space in the form of cover crops, intercropping, agroforestry crop/livestock,mixturee, etc. Vegetation diversification not only results in pest regulation through restoration of natural controls, but also produces optimal nutrient recycling, energy conservation and less dependence on cultural inputs. In California although this new approach to agriculture is actively researched. realistically it will work only if it is economicically sensible and can be carried out within the constraints of a fairty normal agricultural system. Therefore, adoption of recommended diversification designs will procesd as these reduce costs and increase the efficiency and viability of farmers.","March 31, 1992","2015-06-01 19:25:35","2015-06-01 19:25:35","","23-53","","1–2","39","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

X Thinopyrum spp.) and perennial rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum) are novel hybrid species under development as alternatives to annual cereal crops. We conducted a 2-yr field study with a split plot design to evaluate agronomic performance, including yield, phenology, and biomass production, of perennial accessions of wheat and rye, along with annual analogs. This is one of the first studies to rigorously compare agronomic performance of 2-yr-old plants to 1-yr-old plants in perennial cereals. Perennial wheat produced 1.0 to 1.6 Mg ha(-1) grain yield, 50% of annual wheat (2.7 Mg ha(-1)), while perennial rye produced 1.3 Mg ha(-1), 73% of annual rye (1.8 Mg ha(-1)). Modest yields from perennials relative to annuals reflected lower harvest index, lower yield per tiller, and less kernel mass. One-year-old and 2-yr-old perennial plants had similar seed yields, yield components, and biomass production, indicating that plant age had little effect on these parameters and older plants maintained yield potential. In contrast, phenology did vary with plant age, and showed a shift toward earlier spring growth and later flowering dates in older perennial plants. This illustrates an expanded vegetative period for regrowing plants of these perennial cereals. There appears to be potential for producing an early season forage crop from these cereals, although biomass yields were not high at this site and regrowth was not always reliable. Overall, performance of perennial rye was consistent with a viable new cereal crop. On the other hand, perennial wheat requires further selection for allocation of biomass to grain and vigorous regrowth.","NOV-DEC  2012","2015-06-01 17:29:35","2015-06-01 22:31:16","","1716-1726","","6","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000310767200027","","","","Scopus; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typhoons, floods, and droughts caused 82.4% of the total Philippine rice losses from 1970 to 1990. In 1990 alone, domestic losses due to climatic constraints amounted to US$ 39.2 million. Weather aberrations, climatic fluctuations such as El Niño, and the growing concern for their effects on agriculture have stimulated academic, public and policy-level interests on the analysis of the impacts of climate variability on agricultural production systems. This paper is presented to discuss the agronomic impacts of climate variability on rice production in the Philippines. Long-term climate variability influences sowing date, crop duration, crop yield, and the management practices adapted in rice production. Short-term weather episodes can also affect yield by inducing changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and moisture availability. The degree of vulnerability of crops to climate variability depends mainly on the development stage of the crops at the time of weather aberration. The vulnerability and risk of crop production due to weather fluctuations and climate variability can be minimized if future weather variation can be adequately predicted and a suitable process-based ecophysiological crop yield forecasting model can be identified to produce real-time yield forecasts. Scientists and farmers must join efforts to further understand crop–climate relationships and formulate viable, locally adapted production technologies that will address critical issues such as climate variability.","December 2000","2015-06-01 19:38:50","2015-06-01 19:38:50","","129-137","","1–3","82","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate variability; El Niño; Philippines; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice production; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In dense sowings the length of stems was increased, but the length of leaves and ear was curtailed. At the same rate of seeding, sowings in furrows were superior to broadcast sowings. Among the methods of additional nutrition, fractional application of fertilizers during tillering, at the jointing phase and in the beginning of flowering, proved to be most effective.

It has been implicated most frequently with aggressive weeds in their interference with crops and less frequently with crops against weeds. Work in our laboratory has focused on the use of allelopathic crops or their residues for weed control. Screening of crop germplasm indicates that differential allelopathic potential exists within these collections. The most successful approach we have employed is to use allelopathic cereal grains in rotation with annual crops or in companion planting with perennial crops. Rye (Secale cereale L.) is an example of a plant which provides excellent weed suppression through both allelopathic and competitive mechanisms. Rye residues maintained on the soil surface release 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4(2H)-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) and a breakdown product 2(3H)-benzoxazalinone (BOA) both of which are strongly inhibitory to germination and seedling growth of dicoytylenous annual weeds. In addition, soil fungi convert BOA to 2,2'-oxo-1,1'-azo-benzene which is ten-fold more phytotoxic than BOA. Hence a variety of natural products contribute to the herbicidal activity of rye residues.","1990","2015-06-01 19:51:31","2015-06-01 19:51:31","","317-322","","","112","","UCLA symposia on molecular and cellular biology","Allelopathy","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.rye; SPV; TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","allelopathy; crop residues; crops; herbicidal properties; plant competition; weed control; weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ammonia losses at all application dates were investigated by an approach including passive flux samplers and a calibrated dynamic chamber method. Simultaneously a micrometeorological technique was used as a reference. A comparison of methods showed a close correlation (r2 = 0.92) between micromet and passive flux sampler techniques. Ammonia volatilization losses (on average 15% NH4+-N applied) occurred mainly within the first 10 h. Concomitant with high ammonia losses, a significant yield depression of 5 t DM ha−1 for ryegrass fertilized by biogas residues compared to CAN was observed. Little or no affect of biogas was observed for maize and wheat.

Non-repeatable genotype × environment (G × E) interactions are rarely analysed and interpreted further in sugarcane. The aim of this study was to use environmental characterisation and multivariate methods when non-repeatable interactions dominate to (i) illustrate and interpret the confounding crop-year effects in sugarcane and its contribution to non-repeatable G × E, (ii) investigate the nature and magnitude of G × E interactions, and (iii) gain insights into test site similarities in the coastal region of South Africa to improve the efficiencies of the testing network. Variation in estimated recoverable crystal yield was larger for non-repeatable components compared to repeatable components in eight out of ten planting series. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) biplots illustrated the differential genotype interactions with crop-years of the same trial. Principal components analysis (PCA) illustrated how crop-years clustered together on biplots in response to key environmental covariates derived from climatic data and crop growth models. Based on interpretations using integrated multivariate methods, it is hypothesised that non-repeatable G × E interactions may be larger in autumn compared to spring harvests. AMMI biplots for individual crop-years showed that site T2 is redundant, and should be removed from the trial network without loss of information. Integrated environmental characterisation and multivariate visual appraisals are proposed as alternatives to understanding non-repeatable G × E when crop and year effects cannot be separated experimentally. Hypotheses generated through visual appraisals should be subsequently tested quantitatively.","February 15, 2014","2015-06-01 19:39:22","2015-06-01 19:39:22","","57-64","","0","157","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental covariate; Genotype × environment; Multivariate analyses; Non-repeatable G × E; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Sugarcane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CsZfp encoded a putative protein of 173 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 18.44 kDa, an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.50 and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) value of − 0.334. The gene did not have an intron, and belonged to a multi-gene family. During the period of active growth (PAG), CsZfp showed maximum expression in root and fruit as compared to leaf, floral bud and stem. Interaction studies between temperature and plant growth regulators on the expression of CsZfp showed that ABA upregulated CsZfp expression at growth temperature (GT; 25 °C) but had no effect at low temperature (LT; 4 °C). In response to GA3, upregulation was observed at LT but not at GT. Further, the expression was not modulated by LT either in the tissue harvested during PAG or during WD. It was interesting to record that the expression of CsZfp was upregulated by hydrogen peroxide and sodium chloride, whereas it was non-responsive to polyethylene glycol. The possible role of CsZfp in playing key but differential roles in tea to various abiotic stresses is discussed.","March 2015","2015-06-01 19:24:03","2015-06-01 19:24:03","","1-7","","0","1","","Plant Gene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein; Camellia sinensis; CsZfp; Gene expression; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Winter dormancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S.","Analysis of a grain reserve plan.","[Publication] Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture","","","","","This paper develops a specific proposal for grain reserves. By examining past experiences and the evolving role of the US in world grain markets, it identifies four purposes of reserves. First, grain reserves should function like shock absorbers - rising and falling as needed - rather than as a perennial grain inventory insulating the US from events in world markets. Second, reserves should be carefully insulated from the market to avoid premature release on the one hand and distortions of market forces on the other. Third, reserves should be held to meet needs arising from inevitable but unforeseeable fluctuations in supply and demand. Finally, governmental actions should be limited to eliminate needless uncertainties. A reserves proposal meeting these standards would include the following provisions: agreement on specific total carryover objectives; acreage adjustments to bring actual carryover levels to these objectives; government ownership of a specific proportion of total carryover objectives; governmental acquisition and release of stocks at specific, known prices separated by a wide band.","1976","2015-06-01 17:20:34","2015-06-01 17:20:34","","157-173","","ERS-634","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19781849935","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tobacco is criticized because it causes health problems to its consumers and because production causes environmental damage such as soil degradation, deforestation and water pollution. Diversification has been indicated as the strategy for a sustainable economic development for farmers. In the specific case of Valle de Lerma, many years of continuous tobacco mono-cropping, excessive ploughing and poor irrigation control have caused soil degradation of the land used for tobacco. Tobacco farming in Salta also entails a production and a price risk which is increasing because of uncertainty surrounding governmental subsidies. The objective of this article is to assess the impact of diversification on expected farm income, income risk and soil organic matter (as an indicator of soil degradation) on specialized tobacco farms. To reach this objective, a quadratic programming model of a typical specialized tobacco farm is developed. Soil organic matter is included in the model by means of the concept of the carbon balance. The carbon balance is the difference between carbon supply and carbon decline in a year. Two different situations with respect to soil degradation are evaluated using the model. The current situation includes no restriction on carbon balance while the desired situation includes the restriction that the carbon balance cannot be negative. So farmers’ choices are valuated with and without carbon balance constraints. The model results for the current situation show that, no matter which risk attitude is used, the maximum area of land given irrigation possibilities is devoted to tobacco, while the rest of the land is assigned to the non-irrigated crop soybean. The carbon balance is negative and soil continues to degrade. In the desired situation, tobacco and soybean are partly replaced by bull beef production (including the production of alfalfa and maize for silage) to fulfill the requirement of a no negative carbon balance. As the risk aversion coefficient in this situation increases, the low risk crop chickpea enters the solution and bull beef decreases. The requirement of no further soil degradation comes at a high cost since gross margin of the farm is decreased by some 35% compared to the current situation. Finally, the model is used to explore the effects of an abolishment of governmental subsidies on tobacco. In this situation the production plan consists of soybean, bull beef and tobacco in such a proportion that the carbon balance is positive. Income effects of an abolishment of governmental subsidies on tobacco would be large as the gross margin of the farm decreases by some 60%.","June 2014","2015-06-01 19:24:17","2015-06-01 19:24:17","","35-43","","0","128","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Income risk; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Quadratic risk programming; Risk aversion; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil degradation; SPV; Tobacco diversification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we performed a QTL analysis for yield and yield-component traits of an F2 population based on data from replicated field trials over 2 years using vegetative shoots of ratooned plants, making use of the ratooning habit of rice. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of conducting QTL analyses directly based on an F2 population by means of ratooning plants. The experimental population was from a cross between 'Zhenshan 97' and 'Minghui 63', the parents of 'Shanyou 63', an elite rice hybrid widely grown in China. A genetic linkage map containing 151 molecular markers was constructed for QTL mapping. A total of 20 distinct QTLs were detected; eight of these were detected in both years and remaining 12 in only 1 year.

In this study, we performed a QTL analysis for yield and yield-component traits of an F-2 population based on data from replicated field trials over 2 years using vegetative shoots of ratooned plants, making use of the ratooning habit of rice. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of conducting QTL analyses directly based on an F-2 population by means of ratooning plants. The experimental population was from a cross between 'Zhenshan 97' and 'Minghui 63', the parents of 'Shanyou 63', an elite rice hybrid widely grown in China. Agenetic linkage map containing 151 molecular markers was constructed for QTL I napping. A total of 20 distinct QTLs were detected. eight of these were detected in both years and remaining 12 in only 1 year. Compared with the results of our previous analysis of the F-2:3 families from the same cross, it was shown that most of the QTLs detected in the ratooned F-2 population were also detected in the F-2:3 population. However, the estimates of both additive and dominant types of genetic effects for many of the QTLs based on F-2 ratoons were substantially larger than those based on F-2:3 families.

The crop was grown at two spacings as it was expected that crop density could interact with the crop's ability to extract soil moisture. The irrigation treatment received furrow irrigation four times during the 1990/91 and 1992/93 seasons and twice during the 1991/92 season. Grain yields of all genotypes were 11% higher when planted at higher density than at low density. There was a differential variation in yield and harvest index among genotypes due to season but not due to spacing and irrigation suggesting the validity of the present approach of testing genotypes under optimum conditions. Grain yield declined by 21% from the 1990 to 1992 season. The decline was >1 t/ha in some cultivars (ICPL 366, GW3), and between 0.5 and 1.0 t/ha in others (NP (WR) 15, ICP 87143 and ICPL 84072). In others (Bahar, ICP 9174, ICP 8860) the yield fluctuation was <0.5 t/ha. The genotypes' mean yields were as high as 2.7 t/ha for ICPL 87143, ICPL 84072 and ICPL 366. There was a significant reduction in both grain yield (16%), and also aboveground plant dry mass (18%) due to soil moisture limitation in the unirrigated treatment. Both the aboveground plant dry mass and grain yields were significantly more at high plant density than at lower plant density especially with irrigation. The genotypes were found to differ in their response to production environment (irrigation, spacing and to the undefined differences of the 3 years). Genotypic variation in yield within a production environment was found to vary in relation to changes in harvest index and across environment (irrigation, seasons) due to variation in total dry matter production. A lack of negative relationship between the total dry matter and harvest index suggests the possibility of optimizing both for obtaining higher yield from long-duration genotypes.","2001","2015-06-01 17:15:33","2015-06-01 21:46:31","","291-299","","3","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20013062750","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.grain; search.pigeonpea; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (""long duration"" W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (""long duration"" N1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon#pea"")); WOS","Cajanus cajan; crop production; crop yield; genetic variation; genotype; India; irrigation; seasonal variation; soil chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herbage from the primary regrowth of predominantly perennial rye-grass swards received either 72 (LN), 126 (MN) or 180 (HN) kg N ha-1. The herbages were harvested and yield estimated after a 50-day regrowth interval. After storage for 24 h in polythene bags, the herbages were ensiled, unwilted, in laboratory silos (6 kg capacity) either untreated (UT) or treated with formic acid (F) at 3 ml (kg herbage)-1 . Three silos per treatment were opened and sampled on days 1. 3, 6, 15, 50 and 105 after ensiling. The mean herbage yields for the LN, MN and HN swards were 5.2, 6.3 and 6.2 (s.e. = 0.27) t DM ha-1 and there was no carryover effect of nitrogen treatment on the yield of a subsequent 22-day regrowth harvested on 2 September. As level of fertilizer N application increased, concentrations in the herbage at mowing of crude protein, nitrate and ash increased, DM decreased and water-soluble carbohydrate and in vitro DM digestibility remained unchanged. Increasing the rate of N fertilizer to the sward resulted in higher silage pH (P&lt;0.001) and ammonia N concentrations (P &lt; 0.001) at each time of sampling. Increasing the rate of fertilizer N increased effluent output (P &lt; 0.001) and DM recovery (P&lt;0.001). Aerobic stability was improved (P &lt; 0.001) by use of high rates of N fertilizer application. Formic acid treatment restricted fermentation and increased effluent output (P&lt;0.001) but had no effect (P&gt;0.05) on DM recovery. It is concluded that the rate and extent of pH decline was reduced with increasing N application, associated with increased buffering capacity and decreased DM concentrations of the herbage at ensiling. However, increasing the level of N fertilizer applied increased DM recovery and effluent output, and improved aerobic stability of the resulting silages.","1996","2015-06-01 20:31:10","2015-06-01 20:31:10","","350-362","","4","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying the biochemical and physiological responses of plants with different capacities to deal with stress is a valid approach to reach this objective. Lotus corniculatus (lotus) and Trifolium pratense (clover) are legumes with contrasting summer stress tolerances. In stress conditions, which are defined as drought, heat or a combination of both, we found that differential biochemical responses of leaves explain these behaviours. Lotus and clover showed differences in water loss control, proline accumulation and antioxidant enzymatic capacity. Drought and/or heat stress induced a large accumulation of proline in the tolerant species (lotus), whereas heat stress did not cause proline accumulation in the sensitive species (clover). In lotus, Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD were induced by drought, but in clover, the SOD-isoform profile was not affected by stress. Moreover, lotus has more SOD-isoforms and a higher total SOD activity than clover. The functionality and electrophoretic profile of photosystem II (PSII) proteins under stress also exhibited differences between the two species. In lotus, PSII activity was drastically affected by combined stress and, interestingly, was correlated with D2 protein degradation. Possible implications of this event as an adaption mechanism in tolerant species are discussed. We conclude that the stress-tolerant capability of lotus is related to its ability to respond to oxidative damage and adaption of the photosynthetic machinery. This reveals that these two aspects should be included in the evaluation of the tolerance of species to stress conditions.","September 2013","2015-06-01 19:23:55","2015-06-01 19:23:55","","195-203","","0","70","","Plant Physiology and Biochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heat stress; Lotus corniculatus; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Photoinhibition; Proline; PSII proteins; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Trifolium pratense; Water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted at the Research farm of the Central Soil and Water Conservation and Training Institute in Chandigarh, Haryana, India. Studies on soil loss, runoff and nutrient losses for a decade showed that Emblica officinalis+ Chrysopogon fulvus was the best silvopastoral system for soil conservation in the region and resulted in 65 and 81% reduction in runoff and soil loss, respectively. The corresponding values were 43 and 56, and 19 and 25% for aonla+hybrid napier and aonla+pigeon pea systems, respectively. Aonla+ Chrysopogon also proved to be the most effective system in reducing nutrient losses and led to 68, 66 and 68% reduction in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium losses, respectively, over pure aonla plantation. These systems saved rain water, soil, N, P 2O 5 and K 2O in the range of 4.88 to 30.66 cm, 862-2818 kg ha -1, 3.8-11.0 kg ha -1, 0.005-0.024 kg ha -1 and 0.57-1.98 kg ha -1, respectively, over sole aonla plantation. Effectiveness of aonla+hybrid napier and aonla+pigeon pea in conserving the resources decreased in the post-bearing stage while that of aonla+ Chrysopogon showed reverse (increasing) trend.

The aim of this paper was to critically evaluate use of gas production (GP) data as inputs to current feed evaluation systems, as well as to mechanistic rumen models. Topics discussed include prediction of rumen degradation of feed, efficiency of microbial synthesis, and the profile of volatile fatty acids (VFA) produced. Derivation of GP models to permit calculation of extent of degradation of organic matter (OM) has been of great value, as well as to reveal assumptions underlying models to analyse GP data. Gas production techniques (GPT) have good potential to predict rumen OM degradation, in particular through provision of kinetic information, but the potential to provide parameters of degradation of OM components seems limited. Optimal use of GP data to predict microbial efficiency and VFA formed is best achieved when the possibilities, and limitations, of batch culture GPT are recognised. The mechanisms governing microbial efficiency and VFA molar proportions in the GPT are not necessarily applicable to in vivo situations. A simple model based on classic microbial growth and substrate utilisation equations for batch cultures is used to illustrate the need to carefully interpret microbial efficiency in batch culture for use in in vivo situations. The profile of VFA in GPTs is only a reflection of the dynamic VFA profile in vivo. Of crucial importance for estimation of OM degradation, microbial efficiency and amount and type of VFA formed is knowledge of the fractional passage rate of ingesta from the rumen. The value of the GPT is greatly enhanced in combination with mechanistic modelling. However, the role of the technique is not in giving direct predictions of nutrient supply.","September 30, 2005","2015-06-01 19:25:25","2015-06-01 19:25:25","","561-578","","0","123–124, Part 1","","Animal Feed Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gas production; Mathematical modelling; Microbial efficiency; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rumen; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Substrate degradation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The profitability that might be expected from perennial wheat of different types was investigated using MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System), a bioeconomic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. Although perennial wheat may produce a lower grain yield and quality than annual wheat, it is expected inputs of fertiliser, herbicide and sowing costs will be lower. Perennial wheat used solely for grain production was not selected as part of an optimal farm plan under the standard assumptions. In contrast, dual-purpose perennial wheat that produces grain and additional forage during summer and autumn than annual wheat can increase farm profitability substantially (AU$20/ha over the whole farm) and 20% of farm area was selected on the optimal farm plan under standard assumptions. Forage from perennial wheat replaced stubble over summer and grain supplement at the break of season and increased farm stock numbers. The additional value added by grazing also reduced the relative yield required for perennial wheat to be profitable. This analysis suggests perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers.","March 2008","2015-06-01 19:35:04","2015-06-01 22:32:51","","166-174","","1–3","96","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Benefit–cost; Benefit-cost; Dual-purpose; MIDAS; Perennial crop; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Profitability; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; Sustainability; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","Australia; cost benefit analysis; dryland farming; profitability; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These agricultural regimes represent ecosystems controlled to large degree by agricultural practices, and can be shown to produce different weed flora assemblages. In order to reconstruct early rice cultivation systems it is necessary to better establish how ancient rice farming practices may be seen using archaeobotanical data. This paper focuses on using modern analogue phytolith assemblages of associated crop weeds found within cultivation regimes, as well as in wild rice stands (unplanted stands of Oryza nivara or Oryza rufipogon), as a means of interpreting archaeobotanical assemblages. Rice weeds and sediment samples have been recorded and collected from a range of arable systems and wild stands in India. The husks, leaves and culms of associated weeds were processed for phytolith reference samples, and sediment samples were processed for phytoliths in order to establish patterns identifiable to specific systems. The preliminary results of the phytolith analysis of samples from these modern fields demonstrate that phytolith assemblage statistics show correlation with variation in rice cultivation systems on the basis of differences in environmental conditions and regimes, with wetness being one major factor. Analysis of phytoliths from archaeological samples from contrasting systems in Neolithic China and India demonstrate how this method can be applied to separate archaeological regions and periods based on inferred differences in past agricultural practices, identifying wet cultivation systems in China, dry millet-dominated agriculture of north China and rainfed/dry rice in Neolithic India.","November 2014","2015-06-01 19:21:43","2015-06-01 19:21:43","","43-53","","0","51","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Cultivation systems; India; Neolithic; Oryza sativa; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Plant opals; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successful revegetation of invaded-plant communities can be prohibitively expensive because it often requires iterative applications of integrated control and revegetation treatments. Prescribed burning has been used to control medusahead and prepare seedbeds for revegetation, but burning has been constrained by liability concerns and has produced widely varying results. Capitalizing on naturally occurring wildfires could reduce revegetation costs and alleviate liability concerns. Thus, our objective was to determine if early summer wildfires and fall drill seeding could be used as a treatment combination to decrease medusahead and increase perennial and native vegetation. Treatments were evaluated pretreatment and for 3 yr postfire at six sites and included 1) an early summer wildfire combined with a seeding treatment (burn and seed) and 2) a nontreated (no burn, no seed) control. Perennial grass density was 4.6- to 10.0-fold greater in the burn-and-seed treatment compared to the control in the first 3 yr posttreatment (P &lt; 0.05). Exotic annual grass density and cover in the third year posttreatment were lower in the burn-and-seed treatment than in the control (P &lt; 0.05). However, exotic annual grass density was still &gt; 130 individuals · m‒2 in the burn-and-seed treatment. The density of exotic annual grass is of concern because over time medusahead may displace perennial grasses and annual forbs that increased with the burn-and-seed treatment. Though not directly tested in this study, we suggest that, based on other research, the burn-and-seed treatment may need to incorporate a preemergent herbicide application to further suppress medusahead and increase the establishment of seeded vegetation. However, it appears that early summer wildfires may provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of integrated programs to revegetate medusahead-invaded plant communities.","March 2013","2015-06-01 19:23:05","2015-06-01 19:23:05","","234-240","","2","66","","Rangeland Ecology & Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","invasive plants; medusahead; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); restoration; sagebrush; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Taeniatherum caput-medusae; Weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last three decades, however, farming practices and management systems have been intensified in many rice-producing countries. In addition, more recent socioeconomic changes have caused agricultural abandonment in some parts of East and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan. This study reviewed long-term statistics on rice farming, as well as the impact of agricultural intensification and abandonment on farmland biodiversity at multiple spatial scales in Japan. The impact of pesticide use was greatest in the 1950s–1970s, when the use of highly toxic agents had not yet been prohibited. More recently, different components of agricultural intensification have been the largest threat for various taxa, for example, chemical pesticides for aquatic plants and invertebrates and modern efficient irrigation/drainage systems for amphibians, fishes, and waterbirds. The negative impacts of agricultural abandonment on farmland species have been rapidly increasing with the expansion of abandoned fields and the subsequent vegetation succession and loss of habitat heterogeneity. We also discuss the effectiveness of environmentally friendly farming practices, including the reduced use of pesticides, winter paddy flooding, and installation of fishways, to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on farmland species in rice-paddy landscapes.","January 2015","2015-06-01 19:22:41","2015-06-01 19:22:41","","73-84","","0","132","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Abandonment; Agricultural modernization; Agri-environmental schemes; Farmland biodiversity; Habitat heterogeneity; Organic farming; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a method to map annual LULC at a regional spatial scale with source data and processing techniques that permit scaling to broader spatial and temporal scales, while maintaining a consistent classification scheme and accuracy. Using the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay as a test site, we derived a suite of predictor variables from 2001 to 2007 from the MODIS 250 m vegetation index product (MOD13Q1). These variables included: annual statistics of red, near infrared, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenological metrics derived from EVI time series data, and slope and elevation. For reference data, we visually interpreted percent cover of eight classes at locations with high-resolution QuickBird imagery in Google Earth. An adjustable majority cover threshold was used to assign samples to a dominant class. When compared to field data, we found this imagery to have georeferencing error &lt; 5% the length of a MODIS pixel, while most class interpretation error was related to confusion between agriculture and herbaceous vegetation. We used the Random Forests classifier to identify the best sets of predictor variables and percent cover thresholds for discriminating our LULC classes. The best variable set included all predictor variables and a cover threshold of 80%. This optimal Random Forests was used to map LULC for each year between 2001 and 2007, followed by a per-pixel, 3-year temporal filter to remove disallowed LULC transitions. Our sequence of maps had an overall accuracy of 79.3%, producer accuracy from 51.4% (plantation) to 95.8% (woody vegetation), and user accuracy from 58.9% (herbaceous vegetation) to 100.0% (water). We attributed map class confusion to limited spectral information, sub-pixel spectral mixing, georeferencing error and human error in interpreting reference samples. We used our maps to assess woody vegetation change in the Dry Chaco from 2002 to 2006, which was characterized by rapid deforestation related to soybean and planted pasture expansion. This method can be easily applied to other regions or continents to produce spatially and temporally consistent information on annual LULC.","November 15, 2010","2015-06-01 19:25:11","2015-06-01 19:25:11","","2816-2832","","11","114","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dry Chaco ecoregion; Google Earth interpretation; Land cover and land use change; MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Random Forests; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Time series analysis; Vegetation phenology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparative studies of sRNAs from plants have mainly focused on miRNA, even though they constitute a mere fraction of the total sRNA diversity. In this study, we report results from an in-depth analysis of the sRNA population from the conifer spruce (Picea abies) and compared the results with those of a range of plant species. The vast majority of sRNA sequences in spruce can be assigned to 21-nucleotide-long siRNA sequences, of which a large fraction originate from the degradation of transcribed sequences related to nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat-type resistance genes. Over 90% of all genes predicted to contain either a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor or nucleotide-binding site domain showed evidence of siRNA degradation. The data further suggest that this phased degradation of resistance-related genes is initiated from miRNA-guided cleavage, often by an abundant 22-nucleotide miRNA. Comparative analysis over a range of plant species revealed a huge variation in the abundance of this phenomenon. The process seemed to be virtually absent in several species, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and nonvascular plants, while particularly high frequencies were observed in spruce, grape (Vitis vinifera), and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). This divergent pattern might reflect a mechanism to limit runaway transcription of these genes in species with rapidly expanding nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat gene families. Alternatively, it might reflect variation in a counter-counter defense mechanism between plant species.","JUN  2013","2015-06-01 17:26:07","2015-06-01 17:26:07","","741-754","","2","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000319819900017","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ratoon ratio, defined as seed harvested after the first flush harvest as a proportion of total seed yield of all flushes, was found to be highly environment-dependent, confirming that large-plot trials are more suitable for this purpose.","1991","2015-06-01 18:19:24","2015-06-01 18:19:24","","15-17","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19921634066","","","","search.pigeonpea; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study investigated the efficiency of association of susceptible and resistant varieties in reducing leaf and neck blast and increasing yield. Two sets of experiments were conducted in fields with associations through using different proportions of resistant variety, and two types of susceptible variety (moderately and very susceptible) in the association. The efficiency of the association was measured by comparing disease intensity and yield in the variety when grown in association and when grown as a pure stand. ANOVAs and logistic regressions indicated that resistant-susceptible variety association was more efficient in reducing neck blast than leaf blast. Associations were more efficient (1) when the proportion of resistant variety was increased, (2) when a moderately susceptible variety was used instead of a very susceptible variety, and (3) when disease level in the pure stand was higher. Associations did not penalize the performances of the resistant variety, neither in terms of disease intensity, nor yield. Logistic regressions allowed to estimate the probability of a given association to reduce disease (or to increase yield) above a preset threshold, according to the proportion of resistant variety and to the type of susceptible variety.","April 2010","2015-06-01 19:23:17","2015-06-01 19:23:17","","390-400","","4","29","","Crop Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Blast; Disease-management; Host genetic diversity; Magnaporthe oryzae; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plant Sci. 91: 545-551. Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is a serious threat to canola (Brassica napus, B. rapa) production in western Canada because of its long-lived resting spores, high spore production potential, and negative impact on seed yield when inoculum concentrations are high. The impact of bait crops on soil resting spore populations and subsequent clubroot severity was studied in replicated trials under greenhouse and field conditions. Resting spore populations were often slightly reduced following two cycles of cruciferous crops (canola or Chinese cabbage) relative to non-cruciferous host crops (red clover, perennial ryegrass, orchardgrass, bentgrass) and non-host crops (barley, wheat). Subsequent clubroot severity showed a similar trend, but the impact was generally small and inconsistent. Bait crops had no effect on clubroot severity at two commercial field sites where populations of resting spores were high (1 x 10(6) spores per gram of soil). We conclude that the use of bait crops is unlikely to be an important component of an IPM program for clubroot of canola.","MAY  2011","2015-06-01 17:46:10","2015-06-01 17:46:10","","545-551","","3","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000290837700013","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ex. Kurtz. from Southern Western Ghats of India were assessed using RAPD markers reserpine content and morphological traits. An estimate of genetic diversity and differentiation between genotypes of breeding germplasm is of key importance for its improvement. Populations were collected from different geographical regions. Data obtained through three different methods were compared and the correlation among them was estimated. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for all horticultural characteristics among the accessions suggesting that selection for relevant characteristics could be possible. Variation in the content of Reserpine ranges from 0.192 g/100 g (population from Tusharagiri) to 1.312 g/100 g (population from Aryankavu). A high diversity within population and high genetic differentiation among them based on RAPDs were revealed caused both by habitat fragmentation of the low size of most populations and the low level of gene flow among them. The UPGMA dendrogram and PCA analysis based on reserpine content yielded higher separation among populations indicated specific adaptation of populations into clusters each of them including populations closed to their geographical origin. Genetic, chemical and morphological data were correlated based on Mantel test. Given the high differentiation among populations conservation strategies should take into account genetic diversity and chemical variation levels in relation to bioclimatic and geographic location of populations. Our results also indicate that RAPD approach along with horticultural analysis seemed to be best suited for assessing with high accuracy the genetic relationships among distinct R. serpentina accessions.","January 2014","2015-06-01 19:24:31","2015-06-01 19:24:31","","46-60","","0","92","","Fitoterapia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity conservation; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); RAPD; Rauvolfia serpentina Benth.

An ultrasonic sensor was used to determine sward heights. Forage mass–height relationships were evaluated by carrying out static measurements on binary legume–grass mixtures of white clover (Trifolium repens L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) with perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne L.) across a wide range of sward heights (5.0–104.2 cm) and forage mass (0.15–11.25 t ha−1). Mobile measurements, hereafter referred to as “on-the-go” were conducted by mounting the ultrasonic sensor in combination with a high-precision Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) on a vehicle. Data were recorded along experimental plots consisting of perennial rye grass and grass–clover mixtures similar to the mixtures that were used for the static experiment. The static experiment revealed a relationship between ultrasonic sward height and forage mass explaining 74.8% of the variance with a standard error (SE) of 1.05 t ha−1 in a common dataset. The type of legume species, weed proportion, and growth period had a significant impact on the above mentioned relationship. Legume-specific regression functions had higher R2-values of up to 0.855 (white clover mixture). Datasets including legume-specific mixtures and pure swards of both components reached comparable R2 values between 0.799 and 0.818 but exhibited higher SE values. The abundance of weeds resulted in increased ultrasonic sward heights for the same levels of forage mass. On-the-go measurements across experimental field plots yielded a sward height range of 1.4–70.4 cm. Abrupt forage mass changes at the transition from treatment plots to cut interspaces resulted in a significant deviation from stubble height within a distance of 50 cm to plot borders. When legume-specific equations derived from static measurements were applied to sward heights, forage mass was overestimated by 21.4% on average. Mean residuals from predicted forage mass ranged between 0.893 (pure grass) and 1.672 (red clover mixture) and increased significantly if the point sampling distance along the track was increased to more than 0.82 m on average across all plots. The prediction accuracy of forage mass from ultrasonic height measurements is promising; however, further modifications to the technique are necessary. One such improvement can be the use of spectral reflectance signatures in combination with the ultrasonic sensor.","November 2011","2015-06-01 19:32:55","2015-06-01 22:34:46","","142-152","","2","79","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Forage mass; Grassland; On-the-go; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; Sward height; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass""); Ultrasonic sensor; Yield maps","alfalfa; data collection; equations; field experimentation; forage; grasses; grasslands; Lolium perenne; Medicago sativa; prediction; reflectance; rye; stubble; sward; Trifolium pratense; Trifolium repens; variance; weeds; yield mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a few genotypes, ratoon yield constituted 50% of the total yield, which could be as high as 5-6 t/ha. Total ratoon yield was positively correlated with leaf area index in the last 2 years of experimentation. The relationship of total ratoon yield to main crop yield was significantly positive in 1991/92 only.

Objectives: The objectives were to estimate the percentage of asthma cases in the US population attributable to atopy and to examine associations between allergen-specific skin tests and asthma. Methods: Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which subjects age 6 to 59 years were skin tested with 10 allergens. Atopy was defined as at least 1 positive allergen-specific test. Doctor-diagnosed current asthma was assessed by questionnaire. Results: In the United States, 56.3% of the asthma cases were attributable to atopy, and that percentage was greater among males than females, among persons in the highest education category than in lower education categories, and among persons living in highly populated metropolitan areas than in all other areas. Each allergen-specific test was strongly associated with asthma before adjustment (odds ratios varied from 2.1 to 4.5); however, after adjustment by all the allergens, only tests to cat, Alternaria, white oak, and perennial rye were independently associated with asthma. Perennial rye was inversely associated with asthma. Of the 10 allergens, a positive response to cat accounted for the highest percentage of asthma cases (29.3%). Conclusion: About half of the current asthma cases in the US population represented by the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were attributable to atopy. Some allergen-specific skin tests were not independently associated with asthma. Clinical implications: If atopy could be prevented or reversed, or its effect on asthma blocked, then a large percentage of asthma cases in the US population could be prevented.","2007","2015-06-01 17:30:07","2015-06-01 22:35:55","","1139-1145","","5","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20073286166","","","","allergens; allergic sensitization; allergy skin test; asthma; atopy; epidemiology; NHANES III; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; search.rye; skin prick test; SPV; survey; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a dynamic, stochastic, purposeful system, sustainability is defined as its ability to continue into the future. It can be expressed as the probability of continuation within specified threshold boundaries through a specified future period. Long-term, stochastic simulation of a system model serves as a basis for quantifying sustainability. Hypothesized constraints to sustainability can be tested and ranked by sensitivity analysis. Issues that arise when applying the framework to a particular farm include selecting an appropriate time frame, making assumptions about the future behaviour of system inputs, specifying criteria for system failure, and identifying potential determinants of sustainability. A previously published simulation study of Texas rice farms illustrates elements of the proposed approach.","June 1996","2015-06-01 19:39:50","2015-06-01 19:39:50","","185-201","","2","51","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Red rice (Oryza longistaminata) is a perennial wild rice species with many valuable traits that could be used to improve cultivated rice cultivars, including rhizomatousness, disease resistance and drought tolerance. Despite these features, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhizome growth, development and function in this plant. Results: We used an integrated approach to compare the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the rhizome to other tissues of red rice. 116 Gb of transcriptome sequence was obtained from various tissues and used to identify rhizome-specific and preferentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches identified 41 proteins and more than 100 primary metabolites and plant hormones with rhizome preferential accumulation. Of particular interest was the identification of a large number of gene transcripts from Magnaportha oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast disease in cultivated rice, even though the red rice plants showed no sign of disease. Conclusions: A significant set of genes, proteins and metabolites appear to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the rhizome of O. longistaminata. The presence of M. oryzae gene transcripts at a high level in apparently healthy plants suggests that red rice is resistant to this pathogen, and may be able to provide genes to cultivated rice that will enable resistance to rice blast disease.","FEB 12  2014","2015-06-01 17:25:59","2015-06-01 22:36:54","","46","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000335059200001","","","","Disease resistance; Invasive species; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Rhizome; Rice; Rice blast; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Transcriptomics; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Domestication involved selection of traits that are desirable for agriculture and to human consumers. Wild relatives of crop plants are a source of useful variation which is of immense value for crop improvement. Australian wild rices have been isolated from the impacts of domestication in Asia and represents a source of novel diversity for global rice improvement. Oryza rufipogon is a perennial wild progenitor of cultivated rice. Oryza meridionalis is a related annual species in Australia. Results: We have examined the sequence of the genomes of AA genome wild rices from Australia that are close relatives of cultivated rice through whole genome re-sequencing. Assembly of the resequencing data to the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare shows that Australian wild rices possess 2.5 times more single nucleotide polymorphisms than in the Asian wild rice and cultivated O. sativa ssp. indica. Analysis of the genome of domesticated rice reveals regions of low diversity that show very little variation (polymorphism deserts). Both the perennial and annual wild rice from Australia show a high degree of conservation of sequence with that found in cultivated rice in the same 4.58Mbp region on chromosome 5, which suggests that some of the 'polymorphism deserts' in this and other parts of the rice genome may have originated prior to domestication due to natural selection. Conclusions: Analysis of genes in the 'polymorphism deserts' indicates that this selection may have been due to biotic or abiotic stress in the environment of early rice relatives. Despite having closely related sequences in these genome regions, the Australian wild populations represent an invaluable source of diversity supporting rice food security.","2014","2015-06-01 20:25:20","2015-06-02 02:05:07","","","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown under ambient CO2 or FACE (ambient + 200 μmol mol−1 CO2) conditions throughout the growth season. Low N (LN) and normal N (NN) were applied, LN being 150 kg ha−1 for rice and 125 kg ha−1 for wheat and NN being 250 kg ha−1 for both rice and wheat. Compared with the ambient [CO2] condition, elevated [CO2] significantly increased crop biomass and P uptake for both rice and wheat and N uptake only for wheat at several main growth stages. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on biomass, N and P uptake of wheat were greater than of rice. Soil available N was decreased by elevated [CO2] by 47% in LN and 29% in NN at the rice tillering stage at jointing stage and decreased by 25.4% and 28.3% in LN and by 33.3% and 53.1% in NN at the wheat seeding and heading stages, respectively. Soil available P was decreased by elevated [CO2] in rice by 32.0% in LN and by 29.6% in NN at the jointing stage, but increased by 22.4% and 20.8% at the heading stage and by 33.8% and 30.7% at the ripening stage in LN and NN, respectively. While in the wheat season, soil available P was not affected significantly by elevated [CO2] at each stage.

We developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries representing 6.1 haploid equivalents of the tetraploid Leymus genome (10.7 Mb). Overgo probes designed from the lax-barrenstalk1 orthogene hybridized to 12 Leymus BAC clones. Deduced amino-acid sequences from seven BAC clones were highly conserved with the rice, maize, and sorghum lax-barrenstalk1orthogenes. Gene specific primers designed from two of the most divergent BAC clones map to homoeologous regions of Leymus LG3a and LG3b and align with the lax-barrenstalk1 orthogene on rice 1L. Comparisons of genomic DNA sequences revealed two other conserved regions surrounding the Leymus LG3a, rice, and sorghum lax-barrenstalk1 ortholoci, and one of these regions was also present in maize and Leymus LG3b sequences. Comparisons of Leymus LG3a and LG3b lax-barrenstalk1 coding sequences and flanking genomic regions elucidate molecular differences between subgenomes.","November 2009","2015-06-01 19:22:37","2015-06-01 19:22:37","","427-438","","5","177","","Plant Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Axillary branch meristem; Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library; Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain; Homoeologous loci; Orthologous loci; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Transcription factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods This report describes the investigation of a baker with asthma who reported a workplace response to rye flour and none to wheat flour, despite co-reactivity to both wheat and rye antigen. Results Skin prick tests, RASTs and basophil stimulation tests were positive for both wheat and rye antigen, but quantitatively greater for rye than wheat. Bronchial challenge elicited a much greater response to the rye-wheat flour mix used in the bakery than to 100% wheat flour. Conclusions The greater clinical response to rye than to wheat may be immunologically mediated, but could also be due to physical characteristics of rye flour such as greater dose of inhaled airborne particles or an irritative effect. This information may be useful for medical management and occupational hygiene control, and should stimulate further research into rye flour in Baker's asthma.","AUG  2005","2015-06-01 17:30:23","2015-06-01 17:30:23","","153-155","","2","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000230982700009","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global demand for cement is forecast to grow by 4.7% annually, which will increase CO2 emissions. One way to mitigate the CO2 generated during cement manufacturing is to use biocement. Biocement is a blend of bio-silica, produced from combustion of organic residues, with Portland cement. Biocement requires less energy intensive clinker, with its related carbon emission, to produce a good cementing agent. Small scale biocement production in tropical areas has shown that blending cement with bio-silica can have environmental, economic and technical benefits. It is also found that a number of crops grown in temperate regions of Canada with high silicon concentration and calorific content have the potential to make biocement. In addition, the combustion process can be integrated into energy production to simultaneously gain the energy and the bio-silica ash. The results indicated that switchgrass, barley, oat and sunflower produce silicon-rich residues and could be good candidates to consider for both energy and biocement production in Canada.","December 2011","2015-06-01 19:24:25","2015-06-01 19:24:25","","351-362","","4","110","","Biosystems Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe the expression, purification and characterization of a recombinant Lol p 1 overproduced in Escherichia coli. The recombinant allergen, expressed in high yields and purified in milligram amounts, bound to specific IgE antibodies from human sera, induced histamine release from sensitized humin basophils, and elicited rabbit antisera that recognize specifically recombinant Lol p 1 and natural Lol p 1 of pollen extract. Recombinant Lol p 1 was used to develop ImmunoCAP assays for analysis of 150 sera that were Radioallergosorbent test positive to L. perenne pollen. In 130 of them (87%) the assay detected a significant level of IgE antibodies to Lol p 1, reaching on average 37% of the level obtained with a test for IgE to the whole grass pollen extract. To map epitopes on Lol p 1, we produced three deletion mutants [des-(116-240)-Lol p 1, des-(1-88)-Lol p 1 and des-(133-189)-Lol p 1], which were efficiently expressed in bacteria. These all showed a strong reactivity with the specific rabbit IgG antibodies, but lacked most or all the allergenic properties of recombinant Lol p 1. A study of the antigenic structure of Lol p 1 was performed using the three deletion mutants and a set of 17-18-residue overlapping synthetic peptides covering the whole allergen sequence. The results indicate that human IgE and rabbit IgG antibodies bind to distinct regions of Lol p 1, and that at least some important IgE epitopes are mainly conformational. The findings suggest that recombinant allergens constitute useful reagents for further development of serological diagnosis of allergy and that it should be possible to produce immunogenic fragments of allergenic proteins without allergenic properties.","1997","2015-06-01 20:31:04","2015-06-01 22:37:26","","886-894","","3","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Allergen mutant; Lolium perenne; perennial rye grass; Recombinant allergen; Recombinant Lol p 1; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","Lolium perenne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greater insight into the mechanisms regulating biomass partitioning after defoliation enables ecologists and rangeland managers to interpret and predict population and community dynamics in Mediterranean grasslands more efficiently. Two typical Mediterranean grasses, Triticum dicoccoides, an annual species, and Hordeum bulbosum, a perennial species, were grown in containers in the open. They were subjected to a series of defoliation treatments that comprised three clipping frequencies and three clipping heights in a full factorial combination. In addition, individuals of both species were sampled in the field, in paddocks that were grazed, and in a control exclosure that was closed to grazing during the growing season. The experiment was conducted over two growing seasons, one unusually dry and one unusually wet. The clipping treatments invariably caused a reduction in the amount of biomass partitioned to the reproductive organs, but had little effect on the vegetative components of the plants. Greater tillering following defoliation compensated, to a large degree, for the loss of photosynthetic biomass following defoliation. The effect of grazing on biomass partitioning was much lower than the effect of clipping. Under grazing, the investment in reproductive biomass was considerably higher than when the grasses were clipped. The results of this experiment help to elucidate the reasons for the persistence of these species and, especially, for the dominance of Hordeum bulbosum in many eastern Mediterranean grasslands.","JAN  2002","2015-06-01 17:47:38","2015-06-01 17:47:38","","1","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000173848000022","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed replicated experiments and monitored farm-scale production to evaluate the effects of landscape position, vegetation type, and year on yields of monocultures and mixtures. Research was conducted on a 262-ha South Dakota working farm where cropland had been replanted with a variety of native grassland types having biofuel feedstock potential. Vegetation type (diverse mixture or switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L.] monoculture) and year interacted to influence yield in replicated experiments (p &lt; 0.10). Mean annual switchgrass yield above a stubble height of 10 cm was 9.3 Mg ha−1 in two replicated experiments, and was greater than yield of mixtures (7.3 Mg ha−1) in 6 of 7 year × vegetation type combinations. Landscape position interacted with year and vegetation type to influence yield (p &lt; 0.10). Variability was generally greatest at the lowest landscape position. On the farm's larger fields (0.4–46 ha), three-year mean yields of switchgrass monocultures cut at ground level (12.7 Mg ha−1) were also greater than yields of mixtures (9.7 Mg ha−1) but both were less than prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) monoculture yield (13.2 Mg ha−1) in a restored wetland.

Of the five fields sampled more than once, only two suffered significant increases in damage over time. One field showed significantly less damage over time. Within-field damage was highest along the field borders and where wetland habitats were in close proximity to a field. Damage control expenditures were relatively low for first crop rice. Only one of four ratoon crop fields yielded a sizable economic return. Two fields would have yielded sizable returns if losses to blackbirds had been less. One ratoon-cropped field would not have yielded a positive economic return even without blackbird damage.","1988","2015-06-01 18:33:52","2015-06-01 18:33:52","","i-iv, 1-8","","1662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI198886123142","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, there has been a proposal to protect the soil by means of eliminating tilling.

We examined the breeding ecology of the two species in San Jose, Mindoro, Philippines, for four rice cropping seasons (two dry and two wet) over two years, 2009–2010, as a basis to develop effective management. We found to our surprise that their breeding ecology was similar. For both species (i) the onset of the breeding season was at the tillering stage of the rice crop; (ii) conception of adult females was highest at booting and ripening of rice; (iii) the highest litter size occurred at the ripening and stubble stages, and the lowest at tillering. Based on their breeding ecology we recommend that the most effective strategy to reduce damage to rice crops is to prevent the development of high populations of both species of rice field rats. This goal requires coordinated community control at both the sowing/planting time and maximum tillering of rice, in combination with the synchronous planting of rice to limit the length of the main breeding season.","October 15, 2012","2015-06-01 19:38:32","2015-06-01 19:38:32","","39-45","","0","161","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Breeding ecology; Ecologically based rodent management; Lowland irrigated rice; R. argentiventer; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rodents; R. tanezumi; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oryza longistaminata is an undomesticated, perennial, rhizomatous relative of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Using five sets of 4 × 2 factorial mating designs, we crossed rhizomatous interspecific genotypes (IGs) from an intermated O. sativa/O. longistaminata population with male-fertile IG selections from the intermated population, and with O. sativa CVs. Parents and progeny were planted in an upland field at IRRI using a randomized complete block design and evaluated for rhizome expression, survival after 1 year, vigor of the survivors, and yield. For the IG parents, rhizome expression was variable and penetrance of most genotypes was incomplete, but genotypes that demonstrated the potential for moderate rhizome expression had high penetrance (89% average). The CV parents yielded 11.0 g/plant on average but none produced rhizomes or survived 1 year. The IG parents averaged yields of 3.1 g/plant, 57% rhizomatous and 36% survival. The IG/IG progeny averaged yields of 4.2 g/plant, 32% rhizomatous and 37% survival. The IG/CV progeny averaged yields of 6.0 g/plant, 18% rhizomatous and 16% survival. Nine IG/IG progeny and six IG/CV progeny were rhizomatous, perennial, and yielded at least 5 g/plant, and five of these yielded more than 10 g/plant. For the IG parents and IG/IG progeny, rhizome presence and expression were positively associated with survival and vigor of the survivors. General combining ability effects were significant for percent survival and yield but not percent rhizomatous. Specific combining ability effects were significant for percent rhizomatous, percent survival and yield. By selecting female parents for long rhizomes and male parents for fertility, considerable gains in rhizome expression, survival and yield were made. The development of perennial upland rice CVs should be feasible via introgression of genes from O. longistaminata.","2006","2015-06-01 20:26:20","2015-06-01 22:23:08","","39-48","","1","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Clonal performance; Fertility; Interspecific crosses; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rhizome; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SUK35K44","journalArticle","1934","PRUTSKOVA, M. G.","Breeding grain crops.","Bull. Appl. Bot. Leningrad, Ser. A","","","","","The most notable achievement of the Soviet grain breeders is the distribution of 59 improved varieties of the main grain crops, winter and spring wheat, barley, oats and rye, suitable for cultivation in all the main regions of the Soviet Union. These 59 represent the best varieties chosen in variety tests involving 500-600 varieties, and some of them have been the means of extending the cultivation of the crop in question into new areas, for instance wheat growing has been pushed farther north by the production of the ultra-early spring wheat Novinka, also possessed of excellent grain qualities, and of various new hardy winter wheats, including rye-wheat hybrid 46/131. The same is true in the case of barley and oats. One of the new early oats is also highly resistant to drought and to rust. Cultivation in the arid zones has been made possible by the creation of new drought-resistant varieties of wheat and barley at the same time distinguished by improved quality and greater earliness. Still further improvement in these varieties is desired nevertheless in respect of yield, and in some cases also quality or cold-resistance, and in nearly every case in respect of disease resistance. Various hybrids and selections distinguished by improved disease resistance are quoted, special interest being attached to hybrids of Avena sativa x A. byzantina, which in 1933 exceeded the standard in yield by four times and are much more resistant to leaf rust; certain American and Canadian wheat hybrids are also very promising. For purposes of mechanized harvesting, great importance is directed to non-shedding and non-lodging strains and mention is made of a number of varieties favourable in this respect, and of others that a, re promising in all respects but this. For instance, a new rye produced at Detskoje Selo by crossing the local rye with Rumker is free from both lodging and shedding whilst exceeding the standard variety Vyatka considerably in yield. A table is given in which the origin of all the most promising new varieties is shewn, i.e. the material from which they were produced and the methods used, whether selection or hybridization, etc. From this it is clear that the local varieties have contributed most to the formation of the new improved material, since they are the ones preeminently possessed of the desired characters, such as drought and cold resistance, earliness, yield, etc. Many of these local varieties were introduced years ago from abroad and often represented partly impure populations of some successful cultivated variety, since which time they have been subjected to a process of natural selection for tolerance of the unfavourable conditions of the particular region in which they are grown. An emphatic plea is made for the preservation and further study of these local varieties and for an extension of the work of hybridizing them with varieties from other countries, specially those countries known to be characterized by varieties possessed of certain special characters, such as earliness in the wheats of the near East, etc. etc. The practical possibilities of distant hybridization are also emphasized and reference is made to the production of hybrids possessed of a non-shedding habit, drought-resistance, good milling and baking quality and satisfactory yield from crosses of hard and soft wheats at Saratov, valuable rust-resistant oats from Avena sativa x A. byzantina and disease resistant wheats from crosses of T. durum with T. dicoccum; and finally to the new genus Secalotriticum produced from crosses of wheat and rye, together with a number of other useful hybrids from the same cross, one of which is already being grown on quite a large scale. In 1930 successful crosses were made of spring wheat with Agropyrum intermedium and more recently with A. elongatum, from which it is hoped to obtain perennial wheats and so present an entirely new solution to the problems of drought and cold resistance. A plea is also made for an attempt to accelerate the speed of breeding work by application of vernalization and other measures and to reduce the period required to produce a new variety, if possible, to 5 years.","1934","2015-06-01 17:57:38","2015-06-01 17:57:38","","93-103","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600067","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The persistent problem of worldwide soil erosion has rekindled interest in perennial grain crops. All of our current grain crops are annuals; therefore, developing an array of new perennial grains - grasses, legumes, and others - will require a long-term commitment. Fortunately, many perennial species can be hybridized with related annual crops, allowing us to incorporate genes of domestication much more quickly than did our ancestors who first selected the genes. Some grain crops - including rye, rice, and sorghum - can be hybridized with close perennial relatives to establish new gene pools. Others, such as wheat, oat, maize, soybean, and sunflower, must be hybridized with more distantly related perennial species and genera. Finally, some perennial species with relatively high grain yields - intermediate wheatgrass, wildrye, lymegrass, eastern gamagrass, Indian ricegrass, Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, and probably others - are candidates for direct domestication without interspecific hybridization. To ensure diversity in the field and foster further genetic improvement, breeders will need to develop deep gene pools for each crop. Discussions of breeding strategies for perennial grains have concentrated on allocation of photosynthetic resources between seeds and vegetative structures. However, perennials will likely be grown in more diverse agro-ecosystems and require arrays of traits very different from those usually addressed by breeders of annuals. The only way to address concerns about the feasibility of perennial grains is to carry out breeding programs with adequate resources on a sufficient time scale. A massive program for breeding perennial grains could be funded by diversion of a relatively small fraction of the world's agricultural research budget.","2002","2015-06-01 17:19:06","2015-06-01 17:19:06","","59-91","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000174854200001","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.","Breeding perennial varieties of wheat and other plants.","Selektsiya i semenovodstvo","","","","","Since 1930 work on the production of perennial forms of barley, wheat and rye has been in progress. The three methods used for wheat are hybridization of wheat with perennial rye and with Agropyrum and the selection of perennial wheats from wild and cultivated forms. The most promising of the wheat-rye crosses have been Leucurum 1364/1 x S. montanum and Stepnjacka x S. montanum and from the first-named combination a fertile perennial hard wheat was obtained comprising lines with 49-39 grains to the ear and a thousand corn weight of from 43.7 to 44.2 grm. These yields were obtained from vernalized seed without irrigation or manuring. Normally developed hybrids of increased yielding capacity proved resistant to brown rust and drought. Their winter-hardiness has still to be fully tested. Their main defect is brittleness of the ear but it is hoped that in the course of segregation forms without brittle ears may be obtained as has already been done by hybridization with non-shattering forms. Crosses are also contemplated between wheat and perennial rye with a rough rachis experimentally obtained by crosses of cultivated and wild perennial rye. So far only a few F 1 combinations from wheat crossed by Agropyrum are available but an F 2consisting of 100 plants has been raised from Agropyrum elongatum x Melanopus 0122. Comparing the perennial wheat x rye and wheat x Agropyrum hybrids the latter are seen to have a great advantage in their resistance to fungus diseases. On the other hand their yield is very low. The likelihood of the existence of undiscovered wild perennial wheats, particularly among the wild wheats of Armenia, is mentioned. Among the advantages cited which the perennial forms of various crops such as cereals, flax and sunflower have over the annual forms is high yielding capacity in successive years which ensures a second crop of hay and in the case of some spring forms, even a second crop of grain. The different developmental stages shewn by various groups of plants and their relation to tillering capacity are discussed. Suggestions for meeting various difficulties that arise in the cultivation of perennial forms and a statement of future aims in the production of perennial wheat conclude the paper.","1936","2015-06-01 17:39:41","2015-06-01 22:38:24","","20-24","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19371600946","","","","search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is thought to be due to the habits of the plants which in the first year utilize a considerable amount of plastic material for building up the roots; in subsequent years the perennials live mainly on the roots previously formed and use the nutrients deposited in the autumn. Perennials are more resistant and adaptable to environment, and therefore the vegetation of deserts, highlands and extreme northerly regions is mainly represented by perennials. Almost all known plants have their own perennial forms, but a number of defects prevent their direct use in practice. These defects could be eliminated, however, in hybridization with the annual cultivated forms or with some other species, as in the case of wheat. Crossing Vicia cracca with cultivated annual forms eliminates the defects of perennial vetch. Among perennial Lathyrus latifolius valuable forms have been selected.

The aim of this study was to develop an assessment method for crop-climate suitability that was generic enough to be applied to a wide range of issues and crops. The method proposed is based on agroclimatic indicators that are calculated over phenological periods (ecoclimatic indicators). These indicators are highly relevant since they provide accurate information about the effect of climate on particular plant processes and cultural practices that take place during specific phenological periods. Three case studies were performed in order to illustrate the potentialities of the method. They concern annual (maize and wheat) and perennial (grape) crops and focus on the study of climate suitability in terms of the following criteria: ecophysiological, days available to carry out cultural practices, and harvest quality. The analysis of the results revealed both the advantages and limitations of the method. The method is general and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of issues even if an expert assessment is initially needed to build the analysis framework. The limited number of input data makes it possible to use it to explore future possibilities for agriculture in many areas. The access to intermediate information through elementary ecoclimatic indicators allows users to propose targeted adaptations when climate suitability is not satisfactory.","2015","2015-06-01 20:42:27","2015-06-01 22:39:57","","94-106","","0","207","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Climate suitability; Crop ecophysiology; Crop management; Crop phenology; Ecoclimatic indicator; Indicator-based method of evaluation; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Yield quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tzvelev) had a high BNI capacity and releases about 20 times more BNI compounds (about 30 ATU g-1 root dry weight 24 h-1) than Triticum aestivum L. (cultivated wheat). The root exudate from cultivated wheat has no inhibitory effect on nitrification when applied to soil; however, the root exudate from L. racemous suppressed NO 3 - formation and kept more than 90% of the soil's inorganic-N in the NH4 +-form for 60 days. The high-BNI capacity of L. racemosus is mostly associated with chromosome Lr#n. Two other chromosomes Lr#J, and Lr#I also have an influence on BNI production. Tolerance of L. racemosus to NH4 + is controlled by chromosome 7Lr#1-1. Sustained release of BNI compounds occurred only in the presence of NH4 + in the root environment. Given the level of BNI production expressed in DALr#n and assuming normal plant growth, we estimated that nearly 87,500,000 ATU of BNI activity ha-1 day-1 could be released in a field of vigorously growing wheat; this amounts to the equivalent of the inhibitory effect from the application of 52.5 g of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (one AT unit of BNI activity is equivalent to 0.6 μg of nitrapyrin). At this rate of BNI production it would take only 19 days for a BNI-enabled wheat crop to produce the inhibitory power of a standard commercial application of nitrapyrin, 1 kg ha-1. The synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, blocked specifically the AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) pathway, while the BNI from L. racemosus blocked the HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase) pathway in Nitrosomonas. Here we report the first finding of high production of BNI in a wild relative of any cereal and its successful introduction and expression in cultivated wheat. These results demonstrate the potential for empowering the new generation of wheat cultivars with high-BNI capacity to control nitrification in wheat-production systems.","2007","2015-06-01 20:43:13","2015-06-02 02:05:38","","55-64","","1-2","299","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Biological nitrification inhibition (BNI); Leymus racemosus; nitrification; Nitrogen use efficiency; Nitrosomonas europaea; Root exudate; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Triticum aestivum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Susceptibility to freezing damage limits its further use in temperate zones. The objective of this study was to identify candidate genes significantly associated with winter survival and spring regrowth in a global collection of 192 perennial ryegrass accessions. Significant differences in winter survival (WS), percentage of canopy green cover (CGC), chlorophyll index (Chl), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found among accessions. After controlling population structure, LpLEA3 encoding a late embryogenesis abundant group 3 protein and LpCAT encoding a catalase were associated with CGC and Chl, while LpMnSOD encoding a magnesium superoxide dismutase and LpChl Cu-ZnSOD encoding a chlorophyll copper–zinc superoxide dismutase were associated with NDVI or Chl. Significant association was also discovered between C-repeat binding factor LpCBF1b and WS. Three sequence variations identified in LpCAT, LpMnSOD, and LpChl Cu-ZnSOD were synonymous substitutions, whereas one pair of adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LpLEA3 and one SNP in LpCBF1b resulted in amino acid change.

Evidence suggests that the majority of green ash woodlands are in degraded condition with declining tree canopies and ground layers dominated by exotic grasses. The dense sod formed by these perennial grasses was hypothesized to interfere with green ash regeneration from seed. The purpose of this study was to test potential methods of restoring green ash regeneration in these declining woodlands. The effects of preseeding grazing and herbicide treatment and postgermination fertilizer on the recruitment, survival, and growth of green ash seedlings at each of four study sites typical of declining green ash woodlands in southeastern Montana were assessed. Six green ash trees at each of three sites were cut to examine the relationship of age, size, and health to sprouting ability and growth. Herbicide application had a positive effect on green ash recruitment and survival of green ash seedlings in woodlands with a dense sod of exotic grasses; seedling survival after 3–4 yr was ca. 10 times greater in herbicide-treated plots compared to controls or grazed plots. Seedlings grew slowly although fertilizer had a small positive effect on growth at one site. All coppiced trees produced basal sprouts, but sprout growth was severely curtailed at two of the three sites by deer browsing, suggesting that coppicing could increase tree canopy cover by replacing weakened trees with new and more vigorous boles and branches, but only where browsing by cattle and deer is reduced. Maintaining eastern Montana green ash woodlands in good condition should be given priority because restoration will be difficult.","November 2009","2015-06-01 19:23:29","2015-06-01 19:23:29","","564-571","","6","62","","Rangeland Ecology & Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","coppicing; exotic grasses; herbicide; livestock grazing; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); range margin; restoration; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of differences in growth and in seed-output previously found within this genus, we hypothesized that C acquisition strategies would not be fully coupled with predictions derived from a species life-cycle. Further, we expected to find different suites of traits related to C-acquisition among perennial species of Physaria. We found species with high (P. gracilis and P. pinetorum) and low (P. mendocina and P. angustifolia) relative growth rate (RGR) and biomass. The variation in RGR was linked to differences in specific leaf area (SLA) and allocation to leaves (leaf mass ratio, LMR) and roots (root mass ratio, RMR), but not to the species life-cycle. Physaria gracilis had high allocation to leaf area (leaf area ratio, LAR), LMR, high SLA, and low RMR and carbohydrates reserves. The slow-growth strategy found in P. mendocina was linked to low LAR, low SLA and large below-ground allocation. The other species showed intermediate strategies between these two. The sets of traits present in P. gracilis and in P. mendocina are extremes in the C acquisition-conservation trade-off, and may allow them to cope with low resource environments in different ways. SLA, LMR and RMR were the main determinants of RGR, while total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) and leaf longevity were linked to the life-cycle. Taken together these characters define the intermediate growth strategies of P. angustifolia and P. pinetorum. These intermediate strategies were not dependent on the species life cycle and support the hypothesis of uncoupled relationships between growth, C acquisition strategies and life-cycle.","2015","2015-06-01 17:17:24","2015-06-02 02:05:00","","1-9","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000353601700001","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

V. Michurin and L. Burbank and the new methods and means of influencing interbreeding pairs, this problem is, in principle, resolved. The research of the author and his co-workers on the interbreeding of cultivated and wild grains, methods employed by them for overcoming non-interbreeding, obtaining fertile hybrids and cultivating underdeveloped hybrid embryos (in highly nutrient media) are reported here. Thus the interbreeding of wheat with species of Agropyron produced not only new varieties but also new species of wheat: perennial wheat, Triticum agropyrotriticum perenne (Cic), and grain-fodder wheat T. agropyrotriticum submitans (Cic). The interbreeding then of Agropyron with the forms of rye having a high gluten content makes it possible to obtain a valuable grain competing in its flour-grinding and bread-baking qualities with wheat. Hybrids obtained from crossing the cultivated grains T. vulgare, T. durum, Hordeum, Secale with some species of Elymus (E. arenarius, E. giganteus) possess a number of valuable qualities: the potential for powerful development, no exacting demands in regard to soil or climatic conditions, and a high yield, 700-800 grains on one spike.","1959","2015-06-01 17:53:12","2015-06-01 17:53:12","","832-838","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19613600046090","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although non-pretreated biomass samples exhibited a large variation in enzymatic digestibility, the COSLIF-pretreated biomass samples exhibited similar high enzymatic glucan digestibilities and fast hydrolysis rates. Glucan digestibilities of most pretreated feedstocks were ∼93% at five filter paper units per gram of glucan.

Soil mineral N was measured annually in autumn and spring during the period of set-aside cover, with more frequent SMN sampling over the first winter after ploughing out the covers. Spring SMN was measured in the second year after set-aside. Nitrate leaching losses were also measured at three sites in the first winter after destruction of the 5-year set-aside covers. Winter cereals were grown in both test years after each set-aside period. Amounts of both autumn and spring SMN in the perennial rye-grass (PRG), perennial rye-grass/white clover (PRG/WC) and natural regeneration (NR) covers were generally less than, or similar to those in the continuous arable treatment during each year of set-aside, indicating a slightly smaller nitrate leaching risk under set-aside management. Slight increases in autumn SMN, and hence leaching potential were, however, observed under PRG/WC in the fourth and fifth years, compared with continuous arable cropping. Ploughing out of both 3-year and 5-year covers increased soil N supply and potential nitrate leaching losses over winter, compared with continuous arable cropping. By the following spring, mean increases across all sites in amounts of SMN after 3-year covers of PRG, NR and PRG/WC were 14, 18 and 33 kg ha -1 N, respectively, compared with the arable rotation. Equivalent increases in spring SMN following destruction of the 5-year set-aside covers were almost identical, at 17, 19 and 33 kg ha -1, respectively, although only the ploughed-out PRG/WC covers increased SMN at the clay sites. Measured nitrate leaching losses in the first winter after 5-year set-aside were greatest after PRG/WC at two sites on shallow chalk but greatest after NR, which had a naturally large clover content, at the third site which was on a sandy soil. However, the leaching losses after set-aside were relatively small, relative to typical losses after ploughing out intensively managed grass or grass/clover swards, and would have been compensated for by potentially less leaching during set-aside. Spring SMN measurements in the second year after ploughing out the set-aside covers, showed negligible or, for PRG/WC, only slight increases (12 - 18 kg ha -1) in residual soil N supply after both 3-year and 5-year covers, compared to continuous arable cropping. The extra N mineralisation after cover destruction justified small reductions in fertiliser N inputs for the first, but not second crop following either 3- or 5-year set-aside, unless the cover had contained a large clover content. Both 3-year and 5-year set-aside covers had minimal or no effect on either organic matter content, apart from a slight increase in the PRG/WC treatments, or extractable phosphorus, potassium and magnesium status in the topsoil.","2001","2015-06-01 20:30:20","2015-06-01 20:30:20","","157-177","","2","228","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Nitrate leaching; Non-rotational set-aside; Plant covers; Scopus; search.rye; Soil mineral nitrogen; SPV; Three and five-year set-aside; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Topsoil nutrient status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst these conditions are favourable for the rice crop, they are less so for any dryland crop, such as mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzek) or soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), grown in the dry season (DS) after rice harvest leading to low or erratic yields. The physical properties of soils puddled for rice were measured as they changed in the period after draining flood water for rice harvest. The experiments were run at four sites in Indonesia and the Philippines for 4–6 weeks, during which they were kept free from weeds. Apart from one site, where there were heavy rain showers, the sites received no effective rainfall during the experiment. Soil moisture content and hydraulic potential in the upper 40 cm were measured regularly in five replicate plots. Evaporation from the soil was measured using mini-lysimeters. Strength properties were measured using a penetrometer. Cracks were measured using an intercept technique. Hydraulic conductivity was calculated using a modification of the instantaneous profile technique. The sites behaved in a similar fashion, with initial loss of water by drainage, followed by loss by evaporation from the surface. However, the low conductivities limited the upwards supply of water for evaporation so that evaporation from the soil surface decreased. This resulted in strong drying of the upper 5–10 cm, but much smaller decreases in moisture content lower down. The strength of the upper layers increased as they dried. The low conductivities suggest that waterlogging due to heavy rain is likely to cause problems for dry season cropping. However, the preservation of water in the sub-soil may allow flexibility in the sowing dates for dry season crops to avoid periods of heavy rain or shortage of labour.","July 2000","2015-06-01 19:38:00","2015-06-01 19:38:00","","83-104","","1–2","56","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dry season cropping; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Shrink/swell soils; Soil puddling; Soil strength; SPV; Water movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four markers, i.e., RM246, RM241, RM303 and RM164 completely favoring the IR68835 allele (shifting of allele frequencies from KDML105 to IR68835) were identified on chromosomes 1, 4 and 5, respectively. Therefore, these markers could be linked to the resistance genes functioning against the MXL, THL48 and THL149. Furthermore, significant shifting of alleles was identified at six markers located on chromosomes 2, 4, 8, 9 and 12. Seven DNA markers linked to specific resistance genes were identified, in which allele from IR68835 at 6 markers, i.e., RM6, RM205, RM211, RM252, RM273 and RM342 reduced disease score (DS), against blast isolates THL16, THL329, THL458, THL831, THL868 and THL96036 while allele from KDML105 at RM208 (Pi-kd on chromosomes 2) reduce DS against THL84, THL191, THL557 and THL1108. In this study, the use of DNA markers enabled the identification of specific resistance genes in the backcross breeding materials developed from routine rice breeding program through the conventional phenotypic selection. In this experiment, the usefulness of breeding materials from conventional breeding program in identifying genes corresponding to the selection was illustrated. Linked markers and their genomic location provide necessary information for further use of marker-assisted selection to improve blast resistance in rice breeding program.","April 28, 2011","2015-06-01 19:38:44","2015-06-01 19:38:44","","32-39","","1","122","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conventional backcross breeding; QTL; Race specific resistance; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While nearly three-quarters of the genes are expressed at a constant level in all six lineages, a large portion of the genome, ranging from 1767 to 4489 genes, exhibited differential expression between Asian domesticated and wild rice with repression or down-regulation of genome expression in Asian cultivated rice as the dominant trend. Importantly, we found this repression was achieved to a large extent by the differential expression of a single member of paralogous gene families. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that genes related to catabolism are repressed while genes related to anabolism up-regulated.

N.","Chromosome-mediated and direct gene transfers in wheat","Genome","","0831-2796","10.1139/gen-42-4-570","","Wild grasses, including relatives of wheat, have several desirable characters that can be introduced into both bread wheat and durum wheat. Since current wheat cultivars lack certain traits, for example, resistance to fusarium head blight (scab), related wild grasses may be the only option for useful variability. Wide hybridization of wheat with grasses, coupled with cytogenetic manipulation of the hybrid material, has been instrumental in the genetic improvement of wheat. Chromosome engineering methodologies, based on the manipulation of pairing control mechanisms and induced translocations, have been employed to transfer into wheat specific disease and pest resistance genes from annual (e.g., rye) or perennial (e.g., Thinopyrum spp., Lophopyrum spp., and Agropyron spp.) members of the wheat tribe, Triticeae. The advent of in situ hybridization techniques, for example, fluorescent GISH combined with Giemsa C-banding, has proved immensely useful in characterizing alien chromatin specifying resistance to various pathogens and pests. The use of DNA markers (RAPDs and RFLPs) helps to identify desirable genotypes more precisely and, thereby, facilitates gene transfer into wheat. Such markers may be particularly helpful in monitoring the introgression of alien genes in the wheat genome. In fact, several cultivars, particularly of bread wheat, contain superior traits of alien origin. The development of novel gene-transfer techniques in the past decade that allow direct delivery of DNA into regenerable embryogenic callus of wheat has opened up new avenues of alien-gene transfer into wheat cultivars. Thus, transgenic bread and durum wheats have been produced and methods of gene delivery standardized. The application of transgenic technology has not only yielded herbicide-resistant wheats, but has also helped to improve grain quality by modifying the protein and starch profiles of the grain. These in vitro approaches to gene transfer are developing rapidly, and promise to become an integral part of plant breeding efforts. However, the new biotechnological tools will complement, not replace, conventional plant breeding.","AUG  1999","2015-06-01 17:31:25","2015-06-01 22:44:07","","570-583","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000082079800005","","","","AGRICOLA; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass""); WOS","chromosomes; cultivars; cytogenetics; disease resistance; genetic engineering; genetic improvement; genetic markers; genetic resistance; gene transfer; genotype; interspecific hybridization; introgression; literature reviews; monitoring; nucleic acid hybridization; pest resistance; plant breeding; plant genetic resources; random amplified polymorphic DNA technique; restriction fragment length polymorphism; transgenic plants; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; wide hybridization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weedy rice management has remained challenging to farmers, mainly due to the weed's physiological and morphological resemblance to rice cultivars. The introduction of Clearfield® rice provides an alternative solution and an additional tool for integrated weed management. Clearfield® rice-based programs result in the cleanest rice fields in the southern U.S. However, persistent application of the imidazolinone herbicides (imazethapyr, imazamox, and imazapic) in Clearfield® rice raises concerns about the possible evolution of resistance to ALS-inhibitor herbicides in weedy rice and the transfer of resistance trait. The risk of resistant weedy rice evolution is much higher in Asia, Latin America, and other tropical regions where there is no winterkill and rice is planted at least twice each year. Herbicide carryover to rotational crops is also a concern. We summarized the progress of commercialization of Clearfield® rice in 15 countries across the continents of America, Asia and Europe. In some countries, imidazolinone-resistant weedy rice outcrosses have been found abundant, thereby negating the utility of Clearfield® technology. The persistence of imidazolinone herbicide residues in the soil is a concern in regions where multiple crops are planted in a year, or the following year. These challenges should be anticipated by countries that are considering adopting Clearfield® rice technology. Issues associated with gene escape, resistance evolution in weedy rice, and herbicide carryover to rotational crops remain to be resolved. Research to achieve sustainable solutions for weedy rice management, must be continued and intense educational programs for growers must be sustained.","July 2013","2015-06-01 19:37:24","2015-06-01 19:37:24","","40-51","","0","49","","Crop Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clearfield® rice; Gene flow; Herbicide soil persistence; Imidazolinone-resistant rice; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Weedy rice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have recently studied IgE response to tobacco in asthmatic patients sensitised to Lolium perenne (Perennial rye grass pollen) and have found that 30% of the tobacco responsive patients also have latex sensitisation. Objective The aim of our study was to investigate the possibility of cross-reactivity between tobacco and latex in asthmatic patients with IgE response to latex. Methods A study was performed on tobacco and latex exposure in 15 patients who suffered from asthma and latex sensitisation and who were randomly chosen from our database of latex-sensitive patients. To identify tobacco and latex as possible allergens that might cause clinical specific responses, all these patients were tested with prick-tests, specific IgE to tobacco, latex and related allergens, bronchial challenge, and patch tests with tobacco, latex and nicotine. Immunological response was evaluated with immunoblotting, immunoblotting-inhibition and EAST-inhibition tests. Results Positive prick and bronchial challenge with specific IgE&gt;0.35 kU/L to tobacco was demonstrated in 11 asthmatics who were also sensitised to rye grass. Tobacco IgE level was related with sensitisation to latex (p&lt;0.002), but not to other vegetables belonging to the Solanaceae family. EAST-inhibition and immunoblotting-inhibition showed the existence of cross-reactivity between tobacco and latex. Conclusions Cross-reactivity exists between latex and tobacco allergens.

If perennial cultivars of upland rice were developed, they would provide farmers with an inexpensive tool to produce a preferred food while conserving soil. O. rufipogon, the undomesticated progenitor of O. sativa, includes perennial and stoloniferous forms. To evaluate the feasibility of developing perennial cultivars by combining genes of O. sativa and O. rufipogon, four trials were conducted in an upland field at IRRI: O. sativa/O. rufipogon F1 clone and cutting height trial, F2 family trial, and two O. sativa/stoloniferous-selection factorial mating design trials. Plants were established at the beginning of the rainy season, then subjected to a 6-month dry season and evaluated for survival after 1 year. Of the 2101 cultivar control plants, only three IR47686-1-4-B individuals survived and none produced stolons. The 18 F1 clones, which were selected from previous trials with less drought stress, ranged in survival from 4.4 to 91.4%. Cutting height at harvest did not affect survival. Survival among the F2 families ranged from 9.4 to 31.9%. Segregation for stolon presence did not differ from a 3:1 ratio for five of the six F2 families, suggesting the effect of a single dominant gene. Average yields per plant for the F2 families were 1/3 to 1/9 of yields for the cultivars. However, by crossing the F1s to cultivars, yield potential was almost fully recovered. For the full-sib families of the factorial trials, survival ranged from 0.0 to 48.6%. Azucena and IR47686-1-4-B, both japonica cultivars, exhibited greater general combining ability for survival relative to the six other cultivar parents. Thus, the process of developing perennial cultivars of rice should include screening annual cultivars to identify those with the best combining ability for survival. To develop cultivars of perennial upland rice, drought avoidance and/or tolerance from annual upland cultivars must be combined with the capacity for perennial growth from wild perennial species. The frequency of stolonifereous testcross progeny was lower than expected and was affected by the O. sativa parent. Thus, additional genes likely affected stolon penetrance and expression. Analyses of covariance indicated that stolons improved the likelihood of survival for progenies of the factorial trials but the effect was small (b &lt; 0.1), and that yield (g/plant) had a small negative effect on percent survival (b = −0.13 to −0.32). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introgress genes for perennial growth from wild O. rufipogon accessions into domesticated O. sativa. Additionally, strategies for developing perennial cultivars of upland rice were improved.","February 1, 2007","2015-06-01 19:20:43","2015-06-01 22:21:17","","155-167","","2–3","100","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fertility; Interspecific crosses; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Stolon; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complex fructans having both β-(2,1)- and β-(2,6)-linked fructosyl units accumulate in Triticeae plants commonly. Three enzymes (sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase, 1-SST, EC: 2.4.1.99; sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyltransferase, 6-SFT, EC: 2.4.1.10; and fructan: fructan 1-fructosyltransferase, 1-FFT, EC: 2.4.1.100) were involved in fructan biosynthesis in Triticeae plant species. We successfully isolated these genes from tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum, genotype: AABB), common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genotype: AABBDD) and three wild relatives of common wheat, Triticum urartu Thum. (the origin of the AA genome), Aegilops speltoides (Tausch) Gren. (the putative source of the SS genome) and Aegilops tauschii Coss. (the source of the DD genome). Sequence analysis revealed that all the FBEs (fructan biosynthetic enzymes) had three highly conserved functional motifs except 1-SST (EU981912) from tetraploid wheat species only with conserved DPNG. Low pI (isoelectric point) and potential N-glycosylation sites were predicted, which were crucial for protein compartmentation and post-translational process. Analysis on subcelluar localization signals showed that only 6-SFT had vacuolar-directed signal. Sequences alignment result showed that 1-SST and 1-FFT were more conservative and had closer relationship each other, while 6-SFT was more active during the evolution processing. According to the syntenic relationship between wheat and rice genome, FBEs were predicated to be located on the homeologous group 6 and group 2 chromosomes. Expression profile confirmed that expression of all the three FBEs were drought-stress induced. This study can assist to establish a useful theoretical platform for cold- or drought-tolerant improvement of wheat by modulating FBEs expression.","March 2010","2015-06-01 19:23:25","2015-06-01 19:23:25","","313-324","","3","9","","Agricultural Sciences in China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fructan biosynthesis enzymes; fructans; gene structure; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; search.wheat; SPV; wheat evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alfalfa is a legume with high nutritional value that establishes a symbiosis relation with Ensifer meliloti. Under saline conditions the alfalfa yield decreases and this symbiosis is affected. The aim of this work is to study the effect of the co-inoculation of alfalfa plants with Halomonas maura (a moderately halophile bacterium) and E. meliloti in saline soils to improve their productivity and growth under greenhouse and field conditions. Alfalfa plants were grown in Leonard jar under greenhouse conditions, using a N-free mineral solution to mimic the conditions of an Orthic Solonchak. Then alfalfa plants were grown in the field in the same soil type. Seeds were inoculated with E. meliloti, H. maura, co-inoculated with E. meliloti and H. Maura, or non-inoculated as a control in both experiments. In greenhouse experiments the co-inoculation of alfalfa plants increased significantly the shoot dry weight (0.64 ± 0.02 vs. 0.79 ± 0.02), the leghaemoglobin content (10.17 ± 0.03 vs. 11.25 ± 0.06) and water potential (−3.12 ± 0.02 vs. −2.79 ± 0.02) compared with the single inoculation with E. meliloti. In the field experiments, biomass of co-inoculated plants clearly outyielded those of plants inoculated with any inoculant. The co-inoculation of H. maura and E. meliloti enhances alfalfa productivity in saline soils, thus contributing to the agricultural exploitation of low productive areas. H. maura and E. meliloti could be considered in formulation of bioinoculants to contribute in the reduction of the overuse of chemical fertilizers and their environmental impacts.","March 2015","2015-06-01 19:22:47","2015-06-01 19:22:47","","81-86","","0","87","","Applied Soil Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bioinoculant; Mauran; Medicago sativa; Orthic Solonchak; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rhizobia; Saline stress; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the tendency for grain yield fluctuations caused by water stress, however, claypan soils may have potential for conversion from grain to grass production in support of biomass energy markets and conservation programs. This study examined the economic potential of transitioning from grain to perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production on claypan soils using comparative breakeven analysis. Partial budgets for a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and a perennial switchgrass cropping system were developed. Yield data from research plots with varying topsoil depths defined by the underlying claypan layer were used to establish yield expectations as affected by topsoil depth. Switchgrass yield projections for the claypan region were simulated with the Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model. Comparative breakeven prices for two switchgrass cultivars ranged from US$65 on marginal, eroded soils to US$124 Mg-1 on soils with >27 cm of topsoil. Breakeven yields with a biomass price of US$40 Mg-1 would require yield increases of up to 450% for lower yielding cultivars. The switchgrass cultivar Kanlow holds the most promise for biomass production on claypan soils; with an average projected yield of 12.56 Mg ha(-1), breakeven prices fall to around US$60-80 Mg-1 for marginal soils with <15 cm of topsoil. Based on these projections, perennial switchgrass shows potential to compete with conventional grain crops at reasonable yield levels on eroded soils in the Central Claypan region.","MAY-JUN  2012","2015-06-01 17:18:02","2015-06-01 22:44:50","","639-648","","3","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000304233600010","","","","Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on farming systems research comparing organic and conventional agroecosystems. The types of farming systems comparison studies, some of the metrics used, and integrative research approaches to farming systems studies are discussed. To hasten implementation of more sustainable agricultural systems, more farming systems comparison research, especially interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary, is needed, which brings together multiple disciplines and, when possible, non-academic participants to measure key sustainability indicators and/or ecosystem services. Such research does not just need to compare organic and conventional systems. In addition to organic farming systems, other innovative systems make up a modest, but growing, component of US and global agriculture and include alternative livestock production (e.g., grass-fed), mixed crop/livestock systems, conservation agriculture, integrated farming, agroforestry, and perennial grains. Such systems integrate production, environmental, and socioeconomic objectives and reflect greater awareness of ecosystem services. These systems can be studied in farming systems research, in which they are compared with each other or with conventional systems.","2013","2015-06-01 17:17:56","2015-06-01 17:17:56","","CM-2013-0429-01-RS","","April","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20133215263","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these two species, the former is believed to derive from a perennial wild rice (O. perennis) and the latter has an annual wild rice (O. breviligulata) as an ancestor. In order to know how closely the growth characteristics, perenniality or annuality, of each ancestor has been inherited to the present cultivar, we investigated inter-specific difference in ratooning ability after culm cutting treatments at the post heading stage. The growth vigor of ratoons was used as an indicator for the strength of vegetative growth continuity or growth perenniality here. Two cultivar lines, S173 (O. sativa) and G174 (O. glaberrima), were used as experimental materials. Seeds of these two lines were collected in the closely neighboring areas by the Niger River in West Africa, and their growth was tested at the experimental field of Kyushu University, Japan. The results obtained are as follows; 1) These two cultivars represented a vigorous growth to reach the harvest stage. The dry matter weight in leaves and culms decreased by export of the photosynthate from these parts to panicles in S173, whereas such a phenomenon was not detected in G174; the panicle weight increased with increase in weight of the non yield part of a plant. 2) The ratoon emergence ratios (No. of ratoons/No. of mother plant culms) at the early to late stages after heading were higher in S173 than in G174. 3) In the stock (the plant part below 10 cm height from the soil surface), a little more increased weight was detected in S173 and the content of total non structural carbohydrate (TNC) was several-fold higher in S173 compared to that of G174. A large amount of accumulation of photosynthate in stock was regarded as one of the important factors determining the initial and early growth of ratoons. 4) S173 was characterized by having the preferential distribution of photosynthate into two different parts, panicle and stock, and this may allow S173 to show a coincidental realization of high seed yield production and growth perenniality.","1997","2015-06-01 17:27:45","2015-06-01 22:46:02","","125-130","","3-4","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199799542084","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voluntary intake of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, and nitrogen balance were determined for hay alone (CONTROL), hay plus eastern gamagrass grain (GGG), and hay plus cottonseed meal (CSM) treatments. Organic matter intake of supplemented lambs (25.7 g/kg BW) was higher (p<0.001) than lambs fed only hay (20.6 g/kg BW), There was no difference (p=0.22) in OM intake between GGG and CSM supplement treatments. Total tract digestibility of OM differed (p<0.001) among the GGG (61.8%), CSM (58.6%), and CONTROL (54.9%) treatments. However, differences in digestibility may be the result of addition of highly digestible protein and carbohydrate supplements, rather than an increase in digestibility of the hay. Digestibility of NDF was greater (p=0.01) for supplemented lambs (58.4%) than unsupplemented lambs (57.4%) and differed (p=0.04) between the CSM (59.1%) and GGG (57.7%) treatments. Addition of the supplements improved (p<0.001) the digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) of the total diet. The diet with GGG had more (p<0.001) favorable DE and ME values than the CSM supplemented ration. Nitrogen balance was more favorable (p<0.001) for supplemented (+5.7 g N/day) than for unsupplemented lambs (+1.7 g N/day), Lambs supplemented with GGG (+6.3 g N/day) retained more (p=0.01) nitrogen than lambs supplemented with CSM (+5.0 g N/day) even though nitrogen intake was similar (p=0.98), The difference in the nitrogen retention between the supplement treatments was the result of higher (p=0.01) urinary nitrogen excretion from the CSM as compared to the GGG treatment, while fecal nitrogen excretion was similar (p=0.63) for both supplement treatments. Eastern gamagrass grain was comparable to CSM as a protein supplement for moderate to low quality hay.","DEC 1  1998","2015-06-01 17:19:18","2015-06-01 22:46:46","","95-102","","1-2","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000077482000009","","","","Digestibility; Nitrogen balance; perennial W/1 grain; Protein; ScienceDirect; search.grain; SPV; Supplement; Tripsacum dactyloides; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Black Mountain) was grazed by Merino wether weaners at stocking rates of 10-17 animals/ha to test the suggestion that persistence might be enhanced by occasional deferment of grazing to encourage seedling germination. In the first of these experiments (experiment 1), designed to compare secale and phalaris, when accompanied by white and subterranean clovers, growth and survival of both grasses was poor, despite the application of >600 kg/ha superphosphate and the experiment was abandoned after 2 years. A subsequent pot trial (experiment 2) with secale grown in soil from the experimental site, where the fertiliser had been applied, showed a large growth response to additional phosphorus. Because inadequate soil fertility may have been the cause of poor grass persistence in experiment 1, a second field experiment (experiment 3) was established on the same site to compare secale, perennial ryegrass and cocksfoot, each accompanied by white and subterranean clovers and with the application of a further 850 kg/ha superphosphate over 3 years. Initial growth of all the grasses was good and animal production on the secale and ryegrass plots was high (up to 100 kg/ha greasy wool and 300 kg/ha Liveweight gain). Secale failed to survive more than 3 years, despite deferment of grazing and it may be that persistence depends more on the reliability of autumn rainfall. However, mean weight gain from the clovers and volunteer grasses on the secale plots in the fourth year was as high as from the ryegrass plots and double that from the cocksfoot plots, which became increasingly cocksfoot-dominant. While the results indicate a need for more work on the fertiliser requirements of perennial grasses on these soils, they also raise questions about whether these grasses benefit animal production sufficiently to justify the cost of establishing them.","1997","2015-06-01 17:31:57","2015-06-01 17:31:57","","19-25","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1997WM66400003","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, under zero tillage were compared two herbicide application and sowing. Also, under zero tillage were compared two herbicides before sowing: paraquat 1 l ai/ha first year and 0.48 l ai the following years and glyphosate 1.08 ae/ha first year and 0.72 l ae/ha the following year. Corn management was identical in every treatment except in the case of irrigation, which was by furrow in minimum and traditional tillage and by flood in the case of zero tillage. Glyphosate was more effective controlling all weeds and particularly perennial grasses (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers: and Lolium perenne L.) than paraquat. Also, it was observed a significantly better weed control on zero tillage in a four year comparison over minimum and traditional tillage. However, there were no significant differences between treatments on plant population, except the first year of comparison, in which a reduced plant population was observed in zero tillage. Also, yield of corn was the same regardless the systems of soil management comparing four seasons. Zero tillage increased somewhat the soil organic matter content and bulk density of soil and slightly decreased water infiltration through the soil profile after four years.

Typically, following a mid-September sowing date, only 30-40 growing days are available for cool-season grass establishment. As a consequence, a one year growing season, without livestock grazing pressures, is necessary to provide good stand establishment of the perennial cool-season species. The opposite is true for the case where cool-season annuals like winter wheat or rye can be grazed fairly heavily following a period of stand establishment. The inability of a livestock producer to heavily graze a newly sown perennial cool-season grass forage pasture provides not only a loss of land resources for grazing, but limits the sites where a cattleman can sow pasture to cool-season species and continue to graze his livestock. This study was conducted to determine if perennial cool-season grass forages could compete and become established when inter-seeded with winter wheat as a companion species. Stand counts were performed on each three replicate plots of eighty-two perennial cool-season cultivars and experimental germplasms to determine stand establishment and seedling survival rates. Depending on the species, stand counts of plants per m 2 obtained in the fall of 2001 ranged from 0, with no survival, to a value of 40, which indicates a 100%, fully established stand. Results from this study indicate that crested wheatgrass, tall wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, smooth bromegrass and western wheatgrass, when inter-seeded and under competition with winter wheat, can be successfully established and provide grazing resources for livestock producers in the Southern Plains during the first year of sowing.","2002","2015-06-01 20:43:33","2015-06-02 02:04:52","","27-46","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Companion crop; Cool-season; Grass forages; Perennial; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study revealed that C. partellus is expanding its distribution into the high elevations of the eastern Highveld region of South Africa. The only stem borer already found there (elevation 1,600 m) is Busseola fusca (Fuller). After C. partellus invaded the region, it rapidly increased its share of the total borer population every pear. On maize, it reached 32% of the total borer population within 6 yr and on grain sorghum 59% within 7 yr. The most rapid population increase by C. partellus occurred on the ratoon grain sorghum crop. Within 2 yr it became the predominant borer, constituting approximate to 90% of the total stem borer population. C. partellus has proven to be an efficient colonizer, and it seems to be displacing the indigenous B. fusca. C. partellus survives the dry winters (at subzero temperatures) of the Highveld region in South Africa by diapausing low in the dry stalks, often beneath the soil. Hibernating larval populations of C. partellus terminate diapause and emerge as moths approximate to 1 mo earlier than B. fusca. This enables C. partellus to infest the grain sorghum ratoon crop before B. fusca, thus becoming the predominant borer in this niche. The life cycle of C. partellus is 3 wk shorter than that of B. fusca, which gives it a further competitive advantage because of its higher potential rate of increase.","SEP  1997","2015-06-01 19:08:56","2015-06-01 22:51:32","","619-624","","5","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1997YH00300011","","","","Busseola fusca; Chilo partellus; Competitive displacement; Maize; Scopus; search.sorghum; sorghum; SPV; Stem borer; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study was conducted for the investigation of the persistence, the dry matter accumulation potential and the competitive ability of perennial grain crops in different mixtures on marginal lands. Factorial field experiments were conducted at two sites with marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum Guss.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium Host.), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.) and linseed (Linum perenne L.). In some stands white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved nitrogen supply. Intermediate wheatgrass and lupine demonstrated the best persistence among the examined species. Rye showed a satisfactory ability to persist only when grown in mixture with legumes. Apparently the persistence of rye was influenced positively from nitrogen fixed by the legumes. Linseed showed only on one location a small ability for perennialism, while on the other location it did not persist at all. Both grass species were in most cases stronger competitors than the companion species. In various mixtures a positive effect of legumes on the growth of the grass species was evident. Therefore even using grain crop mixtures of grasses and legumes seem to be promising for marginal lands. Since species' competitive ability depends to a large extent on the site, statements about the suitability of different species for growing together in mixtures are not generally possible, but only with reference to a specific site.","2002","2015-06-01 20:24:50","2015-06-01 22:48:33","","107-114","","3-4","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much smaller amounts of p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were released from the roots of red clover by NaOH, than from perennial ryegrass. Roots of both species were incubated with soil for up to 33 weeks, under both well-aerated and waterlogged conditions, and changes in the composition of the organic matter of the light fraction were examined. In general, the proportions of lignin increased and pectin decreased, and there was some tendency for hemicellulose to increase and cellulose to decrease. N, S and P in the organic matter of the light fraction decreased initially and then increased to reach, after 33 weeks, values greater than those in the roots. Whether the soil was well-aerated or waterlogged had little effect on these changes. Incubation with red clover roots increased considerably the amounts of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillin and syringic acid extracted from the soil (after removal of the light fraction) by a buffer solution of pH 8.4.

From 1986 to 1992 I monitored seasonal net aboveground production and species composition at four sites with soils that differed in texture and percent organic matter, pH, and concentrations of NH4, total N, K, Ca, Mg, and SO4. Four years of the survey featured above normal precipitation and 3 were drought years. August standing crop averaged 566 +/- 307, 419 +/- 143, 268 +/- 158, and 232 +/- 148 g . m(-2) at the four sites. Production generally increased with soil fertility (i.e., percent organic matter, total N, and K) and precipitation. The two more productive sites featured higher percentages of grass biomass, but legumes were rare. The site with the lowest soil N supported the consistently highest legume biomass and lowest grass biomass among sites. The least productive site displayed the highest percentage of composites. Species evenness, but not richness, was inversely related to August biomass for all sites. There were significant differences in production across years, as well as in percentages of grass, legume, and composite biomass. Total plot richness ranged from 24 to 40 species sampled per year at site 2 to 51-53 species at site 4, and tended to decline in the dry year 1989. Poor soils, although less productive overall, appear to prevent dominance by tall grasses and thereby maintain relatively more diverse spring and summer floras. Increased light availability near the soil surface probably enables the persistence of low-growing plants. Evenness, but not richness, varied among sites. The patterns of plant community composition have implications for restoration ecology as well as the design of prairielike perennial grain mixtures.","OCT  1995","2015-06-01 17:19:38","2015-06-01 17:19:38","","1635-1644","","10","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1995RZ63600015","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically of interest is the extent to which the peak capacity of the 2D separation space has been utilized and the procedure by which the derivative standards are identified in the 2D separations using the mass spectral information. The resulting 2D separation is found to make extensive use of the GC × GC separation space provided by the complementary stationary phases employed. Second, in order to demonstrate GC × GC/TOFMS on two real sample types, trimethylsilyl metabolite derivatives were analyzed from extracts of common lawn grass samples (i.e., perennial rye grass), as a means to provide insight into both the pre and post harvest physiology. Various chemical components in the two rye grass extract samples were found to either emerge or disappear in relation to the trauma response. For example, a significant difference in the peak for the TMS derivative of malic acid was found. The successful analysis of various components was readily facilitated by the 2D separation, while a 1D separation would have produced too much peak overlap, thus impeding the analysis. The importance of using a GC × GC separation approach for the analysis of complex samples, such as metabolite extracts, is therefore demonstrated. The real-time analysis capability of GC × GC/TOFMS for multidimensional metabolite analysis makes this technique well suited to the high-throughput analysis of metabolomic samples, especially compared to slower, stopped-flow type separation approaches.","January 30, 2005","2015-06-01 19:32:43","2015-06-01 19:32:43","","380-388","","2","65","","Talanta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Amino acids; Comprehensive two-dimensional separation; GC × GC/TOFMS; Metabolites; Organic acids; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; search.rye; SPV; Sugars; Time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Two-dimensional gas chromatography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents literature data on crop parameters and environmental conditions that determine transpiration for four crops (oil palm, cocoa, maize and rice) and evaporation. Transpiration at leaf scale and soil evaporation as well as evaporation of intercepted rainfall have been computed using these data and are scaled-up to canopy scale. The objective is to quantify evapotranspiration of the crops under identical environmental conditions at two temporal scales: daily and annual evapotranspiration. Variation among crops in transpiration at leaf scale owing to crop characteristics is levelled out in scaling up to canopy scale. Differences in annual evapotranspiration between perennial and annual crops mainly are due to the fact that perennial crops transpire during the dry season, although at low rates, but still considerably higher than evaporation rates of bare and dry soils. Apparently, the degree of soil cover with vegetation in space and in time is of major importance to evaluate differences in annual evapotranspiration caused by changes in land use.","June 1996","2015-06-01 19:21:39","2015-06-01 19:21:39","","17-34","","1–2","31","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual; Canopy evapotranspiration; Cocoa; Daily; Leaf; Maize; Oil palm; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; West Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No fertilization (control) and mineral fertilization alone (NPK) plots were installed for comparison. Methane flux which was investigated by the closed chamber method during rice cultivation was significantly increased by chemical fertilization to ca. 80–250% over the control (138–141 kg CH4 ha−1), but increased more markedly by cover crop biomass addition to ca. 28–121% over the NPK treatment. Milk vetch was more effective on stimulating less CH4 emission (28–61% increase over NPK) and improving rice productivity (18–31% increase over NPK) than rye (86–121% increase of CH4 emission and −3–6% of yield increase over NPK). As a result, the total CH4 flux per grain yield was significantly increased by rye addition, but were similar between the NPK + milk vetch and NPK treatments.

The diet consisted of either rye, perennial rye-grass, cocksfoot, water meadow-grass, or reed-grass. Neither the general shape of the growth curve nor the duration of the developmental period are influenced by these diets. Considerable diet-specific differences in amounts of food consumed as well as digested are estimated. Although explanations for these differences cannot be given, some probable causes are discussed: water content of the food, and ""transition effect"" of dietary change. The approximate digestibility of the food is higher in larvae than in adults during their somatic growth, which will reflect a greater digestive capacity in larvae. This digestive capacity remains constant within each developmental period, but its absolute value may differ between the two periods investigated and is dependent on the kind of food offered. The efficiency of conversion of ingested food as well as digested food to body substance are greater for water meadow-grass and particularly for rye than for the other grasses.","1976","2015-06-01 20:32:30","2015-06-02 02:04:42","","130-138","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It separates the dual functions required of the soil surface to carry heavy traffic and establish/grow crop plants. The benefits include fuel savings, spray savings, more accurate and timely operations, increased sowing opportunities, compaction control, less need for tillage, increased rainfall infiltration, efficient field layouts, improved fallow and crop management, night operations, convenient crop inspections, and increased options for erosion control. Benefits specific to sorghum growing are better crop establishment with more accurate and reliable plant populations, increased yields, more accurate placement of herbicides and pesticides, and an ideal farming system for ratoon sorghum. Problems include the needs for matching equipment, reliable guidance systems, weed control in the wheel tracks, and an alternative depth control system. While farmers accept the concepts and recognise the benefits, the transition to a new system may be the greatest challenge to adoption. It is suggested that an integrated approach involving growers, researchers, machinery company representatives, consultants and extension officers may increase adoption of controlled traffic systems.","1996","2015-06-01 19:09:04","2015-06-01 19:09:04","","403-407","","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19970701554","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By contrast, there is untapped diversity in the more than 20 wild species of Oryza, some having been collected from just a few coastal locations (e.g. Oryza schlechteri), while others are widely distributed (e.g. Oryza nivara and Oryza rufipogon). The extent of DNA sequence diversity and phenotypic variation is still being established in wild Oryza, with genetic barriers suggesting a vast range of morphologies and function even within species, such as has been demonstrated for Oryza meridionalis. With increasing climate variability and attempts to make more marginal land arable, abiotic and biotic stresses will be managed over the coming decades by tapping into the genetic diversity of wild relatives of O. sativa. To help create a more targeted approach to sourcing wild rice germplasm for abiotic stress tolerance, we have created a climate distribution map by plotting the natural occurrence of all Oryza species against corresponding temperature and moisture data. We then discuss interspecific variation in phenotype and its significance for rice, followed by a discussion of ways to integrate germplasm from wild relatives into domesticated rice.","February 2014","2015-06-01 19:20:55","2015-06-01 19:20:55","","48-58","","0","215–216","","Plant Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biogeography; Breeding; Climatic distribution; Introgression; Oryza; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Wild relatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10–20% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change.","June 2009","2015-06-01 19:25:13","2015-06-01 19:25:13","","427-437","","4","12","","Environmental Science & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural systems; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Poverty; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Season failure; SPV; Sub-Saharan Africa; Targeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This requires a holistic approach to agricultural research that is oriented towards the combination of crop enterprises encountered on, or suitable for, the different land types in rice-growing regions. In formulating such an approach, IRRI's cropping systems programme has tried to avoid complex computational and information processing techniques. Co-operation with representatives from national research organisations in south and southeast Asia (Cropping Systems Working Group, 1975) led to the formulation of a site-related cropping systems research methodology that emphasises decentralised research in the farm community. This methodology is conceptually based on the cropping system as an open, reactive system. The research activities therefore focus on the description and classification of the environment, on the design of improved cropping systems, on their on-farm testing and on methods for the formulation of production programmes.","April 1979","2015-06-01 19:39:30","2015-06-01 19:39:30","","135-153","","2","4","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The yields of wheat in these fields were steadily increased from 19.5 cntr/ha in 1957 to 33.2 cntr/ha in 1961. The great increase in the yields during this period is attributed largely to replacement of the old rotation system involving periodic planting of perennial grasses with a new system of planting a continuous succession of crops of legumes, corn and winter wheat or other cereal grains. Comparative data are presented which clearly show that the old grassland system is definitely inferior to the new system for obtaining the best yields of winter wheat in the regions of Western Siberia and Kazakhstan.

However, the full potential is rarely achieved because of various biotic and abiotic constraints. Analysis of 25 experiments found a slight increase in CA crop yields over time relative to CVT, indicating that CA can compete with CVT on a purely crop production basis and also has well-established environmental benefits. Evolved weed resistance to herbicides remains one of the greatest challenges to CA yields and long-term sustainability, yet there are some successful management stories. Worldwide adoption of CA is increasing; however, uptake in some regions is slow or non-existent. A lack of information on the effects and interactions of minimal soil disturbance, permanent residue cover, planned crop rotations and integrated weed management, which are key CA components, can hinder its adoption. This is because these interactions can have positive and negative effects depending on regional conditions. The positive impacts should be exploited through systems research to enhance CA crop yields. A greater focus on the influence of residue and weed management components as well as breeding for varieties adapted to biotic and abiotic stresses often associated with CA is required.","December 2011","2015-06-01 19:22:59","2015-06-01 19:22:59","","172-183","","0","117","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Allelopathy; Herbicide resistance; No-tillage; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rainfall; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil compaction; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Replacing some wheat pasture with perennial cool-season grasses (PCSGs) could reduce uncertainties of sufficient fall forage and annual tillage operations. Wheat forage is capable of producing stocker weight gains >1.4 kg d(-1), but wheat can accumulate nitrate that poses a health risk to stockers. Levels of crude protein (CP) and nitrate in fall forage clipped 4 yr (2002-2005), from replicated pastures of winter wheat and two PCSG pastures established in 2001 ('Jose' tall wheatgrass [Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Z.-W. Liu & R.-C. Wang], 'Manska' intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey], and one PCSG pasture established in 2002 ['Lincoln' smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss)], were compared. Forage levels of CP in PCSGs were >148 g kg(-1) dry wt., but were 21 to 37% less than that of wheat (244 3 g kg-1). Mean nitrate-N levels of wheat were 400, 1400, 4600, and 840 mg kg(-1) in 2002 through 2005, respectively. Among the PCSGs, nitrate-N did not exceed 660 mg kg(-1). The CP levels of PCSGs were often substantially less than that of wheat, but were sufficient for growth of stocker calves. Nitrate risks that sometimes occurred with wheat would make PCSGs a safer choice for pasture.","SEP-OCT  2010","2015-06-01 17:46:22","2015-06-01 22:50:54","","2140-2147","","5","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000281060300062","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","animal health; Bromus inermis; cattle feeding; cool season grasses; crude protein; forage grasses; liveweight gain; nitrate nitrogen; nitrogen content; Oklahoma; pastures; perennials; species differences; stocker cattle; Thinopyrum intermedium; Thinopyrum ponticum; tillage; Triticum aestivum; winter wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Culture-based and culture-independent microbiological methods were used to determine if mixed plant treatments stimulate different microbial communities and catabolic genotypes in comparison to individual plant species that comprise the mix. DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes revealed that alfalfa (Medicago sativa) had a dominant effect on the structure of rhizosphere microbial communities in mixed plant treatments, stimulating relative increases in specific Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria populations. Alfalfa and mixes containing alfalfa, while supporting 100 times more culturable PAH degraders than other treatments, exhibited only 10% TPH reduction, less than all planted treatments except perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne). Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) reduction was greatest in single-species grass treatments, with creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra) reducing the TPH concentration by 50% after 4.5 months.

A","","","","","In order to test whether it was possible to combine the desirable characteristics of S. vulgare with the perennial habit, tolerance of low temperature and general hardiness of S. montanum, crosses were made between the two species. Petkus winter rye, representing S. vulgare, was used as the female parent and was cut back two days before fully earing to delay its development until the pollen of S. montanum should have matured. From a total of 1620 flowers pollinated 17 seeds developed normally. The F 1 hybrids were all more or less intermediate and uniform, 80-100 cm. high, with glabrous ears which were brittle and more like those of S. montanum and had a bristly appearance at flowering time. The leaves were densely covered with hairs on the upper surface. The hybrids were late in maturing and out of 42 normally developed ears (with 1532 spikelets) only 15 ears set seed with an average of about 44 normal grains which were of a good size and relatively well-filled. The seeds from the F 1 yielded 26 plants which developed more or less normally, the rest dying off at various stages. In the F 2, segregation was observed for ear characters, brittleness, pubescence of the leaves, type of stem, growth and general development, perennial and annual habit and many other features. A study of the F 2 material indicated that perennial habit behaved as a recessive character and that from crosses made on a large scale cultivated perennial rye types can be obtained by selection. Brittleness of the ear appeared to be dominant to toughness, though some medium tough ears were also observed in the F 2. The type of ear and awns of S. montanum was dominant, as were also glabrousness under the ear and pubescent leaves, though in the latter case segregation was not clear-cut and inheritance is probably complicated. A cytological examination of the first hybrid generation shewed irregularity at all stages of the first and second division and abnormalities in the number of bivalents formed and in chromosome separation to the poles, resulting in the formation of pollen which was irregular in the number of its chromosomes and in size and form. Its viability varied from 5-38.3 per cent.","1935","2015-06-01 17:39:51","2015-06-01 17:39:51","","233-38","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19361600869","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, cim 1 mRNA accumulation was stimulated in the absence of cytokinin by staurosporine (an inhibitor of protein kinases) and inhibited in the presence of cytokinin by okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a), suggesting that cim 1 accumulation in response to cytokinin is dependent on cytokinin-induced dephosphorylation of one or more cellular proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cim 1 protein product, derived from the complete nucleotide sequence of a cim 1 cDNA, was 40% identical to that of a perennial rye grass pollen allergen cDNA (Lol Pl).

Quite high numbers of bivalents were present in the F 1 but in spite of this the reduction division was very irregular and considerable sterility resulted. Similar results were obtained with certain other species of both Triticum and Agropyrum. The F 1 plants were mainly sterile but certain individuals were more fertile than others on pollination with the parents; the plants produced had chromosome numbers that indicated an origin from an unreduced female gamete, being sesquidiploids. The same occurred on pollinating with a third species, so that from the hybrid T. durum x A. intermedium by pollination with T. vulgare a triple hybrid with 56 chromosomes was obtained and by pollination with A. elongatum a triple hybrid with 2n = 70. This latter hybrid was very vigourous in growth, wheat-like in type, perennial and fairly fertile. In these various hybrids pairing occurred between certain of the Triticum and Agropyrum genoms, some of the extra Agropyrum chromosomes remaining as univalents and others pairing autosyndetically. Thus the A, B and D genoms are considered to be homologous in the two genera, though considerably modified during evolution. Two further genoms X 1 and X 2 are peculiar to Agropyrum and not found in wheat at all. By back-crossing the hybrids to the F 1 plants producing unreduced gametes it is hoped to obtain balanced chromosome types that combine the desirable qualities of the wheat parent with the perennial habit and hardiness of the Agropyrum.","1936","2015-06-01 17:57:12","2015-06-01 17:57:12","","25-30","","Issue 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19371600951","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feces from cows fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage (AS)-based diets generally lead to higher soil IN levels than soils amended with feces from corn (Zea mays L.) silage (CS)-based diets, especially in soils amended with feces from CS-low crude protein (LCP) diets; feces from AS-based diets increased plant DM and N uptake; after application to a silt loam, feces from high crude protein (HCP) diets resulted in greater soil IN levels than feces from LCP diets; and feces from LCP diets did not impact soil IN but decreased plant DM and N uptake. Carbon to N (C/N) ratios of applied feces were found to be significant predictors of plant DM and N uptake. There appears to be a range of dietary options that satisfy nutritional requirements of high-producing dairy cows and produce feces having differential effects on soil N mineralization and plant N uptake after application to soil.","MAY-JUN  2006","2015-06-01 19:08:32","2015-06-01 22:52:18","","786-794","","3","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000237344500010","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); TX (ratoon* N5 sorghum); WOS","alfalfa silage; Avena sativa; biogeochemical cycles; carbon; chemical composition; corn silage; crop yield; crude protein; dairy cows; diet; dry matter content; feces; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient uptake; oats; sandy loam soils; silt loam soils; soil nutrient dynamics; Sorghum bicolor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No information is available on these impacts when manure is applied to soils at different rates and frequencies. Manure from lactating dairy cows (Bos taurus) fed three diets differing in crude protein (CP) content were applied to a Plano (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls) and a Rosholt (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs) sod at two application rates (225 or 450 kg total N ha(-1)) and three application frequencies (once, twice, or thrice). Oat (Avena sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and sorghum ratoon were grown in succession during a 170-d period. Plant responses to manure from different CP diets were much less than responses due to soil type and manure application rate and frequency. Manure N uptake efficiency by plants was greatest for manure derived from a low-CP diet than manure derived from either the medium- or high-CP diets. Manure application rate and frequency increased NO3 levels in oat and sorghum shoots, which if used as forage could have detrimental impacts on dairy cow health. No significant differences were measured in secondcrop (sorghum) yield or N uptake due to a previous manure application at either N application rate. Third-crop (sorghum ratoon) yield and N uptake were significantly increased, however, due to previous manure applications, but only in pots that received two manure applications at the high rate. Longer term, repeated applications of dairy manure derived from different diets at lower rates could provide more pronounced impacts on plants and soils than those observed during this relatively short-term greenhouse study.","JUL-AUG  2007","2015-06-01 19:08:30","2015-06-01 22:53:02","","1306-1313","","4","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000248103200026","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); TX (ratoon* N5 sorghum); WOS","agricultural soils; application rate; Avena sativa; crop production; crop yield; crude protein; dairy cows; dairy manure; diet; fertilizer application; grain sorghum; greenhouse experimentation; nitrates; nitrogen; nutrient uptake; oats; protein content; shoots; soil chemical properties; Sorghum bicolor; Wisconsin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present investigations, field experiments were conducted to study the incidence and damage caused by Clavigralla tomentoscollis Germ. and C. shadabi, after flowering, on cowpea intercropped with maize. It was evident from the present studies that C. tomentoscollis and C. shadabi were more prevalent on cowpea during the first season rather than during the second season. Both species had a preference for feeding on cowpea intercropped with maize than when it was grown in pure stands. Consequently more pod damage was recorded on cowpea planted with maize.

Cytogenetics, it is contended, was of little use in directing hybridological researches, as the type of reduction division proved to vary not only within the same hybrid family, but also as broadly within the same individuals; fertility and sterility in hybrids showed no reliable relation to bivalent number and some cases are on record in which univalent hybrids showed relatively high fertility; moreover, fertility seemed to increase with age in perennial Triticum x Agropyrum hybrids; for instance, a perennial hybrid (with annual shoots) was entirely sterile in the first year, but showed almost normal fertility in the following year. Darwin's ideas of selective properties in cross pollination (prepotency) and biological compatibility have been substantiated in recent investigations; for this reason the author reconstructed his hybridological researches; the new breeding schemes assume a free cross pollination, but in such a manner that the same pair is crossed only once. In many cases sterility (biological incompatibility) could be overcome by Micurin's method of vegetative approach (by means of grafting the components). This method was successfully used by the author in distant hybridizations involving annual leguminous plants ( Pisum, Lens, Lupinus, Vicia, Melilotus, etc.) with yellow and white Acacia and some other woody plants. The same method of overcoming incompatibility is desired in grass hybridization ( Agropyrum, Elymus and Triticum), but there are difficulties in technique. In preliminary researches along these lines the outstanding importance of chlorophyll was established in grafting. Etiolated components could not be grafted; only parts rich in chlorophyll showed a tendency to form callus if the conditions subsequent to grafting fostered chlorophyll formation in the callus. The technique of grafting had accordingly to be modified. The components grafted, moreover, must be at the same developmental phase; young tissues formed callus more readily. In conclusion, it is emphasized once more that agrobiological research must be based upon the ideas of Darwin, Timirjazev and Micurin if it is to become progressive as well as useful.-M.A.O.","1939","2015-06-01 17:56:40","2015-06-01 17:56:40","","71-82","","5-6 (26-27)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19410700531","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lysenko.","Pravda","","","","","Lysenko has created a theory of directed change of organisms, which provides means for mastering tne natural process of creation of new forms. Planned changes of organisms and the inheritance of these induced changes is possible because the organism is changed first in accordance with changes in its environment and then the changed organisn produces sex cells which diuer correspondingly from the original sex cells. Environment has a decisive role in these planned changes. Spring forms of grain crops, obtained from winter crops by regulating the environment, have the growth habits of ordinary spring crops. Changed organisms, however, being unstable, are highly susceptible to environmental influence. The laws of dominance and purity of the gametes are the basic principles of Morganism. Morganists reject the possibility of directed dominance in the F Variation in the F 2 is explained by them as a result of random segregation of chromosomes at meiosis. It has been shown, however, that in crosses between winter and spring cereal varieties, spring winter types can be obtained at will in the F 1 For instance spring rye, sown in late autumn, and pollinated in the following year by winter varieties, gives a large number of F 1 hybrids in which the winter habit is dominant. Micuru's methods are equally efficacious in controlling F 2 variation. It has been found in experiments with hybrid onions, that different offspring are obtained from the seed-propagated plants and plants reproduced from the bulbs. The offspring differed in both shape and colour. The differences persisted in the following generations independently of the method of reproduction. Morgano-Mendelians believe that the initiation of a new life cycle depends on the rejuveniz-ing effect of meiosis. Soviet scientists attribute rejuvenation both to sex cells and to the organs of vegetative reproduction. To establish this point onions producing bulbs as well as seed were investigated. It was found that the young plants, both from the bulb and from the seeds, required the same sort of environmental conditions for the early stages of development. F 1 interspecific hybrids are often sterile; Morgano-Mendelians treat the plants chemically in order to double their chromosome numbers. The author, however, has produced two centners of seed of F l hybrids obtained from crosses of hard and soft wheat. The hybrid plants were fertile and many hybrids produced as many as. 1500 grains. Reference is made to Triticum-Agropyron hybiids, but it is stated that so far no hardy perennial wheats are forthcoming.","1948","2015-06-01 17:55:02","2015-06-01 17:55:02","","p-2 p","","220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19481602848","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified impacts of perennial WSGs and row crops on soil wind erodibility parameters (erodible fraction, geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates, and aggregate stability) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration under a dedicated bioenergy crop experiment in eastern Kansas after 4 and 5 yr of management. Soil properties were measured under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and annual row crops including continuous corn (Zea mays L.), photoperiod sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sweet sorghum, and grain sorghum. Perennial WSGs reduced wind erodible fraction by 1.08 to 1.16 times compared with row crops. The geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates under switchgrass and miscanthus was 2.8 to 4.5 times greater than under row crops. Dry soil aggregate stability under miscanthus and big bluestem was greater than under row crops. After 5 yr, differences in SOC concentration between WSGs and row crops were not statistically significant for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Photoperiod sensitive and sweet sorghum had greater biomass yield than WSGs. In 2011, miscanthus yielded more biomass than corn by 5.3 Mg ha(-1). Overall, growing dedicated bioenergy crops can reduce the soil's susceptibility to wind erosion but may not significantly increase SOC concentration in this region in the short term.","SEP-OCT  2013","2015-06-01 17:17:42","2015-06-01 22:53:18","","1271-1276","","5","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000322620600003","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.grain; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 grain); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","aggregate stability; Andropogon gerardii; carbon; continuous cropping; corn; energy crops; erodibility; grain sorghum; Kansas; Miscanthus giganteus; Panicum virgatum; soil organic carbon; Sorghum bicolor; sweet sorghum; warm season grasses; wind erosion; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yunnan province is within this region and is a major overwintering area for S. furcifera in China. This field study was carried out over 4yr (2010-2013) and focused on S. furcifera distribution, population density, and demography, as well as the relationship between various environmental factors and the distribution and density of overwintering S. furcifera in Yunnan. Our study demonstrated that overwintering populations of S. furcifera mainly occurred in valleys and lowlands below 25.02°N and 1,680m above sea level (a.s.l.), where ratooning rice was present. The overwintering range of S. furcifera has expanded in Yunnan compared with 20yr ago, and regional climate change is believed to be the main contributing cause for this expansion. Environmental factor analysis showed that the mean air temperature of the coldest quarter and precipitation of the coldest quarter were two key factors that were strongly linked to the overwintering distribution and density of S. furcifera in Yunnan. Wintertime temperature was the principal influencing factor to determine the distribution and density of S. furcifera, while the effect of precipitation was indirect in that it influenced the insect's distribution via its host. This study documented the major overwintering areas of S. furcifera in Yunnan, which can be used to predict outbreak potential in the following spring. Hence, key climatic factors, overwintering distribution, and density of S. furcifera should be used when forecasting outbreaks in spring.","May 15 2015","2015-06-01 18:20:32","2015-06-01 18:20:32","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MEDLINE:25978998","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insects were censused 2-3 times weekly from mid-June to early August at two sites from 1991 to 1995. In the first three years, beetle density was generally low (<1 per plant), and did not differ among treatments. In the fourth year, however, beetle density peaked at 15 and 25 insects per plant at the two sites, and was highest within monoculture for most dates. In 1995, density was again low, but tended to remain higher in monoculture at one site.

Because existing research on winter food abundance and depletion is insufficient to test this hypothesis, we used harvested rice fields as model foraging habitats to determine if waste rice seed is depleted before spring migration. We sampled rice fields (n = 39 [winter 2000-2001], n = 69 [2001-2002]) to estimate seed mass when waterfowl arrived in late autumn and departed in late winter. We also placed exclosures in subsets of fields in autumn (n = 8 [2000-2001], n = 20 [2001-2002]) and compared seed mass inside and outside exclosures in late winter to estimate rice depletion attributable to waterfowl and other processes. Finally, we used an experiment to determine if the extent of rice depletion differed among fields of varying initial abundance and if the seed mass at which waterfowl ceased foraging or abandoned fields differed from a hypothesized giving-up value of 50 kg/ha. Mean seed mass was greater in late autumn 2000 than 2001 (127.0 vs. 83.9 kg/ha; P = 0.018) but decreased more during winter 2000-2001 than 2001-2002 (91.3 vs. 55.7 kg/ha) and did not differ at the end of winter (35.8 vs. 28.3 kg/ha; P = 0.651). Assuming equal loss to deterioration inside and outside exclosures, we estimated waterfowl consumed 61.3 kg/ha (48.3%) of rice present in late autumn 2000 and 21.1 kg/ha (25.1%) in 2001. When we manipulated late-autumn rice abundance, mean giving-up mass of rice seed was similar among treatments (48.7 kg/ha; P = 0.205) and did not differ from 50 kg/ha (P = 0.726). We integrated results by constructing scenarios in which waterfowl consumed rice at different times in winter, consumption and deterioration were competing risks, and consumption occurred only above 50 kg/ha. Results indicated waterfowl likely consumed available rice soon after fields were flooded and the amount consumed exceeded our empirical estimates but was less than or equal to 48% (winters pooled) of rice initially present. We suggest 1) using 50 kg/ha as a threshold below which profitability limits waterfowl feeding in MAV rice fields; 2) reducing the current estimate (130 kg/ha) of rice consumed in harvested fields to 47.2 kg/ha; and 3) increasing available rice by increasing total area of fields managed, altering management practices (e.g., staggered flooding), and exploring the potential for producing second or ratoon rice crops for waterfowl.","September 2009","2015-06-01 20:01:39","2015-06-01 22:06:26","2015-06-01 20:01:39","1125-1133","","7","73","","Journal of wildlife management","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; food availability; food depletion; habitat management; Mississippi Alluvial Valley; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); wintering waterfowl; WOS","Arkansas; carrying capacity; food availability; Louisiana; Mississippi; Missouri; overwintering; rice; seeds; waterfowl; wildlife food habits; wildlife habitats; wildlife management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intensity of reaction between the monoclonal antibody and P grisea was proportional to disease severity in perennial ryegrass inoculated with P. grisea; however. there was no reaction in dot blots of leaf tissue collected during the latent period. P grisea was detected in perennial ryegrass samples from golf course fairways affected by gray leaf spot in Connecticut. Massachusetts, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island using this procedure. The monoclonal antibody recognition system is highly sensitive to P grisea and can be used effectively for the rapid diagnosis of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf.","JUL  2003","2015-06-01 17:47:28","2015-06-01 22:55:12","","772-778","","7","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000183693400003","","","","Blast; Disease diagnosis; Immuno-detection; Magnaporthe grisea; Scopus; search.wheat; Serology; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was focused on detection of unintended effects in genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) Bar68 -1 in comparison with non-target phenotypic characteristics between Bar68 -1 and its unmodified counterpart, D68. The results showed that there were no significant differences between Bar68 -1 and D68 in most of the morphological or agronomic traits, including main culm length, main culm thickness, flag leaf length, tillering dynamics, seed setting, 1000-grain weight, grain length, grain width, length-width ratio of grain, brown rice length, brown rice width, length-width ratio of brown rice, grain yield, biomass of aerial part, yield, rate of seed germination and ratooning. There were statically significant differences between Bar68 -1 and D68 in the parameters such as flag leaf width, spikelets per panicle, panicle length and harvest index, but the values of the changed traits are within rice normal ranges and in the same scales according to GB/T 19557.7 - 2004 from Chinese standard and SES from IRRI. Therefore, these differences were not considered biologically relevant. Results indicated that the unintended effects were not detected in Bar68 -1 in this study.","MAY 18  2010","2015-06-01 18:22:10","2015-06-01 18:22:10","","1082-1088","","10","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000278594500017","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Single-species as well as multi-species EILs were determined. Across experiments, single-species EILs of leaf folder and stem borer ranged from 2.9–6.4% folded leaves and 1.9–3.0% whiteheads, respectively, while that of planthoppers varied between 5.5 and 7.3 hoppers per hill. Iso-loss equations, based on yield loss to damage functions, depicted various two-pest incidence combinations which resulted in economic damage. These joint incidence combinations showed that, although each pest was below its EIL, the combination of both pests inflicted economic damage.

It involved the farmer as an active participant in the research, with test patterns grown on his land under joint farmer-research management. Experience with the use of this methodology in developing a dryland rice-based cropping systems test site in the Philippines is discussed. The potential for increased crop productivity in the major dryland rice-producing region of eastern Batangas province, where the predominant cropping pattern involves dryland rice followed by field corn, was studied by testing the impact of these cropping pattern alternatives: following rice with field crops other than the local Orange flint corn, an intercrop pattern, and a three-crop-per-year pattern. Cooperating farmers applied the alternative patterns on 1000 m2 plots adjacent to their rice-corn plots. Some patterns showed yield instability and poor pest resistance. None had any adverse effect on the yield of the next rice crop when compared with the traditional pattern. The research opened several directions in which dryland rice-based patterns may be improved. A shift to an improved corn variety showed promise as an effective means of increasing pattern productivity. Soybeans and sorghum were the outstanding alternative crops to follow rice. Intercrops with corn were productive, but may fit only if labour requirements are not excessive and labour productivity is fairly high.","May 1981","2015-06-01 19:39:28","2015-06-01 22:55:27","","269-283","","4","6","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","Developing a 21st Century View of Agriculture and the Environment","Environmental Impact of Genetically Modified Crops","","","10.1079/9781845934095.0042","","Both poverty and malnutrition are serious problems in the world and both are interrelated. Food security for the poor depends on an adequate supply of food and/or the ability to purchase food. Unfortunately in the world today, more than 3.7 billion people are malnourished because of shortages of calories, protein, several vitamins, iron and iodine (World Health Organization, 2005; Rhodes, 2005). People can die because of shortage of any one of these nutrients or a combination of them. The total of 3.7 billion malnourished people is the largest number ever in history. In the world today, there are more than 6.5 billion humans (PRB, 2006). Based on current rates of increase, the world population is projected to double to more than 13 billion in about 58 years (PRB, 2006). At a time when the world population continues to expand at a rate of 1.2% per year, adding more than a quarter million people daily, providing adequate food becomes an increasingly difficult problem. Conceivably, the numbers of the malnourished will reach 5 billion in a few decades. Reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the US Department of Agriculture, as well as numerous other international organizations, further confirm the serious nature of the global food supply. For example, the per capita availability of world cereal grains, which make up 80% of the world's food supply, has been declining for more than two decades. This decline is taking place despite all the current agricultural and biotechnological facilities available. Malnourished people are more susceptible to numerous diseases, like malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and AIDS. The World Health Organization reports that there are more than 2.4 billion people infected with malaria, 2 billion infected with tuberculosis, 600 million infected with schistosomiasis and 40 million infected with AIDS (Pimentel et al., 2004). In this chapter, we will examine the need to increase and make more rational food production, to conserve natural resources, to reduce food (crop) losses to pests, to consider the possibility and benefits of converting annual grains into perennial grains and to consider new crops and innovative minilivestock.","2009","2015-06-01 17:18:28","2015-06-01 17:18:28","","42-58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000293121000004","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","Ferry, N.; Gatehouse, A.

In this article, we share experiences of farmer-participatory pigeonpea seed production in Fatehpur and Kanpur Dehat districts in Uttar Pradesh in India. Through farmer-participatory varietal selection trials, farmers identified NA 1, long-duration pigeonpea variety and UPAS 120, short-duration variety, as their preferred choices. Long-duration variety NA 1 was preferred because of its disease resistance, higher yield, attractive seed size and color. Farmers were organized to form cooperative societies to undertake seed production, processing and marketing at the local level. Societies were also linked with the public sector seed producing agencies to participate in the formal seed production program. The C: B ratio of seed production of NA 1 variety was 1: 5.19 as compared to 1: 2.53 of the local variety.

A previously evaluated dynamic rumen model for sheep was adopted as the fermentation component of the intake model. Intake was adjusted to reach a given level of DM fill, which is the sum of the concentrations of each of the dietary fractions within the rumen. Differential equations described the rate of change of each nutrient fraction. Genetic size scaling rules based on mature body size relationships were used to adjust rate and fill parameters of the intake model from sheep to beef cattle. Nutrient fractions were partitioned into those that flow at the particulate passage rate vs the fluid passage rate. Forty-two data points representing perennial ryegrass, wheat pasture and range grasses were used to parameterize and evaluate the model. The model was relatively sensitive to the coefficient relating DMI to particulate rate of passage, the rate constant for the use of the potentially degraded fiber fraction of the forage, and to the composition constants for the amount of carbohydrate and nitrogen in the microbial mass. Relative insensitivity was observed for starch and protein nutrient use rate constants, for the coefficient relating DMI to fluid passage rate, and for constants relating to the growth of the microbial mass in the rumen.

Seed set rate, spike length and the number of spikelets in plants belonging to different generations (C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 4) were investigated. Seed set rate was increased from 30.51% to 61.45% with the selection of plants passing over general average in respect to seed set in each generation, however, it was determined that spike length and number of spikelets decreased.

Although the diverse functions of miRNAs in model organisms have been well studied, their function in wild rice is poorly understood. In this study, high-throughput small RNA sequencing was performed to characterize tissue-specific transcriptomes in Oryza longistaminata. A total of 603 miRNAs, 380 known rice miRNAs, 72 conserved plant miRNAs, and 151 predicted novel miRNAs were identified as being expressed in aerial shoots and rhizomes. Additionally, 99 and 79 miRNAs were expressed exclusively or differentially, respectively, in the two tissues, and 144 potential targets were predicted for the differentially expressed miRNAs in the rhizomes. Functional annotation of these targets suggested that transcription factors, including squamosa promoter binding proteins and auxin response factors, function in rhizome growth and development. The expression levels of several miRNAs and target genes in the rhizomes were quantified by RT-PCR, and the results indicated the existence of complex regulatory mechanisms between the miRNAs and their targets. Eight target cleavage sites were verified by RNA ligase-mediated rapid 5′ end amplification. These results provide valuable information on the composition, expression and function of miRNAs in O. longistaminata, and will aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms of rhizome development.","April 2014","2015-06-01 19:20:53","2015-06-01 19:20:53","2014-06-01","102-109","","2–3","2","","The Crop Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep sequencing; miRNA; Oryza longistaminata; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Quantitative RT-PCR; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However the average realizable yield in DZ and WZ are 8 t ha−1 and 5 t ha−1 respectively. A survey was conducted to understand the cultural practices, farmers’ perceptions and the reasons for the yield gap in direct-seeded rice culture in Sri Lanka.

Among the farmers surveyed, only 21% of the farmers in the DZ, 13% of the farmers in the IZ, and 29% of the farmers in the WZ adhered to the recommended method of basal fertilizer application. Farmers did not adhere to the correct timing of fertilizer application. More than 50% of the cost for rice farming goes to labor, followed by cost of inputs in all climatic zones. Farmers reported that the most important production constraint for direct-seeded rice in the DZ and IZ is the non availability of reliable labor followed by soil problems and weeds. While in the WZ, it is the soil problems specially iron toxicity followed by lower soil fertility. The survey revealed that smaller land holding size, non adherence to the optimum time of farm activity initiation, less efficient use of rain water, higher seed rate and higher cost of production are a few reasons for the existing yield gap.

In grazed grasslands, trampling by large mammalian herbivores can periodically facilitate weed establishment by exposing patches of bare ground but whether an intense soil disturbance event results in a temporary increase in weed abundance or a persistent weed problem remains unclear. In May 2002, cattle trampling following heavy rain caused severe damage to nine-month old, rotationally grazed, cool-season pastures (Midwest USA). In September 2002, we compared the aboveground composition of paddocks (i.e., fenced pasture sections) that were heavily disturbed to those that received no damage. Relative to undisturbed paddocks, forage species relative cover was 17% lower in disturbed paddocks, and weed species and bare ground relative cover was 61% and 100% higher, respectively. By September 2004, paddock types did not differ in all aboveground community components. However, the abundance and species richness of weed seeds in the soil seed bank averaged respectively 82% and 30% higher in disturbed paddocks between 2003 and 2004. These findings indicate that a spatially extensive, intense soil disturbance event may soon become undetectable in components of aboveground pasture structure but can persist as an augmented weed seed bank. Because of high weed seed bank longevity, disturbances to formerly disturbed pastures would likely result in higher weed recruitment, with more species represented, than in those which lack previous disturbance. Disturbance history may thus be a useful predictor of weed community composition following subsequent disturbance. Based on empirical data supporting this proposition, we recommend that grassland managers explicitly incorporate disturbance history into dynamic management planning and do not rely exclusively on aboveground characters to evaluate the invasion status or colonization potential of an area by undesirable plants. We emphasize that the ecological legacies of past soil disturbance events cannot only influence the contemporary patterns and processes of grasslands, but importantly, affect their compositional trajectories following subsequent perturbation.","MAY  2007","2015-06-01 17:30:03","2015-06-01 17:30:03","","71-80","","1","190","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000245363200006","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decisions between cultivation of rice, annual or perennial crops, and between organic and conventional farming were compared among farmers as a function of their attitudes toward the following ecosystem services: biomass production, prevention of soil erosion, improvement of water quality, and conservation of plants and animals. Results show that decisions to plant perennial crops are most often accompanied by positive attitudes toward ecosystem services, whereas no differences were found between organic and conventional farming. In addition, latent class analysis reveals that positive attitudes toward ecosystem services are most likely held by farmers with high income, showing that financial means are key determinants of farmers' environmental attitudes.","MAR  2013","2015-06-01 17:26:09","2015-06-02 02:04:23","","422-429","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000313318000043","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Britain they are not economic pests, but they have a role in the wider ecology of agricultural ecosystems as important sources of food for birds. They have a patchy distribution across the landscape and are particularly associated with areas of cereals undersown with grass. In a survey of British farmland, larvae of these two genera were significantly more abundant in fields of sown perennial rye-grass, Lolium perenne L., than in crops of winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and spring barley, Hordeum vulgare L. Host-plant relationships and the effect of soil cultivation on overwintering survival were considered as factors underlying this distribution. In oviposition trials, perennial rye-grass was the preferred host of most species tested, and winter wheat was avoided. Growth rates and survival of larvae in performance trials were significantly higher on rye-grass than on cereals. Soil cultivation during the overwintering period caused up to 50% additional winter mortality of pupae in some years. However, in other years there was no additional mortality, indicating that another factor must be involved following the soil disturbance, such as winter frosts. The observed differences in host-suitability could strongly influence larval distribution on farms, depressing abundance in cereal habitats. Post-cultivation mortality may reinforce this effect. Varying cultivation regimes and availability of undisturbed grassland could be used to manipulate the abundance of these sawflies on farms.","2004","2015-06-01 20:29:54","2015-06-01 20:29:54","","257-269","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Cereals; Cultivation; Dolerus; Grasses; Host-plant interactions; Hymenoptera; Pachynematus; Perennial rye-grass; Sawflies; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; Tenthredinidae; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many arthropod species on farmland that are not economic pests but which have an important role in the wider ecology of agricultural ecosystems. Few of these have been studied in detail. This study investigated the factors underlying the distribution of one such group, graminivorous sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae). 2. In a farm survey, sawfly larvae of the genera Dolerus and Pachynematus were over six times more abundant in fields of sown perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne L. than in fields of spring barley, winter wheat or long-established grazing pastures. 3. In rearing trials the growth rates and survival of larvae of the two genera were high on L. perenne and low on two cereals, spring barley and winter wheat. Differences were sufficiently marked to have had a strong influence on the distribution of larvae between crops in the field. 4. In an experimental study, nearly twice as many adults emerged from uncultivated as from cultivated ground, suggesting that disturbance of the overwintering prepupae and pupae in the soil caused about 50% extra mortality. This mortality will have reinforced the effects of host-plant requirements, suppressing sawfly numbers in annually cultivated cereal fields whilst numbers built up in less-frequently cultivated grass fields. 5. Sawfly abundance is known to have declined on farmland. Our results suggest that changes in patterns of crop rotation have been the main cause of this decline. Farming practice in Britain has moved away from mixed rotations alternating cereals with undersown grass fields. Modern intensive farms grow monocultures of cereal crops or of heavily grazed grass, both poor habitats for sawflies. 6. Increasing insecticide use in cereals has probably been only a minor influence on population abundance of sawflies as wheat and barley fields are not high-quality habitats. 7. Provision of undisturbed grassy habitats would promote the conservation of graminivorous sawflies on farmland.","1999","2015-06-01 20:30:40","2015-06-01 20:30:40","","271-282","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Cereals; Dolerus; Farming practices; Pachynematus; Sawfly distribution; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The particularities of perennial life are considered here, with an emphasis on how these affect senescence at different levels of organization.

Whole-milled grain depends on preharvest drying conditions, harvest grain moisture (GM), postharvest management, and mill management. Research was conducted at the Texas A&amp;M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center near Beaumont, TX from 1989 to 1992 to evaluate the effect of drain and harvest timing on grain drying patterns of rice and whole-milled grain. The study was laid out in a split plot design with drain date as main plot and harvest date as subplots. ‘Lemont’ rice was drill-planted in (12–18.2) m×36.5 m plots on 0.2 m centers at 112 kg ha−1 and received uniform management from planting to 7 days after heading (DAH). Main plots were drained at 4-day intervals from 7 to 27 DAH (draining 24–27 DAH traditional). Subplots were harvested at 2-day intervals from 350 to 150 g kg−1 GM. Drain date did not significantly affect yield or whole-milled grain. Field drying patterns for rice were influenced by year and harvest sequence. There was no apparent relationship between key weather conditions and drying pattern. Drain time influenced drying patterns mainly for drains at 7 and 11 DAH. Drying patterns for drains of 15 and 19 DAH were similar to the more traditional 23 and 27 DAH (7–12 days before harvest) drains. GM converged for all drain dates at lower GM levels. GM declined about 22 g kg−1 per day above 230 g kg−1, but declined only about 0.6 g kg−1 per day from 23 to 15 g kg−1. Draining at 7 DAH reduced whole-milled grain at least 5%. Whole-milled grain fluctuated among years but the impact of key climatic conditions was complex. Late rainfall, after 123 days after planting (DAP), appeared to influence the maximum whole-milled grain. The influence of rainfall prior to 123 DAP was not apparent. Averaged over years, whole-milled grain increased until 133 DAP. Under the conditions of this study, whole-milled grain was similar between 170 and 200 g kg−1 GM. Rice should be harvested from 127 to 130 DAP (210–170 g kg−1 GM) to optimize whole-milled grain. These factors may have a more dramatic impact on small plot studies where treatments resulted in large GM differences than in field conditions.","March 15, 2002","2015-06-01 19:37:22","2015-06-01 19:37:22","","163-172","","2–3","74","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Drain time; Grain moisture; Oryza sativa; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Whole-milled grain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seeds used were rape, sugar-beet, perennial ryegrass, rye, maize, oats, wheat, peas, beans [ Vicia faba], and lupins. The results of (a) are tabulated. The equilibrium moisture-contents of seeds of the crops mentioned, at temperatures of 12-25degrees C. (20degrees C. for wheat), corresponding to a relative humidity of 70%, were 8, 13.3, 14.3, 15.1, 14.6, 14.0, 14.8, I5.0, 14.8 and 13.4%. respectively. Before storage, seeds should be dried to a point where their moisture content is in equilibrium with an atmospheric R.H. of 70-75% (R.H. greater than 70-75% encourages mould and bacterial development). In experiment (b) lupin, rape, bean and pea seeds with moisture-contents in equilibrium with R.H. of 63-75% were stored for 6 months at 2, 12, 18 and 25degrees C. without loss of germinative capacity; at 25degrees the germinative capacity of these seeds was slightly reduced. Oat seeds were also unaffected at the 3 lower-temperatures, but at 25degrees C. lost germinative capacity to a greater extent than the seeds of the 4 crops already mentioned. In the case of maize, perennial ryegrass, sugar-beet and rye, deterioration of germinative capacity was observed in seeds having moisture-contents in equilibrium with R.H. 65-75% stored at 18degrees C. Seeds of the last 4 crops named, with moisture-contents in equilibrium with R.H. 75-80%, showed deterioration of germinative capacity when stored at 12degrees C. Maize, ryegrass and sugar-beet seed with moisture-contents in equilibrium with R.H. 80-90% showed reduced germinative capacities when stored at 2degrees C. Thus too high a storage temperature and too high a moisture content in seeds both affected adversely the viability of hermetically stored seed. In experiment (c) seeds with moisture contents in equilibrium with R.H. 50, 70 and 90 were dried at 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70degrees C. for periods (adjusted to temperature and seed moisture-content) of 1-4 hr. Seed heated to 30degrees C. for 4 hr. (3 hr. in the case of the abnormally damp seed) did not lose germinative capacity. At 40degrees C. beans showed a slight loss of germinative capacity at all moisture-contents but no other seeds were affected. At 50degrees C. (heat applied for 2 hr.) only lupins, rape and peas showed no loss of germinative capacity. At 60 and 70degrees C. all seeds tested showed some loss of viability. The results are tabulated. In experiment (d) seeds were exposed to slow drying with air of varying R.H. until a constant moisture-content in the seed was obtained. The moisture-contents obtained were in accordance with the data obtained in (a). Thus, provided that the R.H. of the air used and the corresponding equilibrium moisture-content of the seed are known, the minimum moisture-content in seed attainable by the slow-drying process can be calculated.","1954","2015-06-01 17:37:59","2015-06-02 02:06:13","","1-2; 6-7; 21-23","","1-2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19551700329","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This character, acquired by natural selection, is the cause of perennial nature of the cereals which form new organs of vegetative reproduction during the dry summer period on old reproductive stalks, and it is especially important for cereals of the steppe, semidesert, and desert zones.

The minimum concentration of bacterium for causing Kresek symptoms was estimated at 102 cells/ml for both inoculation methods of root dipping and whole plant immersion. The infection stage of rice plant for the Kresek development was limited to the nursery stage under field conditions. Histological investigations revealed that the causal bacterium invaded the leaf blade through wounds or hydathodes and spread over the plant body through the vascular system until resulting Kresek occurrence. All the bacterial isolates collected from various localities of Sri Lanka were capable of causing Kresek. A wide range in the grade of pathogenicity existed among them. Several chemicals developed in Japan were effective for control of the Kresek phase. Recommended control measures are to select resistant varieties, to avoid excess application of nitrogenous fertilizers, to select the position of nursery bed so as to irrigate with water non-infested with the causal bacterium, to separate the irrigation system from the drainage system, to remove diseased stubble before preparing a nursery bed, to prevent the nursery bed from being submerged under irrigation water and to adopt direct sowing instead of transplanting, if possible.","1975","2015-06-01 18:42:03","2015-06-01 18:42:03","","50-123","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI197763064686","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research in Mediterranean grasslands in Galilee supports the hypothesis that rocks served as refuges from intensive grazing. Although proximity of rocks enhances early germination of Triticum, cattle grazing intensity is the major factor determining its abundance. At high grazing intensity, it is absent or survives only among rocks. At moderate grazing intensity it is common not only near rocks. In ungrazed sites it sometimes becomes dominant, but in the long term is often suppressed by perennial grasses. Fitness of Triticum plants in intensively grazed populations was only half that of plants in ungrazed populations, mainly because of damage to maturing ears. After grass fires, Triticum cover increased in ungrazed grasslands, as the cover of perennials was reduced. In ungrazed or lightly grazed grasslands, severe reductions of Triticum populations were observed during population eruptions of the Levant vole, followed by slow recovery. The dynamics of T. dicoccoides in grasslands of Galilee results from an interaction of rock microrelief, seasonal rainfall pattern, livestock grazing regime, perennial grass cover, fires, and vole eruptions. The least risky management strategy recommended for in situ conservation of Triticum populations is cattle grazing at moderate intensity, avoiding intensive grazing in the reproductive stage but also avoiding long periods without any grazing. The sensitivity of wild emmer to grazing has implications for the history of domestication and the beginnings of agriculture.","2001","2015-06-01 17:47:50","2015-06-01 17:47:50","","S43-S52","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000170937000007","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The perennial type continued vegetative growth vigorously and increased its population size in a few years. This type also produced a few seedlings. In contrast, the annual type was unsuccessful. Seeds were dispersed and buried in soil, but they did not germinate in the next season. Furthermore, the mother plants died out. Seed germination of this type was sensitive to soil substrates and seemed to be suppressed, at least partly, by an allelopathic effect of field weeds. The intermediate type after maturity covered the field with a thick layer of litter preventing weed growth. In the next season, the seeds germinated to form a new population which included a few mother plants that remained alive vegetatively. Thus, the three genotypes showed markedly different regenerating strategies. Soil-buried seeds of all types survived for years in spite of high moisture content and high temperatures.","APR  1992","2015-06-01 17:28:07","2015-06-01 17:28:07","","133-140","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1992HR81400004","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data from previous experiments were used to perform an economic analysis. Two timing applications of slag in the three production systems were analyzed: before rice, before cane, and before rice-cane rotation. Results indicate that, under the costs and prices assumed, it is more profitable to apply the slag prior to the rice planting when this crop is grown in rotation with sugarcane. The variables in the profit maximizing equations were translated into general terms to provide agronomists with the means for performing economic analyses of fertilizer responses in production systems involving a rotation. The resulting equations apply to cases where the application is done before the first crop to take advantage of residual effects and for which quadratic response functions are known.","1988","2015-06-01 19:39:16","2015-06-01 19:39:16","","179-188","","3","28","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biopiling involves the assembling of contaminated soils into piles and stimulating the biodegrading activity of microbial populations by creating near optimum growth conditions. Phytoremediation is another very successful bioremediation technique and involves the use of plants and their associated microbiomes to degrade, sequester or bio-accumulate pollutants from contaminated soil and water. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a combined phytoremediation/biopiling system, termed Ecopiling, to remediate hydrocarbon impacted industrial soil.The large scale project was carried out on a sandy loam, petroleum impacted soil [1613 mg total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) kg-1soil]. The contaminated soil was amended with chemical fertilizers, inoculated with TPH degrading bacterial consortia and then used to construct passive biopiles. Finally, a phytocap of perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens) was sown on the soil surface to complete the Ecopile. Monitoring of important physico-chemical parameters was carried out at regular intervals throughout the trial. Two years after construction the TPH levels in the petroleum impacted Ecopiles were below detectable limits in all but one subsample (152 mgTPH kg-1soil).The Ecopile system is a multi-factorial bioremediation process involving bio-stimulation, bio-augmentation and phytoremediation. One of the key advantages to this system is the reduced costs of the remediation process, as once constructed, there is little additional cost in terms of labor and maintenance (although the longer process time may incur additional monitoring costs). The other major advantage is that many ecological functions are rapidly restored to the site and the process is esthetically pleasing.","2015","2015-06-01 20:28:22","2015-06-02 02:04:14","","","","JAN","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Biopiling; Bioremediation; Field trials; Phytoremediation; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TPH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The immediate effect of a late season urea application on the processes involved in CH4 emission from a rice field was investigated on sandy loam located in the valley of River Po at Vercelli, northern Italy, and planted with rice (Oryza sativa, type japonica, variety Koral). Urea, applied at a rate of 50 kg N ha−1 on the 75th day after flooding, significantly stimulated both CH4 production and CH4 oxidation. During the following 9 days, the rates of CH4 production and CH4 oxidation in the 0–3 cm soil layer increased by 24–52 and 18–41%, respectively, of the fertilized plot compared to the unfertilized control plot. Methane oxidation on roots was also stimulated by urea, indicated by shorter lag times. Porewater concentrations of CH4 in the 0–6 cm soil layer increased with time and soil depth, but were not affected by fertilization with urea. Urea application also exhibited little impact on CH4 emission. During the 7 days following fertilization, urea only slightly reduced the CH4 flux. Ammonium originating from urea hydrolysis was completely depleted from the porewater within 3 days, mainly due to plant uptake. Fertilizer application did also not affect the contribution of CH4 oxidation to the net flux of CH4, determined by measuring δ13CH4 and by inhibition of CH4 oxidation. The absence of any effect of urea on net CH4 emission in this study was presumably caused by the rapid depletion of urea, the counterbalance between the increase of CH4 production and the increase of CH4 oxidation after fertilization, and methanogenesis in deeper soil layers.","January 2001","2015-06-01 19:37:54","2015-06-01 19:37:54","","191-199","","1–2","83","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ammonium; CH4 oxidation; CH4 production; Methane; Northern Italy; Paddy field; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of treatments to stabilize metals was assessed on the basis of metal fractionation in soil, partitioning of metals in plants, and metal uptake by the plants. Significant partitioning of Cu into immobile forms occurred as a result of the growth of Festuca rubra, and of Zn by the growth of Poa pratensis. Application of lime significantly reduced the exchangeable fraction of Zn, whereas phosphate application had an accelerating effect on exchangeable Cu. With combined application of amendments, the plant metal concentration decreased by more than 40% for Cu and 70% for Zn, compared to soils receiving no amendments.

The goal of the project is to investigate the effect of three ground covers (alfafa [ Medicago sativa], Dutch white clover [ Trifolium repens] and perennial rye [ Lolium perenne]) on the sustainability of Fraser fir Christmas tree production system. This paper reports on the effect of ground cover species and management practices on organic matter production, soil organic matter, and soil mineral nitrogen. Intercropped ground covers were mowed every 21 days, and the cut vegetation returned to the ground as green mulch. The effect of cover crop species and management practices were evaluated by quantifying the cover crop above-ground biomass production. The total amount of mineral nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were determined by chemical analyses of subsamples of materials from the cover crop biomass. The effect of cover crop on soil fertility was evaluated by monitoring changes in soil organic carbon and soil mineral nitrogen. The results indicate that cover crop species affected the amount of green manure produced and its total nitrogen and macronutrients content. Soil organic matter content was stable in the upper soil profile due to the relatively small quantities of organic matter added with the cropping system compared with the total stock of soil C. Mineral nitrogen decreased over the season due to the synchrony of cover crop decomposition, mineralization and nutrient uptake by trees in the upper profile. These results indicate that intercropping cover crops can improve soil nitrogen fertility and organic matter; however, there is strong competition for other nutrients that need to be carefully considered.","2014","2015-06-01 17:29:25","2015-06-02 00:03:39","","407-414","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20143069762","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","Biala, J.; Prange, R.; Raviv, M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate and root activity were analysed and their effects on dry matter accumulation and grain yield formation were determined. The results showed that the changing tendency in nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate in different treatments was similar under different N application modes in different developmental stages of the first cropping rice and its ratoon rice, showing an increase at the early stage, peaking at the booting stage and then gradually declining in the first cropping rice. It rapidly increased again at full-heading stage and then rapidly declined at the ripening stage of the ratoon rice. It was also found that bleeding rate continuously declined after the booting stage of the first cropping rice. However, during the ratooning cropping, it gradually increased at the budding and tillering stages, reached a peak at full-heading stage and then gradually declined at maturity. The result indicated that N supply enhanced nitrate reductase activity, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate and root activity. This therefore suggests that the proportion of N supply should be increased to enhance these parameters during the middle and late growth stages of the first cropping rice. The good pratoce in N fertilizer application can also enhance root activity, especially at the booting stage of the first cropping rice. This, in turn, can result in increased dry matter accumulation of the first cropping rice and, consequently, high grain output of the ratoon rice.","2009","2015-06-01 18:22:54","2015-06-01 18:22:54","","643-646","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093238055","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: The super rice variety Zhongzheyou 1 was used to compare the morphological and economical characteristics of first and ratoon crops for super rice sown on different sowing dates (19th, 24th and 29th March and 3rd and 8th April) in Rongshui and Sanjiang counties. Result: The results showed that the leaf-age, basal seedlings, max seedlings and effective panicles of first cropping increased with the delay of sowing dates for 5 days, while the panicle setting rate, grains per panicle, full grains per panicle and yield were decreased. The initial heading stage, full heading stage and maturity stage of first cropping also delayed for 1-4 days and the whole growth period shortened by 1-4 days. The growth duration was also delayed in ratoon cropping and most of the characteristics worsened. Under suitable climatic conditions, the stubble of ratoon rice should be kept higher to elongate growth period for getting high yield. Conclusion: The suitable sowing date for super rice planting areas with 140-250 m elevation ranged from 19-24 March and may be delayed, and the stubble height of ratoon cropping kept higher to get higher yield.","2011","2015-06-01 18:22:06","2015-06-01 18:22:06","","890-894","","8","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20113327577","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The frequency with which pasture growth commenced for each week of autumn in the years from 1965 to 1991 was assessed. The median period for the commencement of growth was in the third week of March (although the average date was March 27). Autumn data from several trials conducted over 3 decades were collated and analysed. A relationship between the grazed pasture yield (average of stocking rates plots) at the end of autumn and the rainfall showed that 200 mm of rainfall in the 3 months to the end of May was optimal while higher rainfall depressed the growth. The average daily growth rates of introduced pasture (perennial rye grass, Lolium perenne L. cv. Victorian, phalaris, Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Australian, subterranean clover Trifollum subterranneum L. and volunteer species) were measured in 2- and 4-week growth periods (G 2 and G 4, kg DM/ha.day) for the seasonal growth cycles over 4 years (1980-84 except 1983) when grazed by Merino wether sheep at stocking rates of 10, 13 or 18 sheep/ha. The rainfall throughout the study was lower than normal. Although differences in the animal performance between the stocking rates were only small, at the low stocking rate capeweed (Arctotheca calendula L.) in patches became the major component of the sward. Greater variation in G 2 than in G 4 indicated that growth responded quickly to current environmental conditions. A nonlinear regression accounted for 74% of the variance in G 2 when related to the 3 climatic factors of daylength, soil temperature at 10 cm depth and the soil moisture to a depth of 10 cm, and a plant factor of green herbage yield. The 26 % of unaccounted variance appears to be associated with an effect of stocking rate, possibly botanical composition. The botanical composition was not continuously monitored hence the only sward character included in the investigation was herbage yield. Comparison of the patterns of pasture growth from different latitudes indicated that while the growth pattern in south-western Victoria is erratic, it is intermediary between Mediterranean and temperate pasture types. Understanding this aspect has implications for improving the efficiency of animal production in this environment.","2006","2015-06-01 20:29:36","2015-06-02 02:03:58","","545-554","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Grazed pasture; Pasture growth; Pasture production; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plant growth regulator and nutrient sprays consisted of benzyladenine at 100 ppm, kinetin at 50 ppm, gibberellic acid (GA 3) at 25 ppm, urea spray at 2%, potassium nitrate at 0.5% and zinc sulfate at 1%. Irrigation treatments consisted of residual moisture (RM; no irrigation), irrigation at critical stages (ICS), irrigation at hair cracking stage (IHCS) and irrigation at saturation point (ISP). On an average of over 2 years, ISP recorded the highest grain yield (2767 kg/ha), followed by IHCS (2297 kg/ha), ICS (1602 kg/ha) and RM (1123 kg/ha). Spraying of GA 3 to main crop resulted in significantly higher ratoon grain yield (2251 kg ha -1) over other treatments. The grain yields of plants supplied with kinetin kg (2088 kg ha -1), benzyladenine (2063 kg ha -1) and urea spray (2058 kg ha -1) were similar.

However, to make it economically viable, an adequate harvesting system of the main crop is necessary. With the objective of evaluating the response of irrigated ratoon rice to the harvesting equipment, cutting height, management of stubble after harvest and fungicides, experiments were conducted during two consecutive years. In the first year, harvesters with three types of equipment (straw chopper, straw spreader, without chopper and spreader); two heights of cutting and four fungicide treatments were evaluated. In the second year, besides harvesting equipments, three stubble management practices (compactor roll, straw chaffer and without management) and five fungicide treatments were assessed. The straw chopper was superior in increasing the grain yield and quality, in comparison with normal harvest without utilizing this equipment. The fungicide applications increased grain yield and reduced incidence of grain discoloration and consequent improvement in the quality of the product. The roll compactor did not contribute to growth and yield of irrigated ratoon rice crop.

To study the effect of these grasses on yield and soil chemical and biological quality, the three species were sown in a field experiment in monoculture and in two mixtures. Within two growing seasons, the grass species tested under high soil fertility conditions did not show significant effects on most of the tested soil biological parameters. Only for the mixture of L. perenne and D. glomerata a higher soil NO3 - and mineral N content were most probably related to a higher bacterial activity, possibly induced by dying roots of L. perenne. This was the likely cause of the high aboveground dry matter yield of this mixture. The N-efficiencies of the monocultures of L. perenne, F. arundinacea and D. glomerata were not different when only considering the aboveground biomass. In L. perenne and F. arundinacea the total N in root biomass was higher while under D. glomerata the NO3 - in the soil was higher. The lower fraction of mineral N to total N for L. perenne, F. arundinacea and the mixture of the two suggests that their organic matter build-up/mineralization ratio was higher than for D. glomerata. Furthermore, the mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea showed significantly lower soil mineral N levels than the monocultures of each. We conclude that grassland systems with a mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea are more sustainable than the monocultures of each, in terms of reduction of nitrogen losses and the build-up of soil organic matter. D. glomerata should only be used in a mixture in which the companion grass(es) are maintained.","2010","2015-06-01 20:29:06","2015-06-01 23:02:31","","275-283","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Grass mixtures; Grass roots; Grass species; Microbiology; Nematodes; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic matter; Soil quality; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","belowground biomass; crop production; crop yield; Dactylis glomerata; Festuca arundinacea; Lolium perenne; nitrogen content; pasture plants; root growth; seed mixtures; soil fertility; soil nutrients; soil organic matter; soil quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eleven treatments on integrated use of N fertilizer and different organic manures were given to sugarcane (plant and ratoons) grown under the sequence. Nitrogen fertilizer (urea) was given at 75 and 150 kg/ha and P and K fertilizers were applied as basal dose at 60 kg/ha each. FYM and SPMC at 20 t/ha each as fresh weight were ploughed-mixed uniformly into the soil 10 days before planting the sugarcane variety CoLk 8102. Trash mulching was practised only in ratoons. Results showed that application of N in plant and subsequent ratoon crops significantly increased the cane yield over control. Both doses of N fertilizer varied significantly for the effects on the yield. The integrated use of N and organic manures resulted in further increase in enhanced yield over N application. No significant effect was observed on green manuring on the yield of plant cane, similarly with the residual effect on the yield of subsequent ratoon crops. The inclusion of FYM and SPMC with N fertilizer resulted in a significant increase in yield of plant crop with residual effect on ratoon yield. After 8 years of continuous cropping and manuring, significant increase of available N and K 2O was observed in most of the treatments, except control in which the available nutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu) decreased. On comparing the final soil fertility status with the initial status, no change was recorded after 8 years of continuous cropping and manuring.","2002","2015-06-01 19:08:42","2015-06-01 19:08:42","","53-55","","1/2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20043051378","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field study was conducted using two wheat varieties (Bhrikuti and Sonalika) during the 2001 and 2002 wheat seasons in Rampur, Nepal, to determine the effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and chlorine fertilization on reducing spot blotch severity in wheat, and its associated increase in grain yield. Application of N alone reduced spot blotch severity by 8% in 2002. Phosphorus fertilization had no effect on spot blotch development. The balanced application of N, P, and K reduced disease severity by 15 and 22% in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Application of KCl as well as CaCl2 reduced spot blotch severity, but the former caused 11% greater reduction than the latter. The two varieties responded differently to the mineral nutrients’ effect on spot blotch severity, suggesting the nutrients’ importance in cultivar selection when considering the effect of soil fertility on susceptibility to foliar diseases. The lower disease severity and higher grain yield observed after the application of KCl compared to CaCl2 showed that KCl should be used on K-deficient soils in the warmer wheat growing regions of South Asia where spot blotch is a serious perennial wheat disease in intensive rice–wheat cropping systems.","February 15, 2006","2015-06-01 19:35:06","2015-06-01 23:03:51","","426-430","","2–3","95","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bipolaris sorokiniana; Chlorine; Cochliobolus sativus; Foliar blight; Nitrogen; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Phosphorus; Potash; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; Spot blotch; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Wheat; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increase in the N, P and K contents in the test plant in the control object with compost did not exceed the values which were obtained in the experimental series with mineral fertilisers without compost. The obtained results are connected with the amount of nutrients being introduced into the soil material in the form of municipal sewage sludge compost and mineral fertilisers. Municipal sewage sludge compost being introduced into the soil material ignificantly increased the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by the test plant when compared with the experimental series where it had not been applied. The findings show that the largest correlation occurred between the crop yield of the test plant and the N, P and K uptake.

After foliar spray of the exogenous hormones, the tiller bud growth was completely inhibited in treatments of GA3 and NAA applies; but exogenous ABA application slowed down the growth rate of tiller bud. Both exogenous GA3 and NAA increased the ABA contents in tiller node and tiller bud and decreased the zeatin + zeatin riboside (Z+ZR) contents. Exogenous GA3 increased the IAA content in tiller node; besides, the variation of IAA and Z+ZR occurred earlier than that of ABA. Suggestively, these 3 endogenous hormones are closely associated with tiller bud growth, of which only IAA and Z+ZR play key roles, although ABA can affect the growth velocity of tiller bud. Exogenous hormones regulate tiller bud growth through changing the contents of endogenous ABA, IAA, and Z+ZR in rice plant.","April 2011","2015-06-01 19:37:42","2015-06-01 19:37:42","","670-676","","4","37","","Acta Agronomica Sinica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","hormone; outgrowth; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; tiller bud","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil core samples were collected on two dates during main crop development to estimate immature L. oryzophilus populations followed by main and ratoon crop harvests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that planting date did not affect the density-main crop yield relationship during most years and that these relationships varied substantially among years. For ratoon crop yield, an effect of main crop L. oryzophilus immature infestation was detected during some years, but the real effect of these populations on ratoon crop yield remains unclear. Using estimates of yield reduction per L. oryzophilus immature, economic injury levels were calculated. Main crop yields from treated plots and first soil core sample L. oryzophilus immature populations from untreated plots were significantly higher in plots planted at recommended dates than in plots planted earlier or later. This suggests that the presence of high populations of reproductive L. oryzophilus coincides with the period when rice fields planted at optimum dates are flooded. Results from this study reinforce the importance of managing L. oryzophilus populations when planting rice at recommended dates in southeastern Texas.","AUG  2009","2015-06-01 18:22:30","2015-06-01 18:22:30","","1536-1545","","4","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000268647600020","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PC rye was originally developed in Germany by crossing rye (Secale cereale L.) with a perennial wild rye (Secale montanum L.) and then backcrossing the F, with Secale cereale L. while selecting for a perennial nature. In field trials, ACE-1 PC rye has produced economically viable biomass yields for 3 yr under southern Alberta growing conditions. It has similar yield and quality to barley, which is grown extensively for silage in the Canadian prairies. For proper land management and adequate forage production, ACE-1 PC rye should be seeded from mid-September to mid-October in narrow (17.5 cm) rows at a seeding rate of 80 kg ha(-1). When harvested at the soft dough stage for silage it contained less crude protein (CP) and more fibre than barley; however, in vitro gas production indicates that its dry matter (DM) digestibility will be similar to that of barley.

Pers.). Effects of temperature and host plant on egg to adult mean development time, adult size and weight, and fecundity were determined. Leafhoppers on all three hosts developed fastest at the highest temperature tested (21.3 days), and slowest at the lowest temperature tested (73.2 days). The duration from first to last adult eclosion was shortest at 30°C, (11.5 days) and longest at 18°C (43 days). The sex ratio of males to females did not differ from 1:1, but males developed an average of 1.2 days faster than females on all three hosts. Mean percent development/day ranged from 1.4% at 18°C to 4.7% at 30°C. The relationship of this development rate and temperature was determined using both a linear model and a variable parameter biophysical model. Based on these models, the developmental threshold is estimated at 12-15°C. The lowest temperature yielded larger and heavier adults (312 μg, dry weight) than did the highest temperature (225 μg). Fewer leafhoppers developed on the perennial than the annuals at 30°C and fewer on the annuals than the perennial at 18°C. Our results suggest that early in the season johnsongrass and perhaps other perennials are the superior developmental hosts for this leafhopper, whereas in midsummer when temperatures are highest, annuals are the better hosts.","1990","2015-06-01 20:42:09","2015-06-01 23:13:08","","285-294","","3","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","development; fecundity; Graminella nigrifrons; host suitability; johnsongrass; Maize; Oats; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of the amount of NABD on the ratooning ability under the amount of NABD and cut leaves and spikelet treatments was investigated using 25 mid-season hybrid rice combinations. At full heading of the main crop, there existed highly significant positive correlations between the spikelets per panicle and dry weight of leaves and stem sheath per stem, and highly significant negative correlations between the spikelets per panicle and ratio of leaves to grain and stem to grain, respectively. The more spikelets were set on per panicle, the less photosynthetic matter remained in the basic stems for ratooning rice growth at harvest of main crop. Therefore, when ratooning rice is to be cultivated with cultivars having many spikelets per panicle of the main crop, more amount of NAHD will be needed. But the effect of NABD on increasing grain yield of ratooning rice were slight when photosynthetic matter that remained in the basic stems were very high or low.

Imposing water stress on the plant crop had no significant effect on shoot number development in the subsequent ratoon crop in the green-house experiment. However, a longer dry duration in a field experiment resulted in few tillers being produced by the ratoon crop implying that SV1 and SV2 ratoon crops could suffer from low tiller number under farmer ratooning strategy where there was a six-month dry period between plant and ratoon crops. There were no significant differences in grain yield between a direct seeded and a ratooned crop in both the green-house and field experiments indicating the potential of ratooning as a cropping system practice. Stalkorer control did not produce significantly higher yield compared to non-control in a field experiment indicating that stalk borer only became a problem with increased cycles of ratooning. Application of inorganic nitrogen to the ratoon crop produced significantly higher yield (P<0.05) compared to non-application indicating the need for improving fertility management in ratoon crops.

Hence, field experiments were conducted to investigate the hypothesis that the use of geotextile mats would increase aboveground biomass. We investigated the crop and weed aboveground biomass at four international sites (in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Lithuania). These sites were selected due to the severity of soil erosion problems and feasibility of using biological geotextiles in highlands. In Lithuania, imported Borassus and Buriti mats and indigenous wheat straw mats were used on roadside slopes. In China, Thailand and Vietnam, both Borassus mats and other biological geotextiles were constructed using indigenous local materials (bamboo, rice straw, wheat straw and maize stalks). Results show that biomass production was similar to 6 to 53% higher in plots with biological geotextiles compared with the plots with no geotextile treatment. In Lithuania, cover of Borassus and Buriti mats during 2006-2007 increased perennial grass productivity by similar to 50 and 18%, respectively, compared with plots with no cover (5.29 Mg ha(-1)). In China, plots with contour planting covered by rice straw mats had similar to 29% higher wheat yield than the plots with no geotextile treatment (1.98 Mg ha(-1)). Likewise, rice straw, Borassus and maize stalk mat-cover on the plots with no geotextile treatment had significant effects in increasing yields of faber bristle grass (by similar to 52%) and maize by 18% and 14% in two separate experiments in China. In Thailand, results (May 2007-June 2008) showed that plots under contour planting mulched with bamboo mats had similar to 40 and 26% higher (P< 0.05) sweet corn (Zea mays) and lablab bean (La blab purpureous) yields, respectively, than plots under contour planting only. Plots under contour planting (without a geotextile cover) had 2.5 and 0.61 Mg ha(-1) of sweet corn and lablab bean grain yield production, respectively. In Vietnam, Borassus, maize stalk and bamboo mat cover on bare plots had similar to 53,47 and 35% higher soybean yields, respectively, than the plots with no geotextile treatment (6.6 Mg ha(-1)). Increased biomass in plots under biological geotextiles was due to soil and moisture conservation. Erosion rates significantly decreased by 15-20% in Lithuania and 67-98% in South-East Asia, compared with the plots with no geotextile cover. Thus, biological geotextiles significantly increased aboveground biomass production and generally contributed to decreased soil loss under diverse soil and climatic conditions.","FEB 14  2012","2015-06-01 17:26:17","2015-06-02 02:03:51","","23-36","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000300917400004","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although birds in other agro-ecosystems may perform biological control services by controlling insect pests, the potential of blackbirds to provide these services in rice had not been evaluated. We used bird exclosures to evaluate the effects of blackbirds on stink bugs in rice and on crop damage and yields in the Everglades Agricultural Area in southern Florida. Experiments were conducted in both the main rice crop and the ratoon crop. We found no difference in the abundance of rice stink bugs (Oebalus spp.) in exclosures vs. controls, indicating that predation by birds did not reduce stink bug populations. Damage to rice by stink bugs (pecky rice) was similar between exclosures and controls, as well. However, bird damage, quantified as the percentage of panicles damaged, differed by as much as an order of magnitude in exclosures vs. controls. Mean damage estimates were 3.5% in the bird exclosures vs. 35.3% in the control for the main crop and 4.5% and 20.5%, respectively, in the exclosures and controls for the ratoon crop.

Under high concentrations (100 and 200 μM) of CdCl2, endophyte-infected plants produced more biomass and had higher values for plant height and tiller number compared to non-infected controls, but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) under 0 and 50 μM CdCl2. Anti-oxidative enzyme activities, H2O2 concentration, and chlorophylls “a” and “b” levels increased, but proline and malondialdehyde content declined in the infected plants vs. non-infected plants under high (100 and 200 μM) concentrations of CdCl2. There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) under 0 and 50 μM CdCl2. Endophyte infection was concluded to be of benefit to the growth and anti-oxidative mechanisms within A. inebrians under high concentrations exposures to CdCl2.","March 15, 2010","2015-06-01 19:25:01","2015-06-01 19:25:01","","703-709","","1–3","175","","Journal of Hazardous Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Achnatherum inebrians; Anti-oxidative enzyme; Cadmium; Endophyte; Growth; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. In the second crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was almost the same as those of Mohretsu and Tachiaoba but higher than that of Hinohikari.

In Taporuri and Mohretsu, the total estimated whole-plant TDN yield was similar in double harvesting and single harvesting. However, in Tachiaoba and Hinohikari, it was lower in double harvesting than in single harvesting. It is important to maximize the amount of nutrition in leaf and stem rather than panicle because the grain is not digested well by cattle. In the double harvesting, the total estimated leaf blade (leaf) TDN yield of Taporuri was higher than that of Hinohikari and almost the same as those of Tachiaoba and Mohretsu. The total estimated leaf sheath plus stem (stem) TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. In comparison of the total TDN yield of double harvesting with that of single harvesting, the total estimated leaf and stem TDN yields were higher in double harvesting than in single harvesting in all cultivars except for Hinohikari.

In this experiment, harvest time was considered as the main factor at two levels (T1 the first harvest on 29 th August and T2 8 th September), and harvest height was considered as sub factor (H1 level ground, H2 10 cm, H3 20 cm, H4 30 cm and H5 40 cm). Harvest time had significant effect on grain yield and harvest index. Plant height, flag leaf length, panicle length, straw yield and biological yield were not significantly affected by harvest time. Harvest time and interaction of harvest time and harvesting height had no significant influence on experimental characteristics. On the basis of the results the highest plant height, flag lead length, panicle length, grain yield, straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were obtained on 29 th August harvesting time. There were no significant differences between harvesting height treatment, but the highest yield was related to harvesting height of 40 cm.

Treatments were combinations of three input levels (organic input under conventional tillage-ORG; reduced input under no-till-RED; and high input under conventional tillage-HIGH), three crop diversities (fallow-based rotations with low crop diversity-LOW; diversified rotations using annual cereal, oilseed and pulse grain crops-DAG; and diversified rotations using annual grain and perennial forage crops-DAP), and six crop phases including green manure (GM), chem-fallow or tilled-fallow (F). Amount of nitrate-N in 0-240 cm soil was usually highest under the HIGH input-LOW crop diversity treatment and lowest under the ORG input-DAP crop diversity treatment. The distribution of nitrate-N in various soil depths suggested downward movement of nitrate-N up to 240 cm depth, especially with LOW crop diversity compared to DAP crop diversity, and with HIGH input. In some years, the ORG input systems had higher nitrate-N than the RED or HIGH input systems, which was attributed to low extractable P in soil for optimum crop growth and reduced nutrient uptake with ORG input management. Extractable P in soil was higher by a small margin for HIGH or RED input relative to ORG input in the 0-15 cm layer, suggesting little downward movement of P. Crop diversity did not affect extractable soil P due to the low baseline levels of P in this soil. The proportion of fine dry aggregates (< 1.3 mm, erodible fraction) in 0-5 cm soil was highest with LOW crop diversity-HIGH input system, and lowest with DAG diversity-RED input system. The opposite was true for large aggregates (> 12.7 mm). Wet aggregate stability was higher for RED input compared to ORG and HIGH input, which was attributed to the increase in the concentration of organic C in aggregates in the RED input system. Amount of light fraction organic matter (LFOM), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and light fraction organic N (LFON) in 0-15 cm soil was higher for RED input compared to ORG and HIGH inputs, and higher for DAG and DAP crop diversities than for LOW crop diversity. Soil N and P were usually deficient under ORG input management, but large amounts of N and P were unaccounted for, or in surplus, under RED and HIGH inputs, despite a marked increase in plant N and P uptake and crop yield compared to ORG input. Overall, our findings suggest that soil quality can be improved and nutrient accumulation in the soil profile can be minimized by increasing cropping frequency, reducing/eliminating tillage, and using appropriate combinations of fertilizer input and diversified cropping.","2009","2015-06-01 20:24:30","2015-06-01 23:14:24","","1-22","","1","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Aggregation; AGRICOLA; Crop diversity; Extractable P; Input level; Nitrate-N; Nutrient balance; Organic C and N; Scopus; search.grain; Soil; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (perennial N1 grain); WOS","biodiversity; carbon; crops; fertilizer application; fertilizers; field experimentation; loam soils; nitrates; nitrogen; nutrient balance; nutrient uptake; phosphorus; prairies; Saskatchewan; soil aggregation; soil organic carbon; soil pH; soil profiles; tillage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the economic merits of nine cropping systems, consisting of a factorial combination of three input management methods and three levels of cropping diversity. It was conducted over the 1996-2007 period on a loam soil at Scott, Saskatchewan. The input treatments were: (1) high input (HIGH), which used conventional tillage and full recommended rates of fertilizers and pesticides 'as required'; (2) reduced input (RED), which used conservation tillage and integrated weed and nutrient management practices in an effort to lower requirements for fuel, fertilizers and pesticides; and (3) organic input (ORG), which used tillage, non-chemical pest control, higher seeding rates, delayed seeding and legume crops to replenish soil nutrients. The crop diversity treatments included: (1) a fallow-based rotation with low crop diversity (LOW); (2) a diversified annual rotation of cereal, oilseed and pulse grains (DAG); and (3) a diversified rotation using annual grains and perennial forages (DAP). All crop rotations were 6 years in length. At the 2007 input costs and prices, average net returns and 12-year net present values were higher for organic than for non-organic treatments, with the ORG input/LOW crop diversity system being the most profitable (net returns = $234 ha(-1) yr(-1) and net present value = $1953 ha(-1)). Net returns averaged about 10% less for ORG/DAG compared to the most profitable system, and about 22% less for HIGH/DAG and RED/DAG (the best non-organic systems). The DAP treatments that included forage were not economically competitive with the other treatments, often producing economic losses. The relative profitability of the organic treatments was highly dependent on the existence of organic price premiums. When price premiums for organic crops were reduced to less than 70% of the 2007 levels, the organic treatments were less profitable than the comparable non-organic treatments. The organic treatments also experienced significantly lower (and often negative) net returns compared to the non-organic treatments during completion of the 3-year organic certification period. We estimated that it required 5-7 years after completion of certification for the organic treatments to break even with the comparable non-organic treatments. Thereafter the organic treatments produced consistently higher net earnings. Production costs averaged 16% lower with ORG management compared to the HIGH-input treatments, but we found little difference in total costs between the respective HIGH-and RED-input treatments. The organic treatments also displayed lower income variability than the non-organic treatments, with the ORG/LOW system being preferred by risk-averse producers, who do not subscribe to all-risk crop insurance, and with the ORG/LOW and ORG/DAG systems preferred by low and medium risk-averse producers when having the added financial protection from the Canada/Saskatchewan all-risk crop insurance program.","2011","2015-06-01 20:24:16","2015-06-01 23:15:02","","208-223","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","WOS:000294120900005","","","","Conservation tillage; crop rotations; net returns; Organic farming; production costs; reduced input management; risk; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study compared non-renewable energy inputs, energy output, and energy use efficiency of nine dryland cropping systems comprised of a factorial combination of three methods of input management [high (HIGH), i.e., conventional tillage plus full recommended rates of fertilizer and pesticides; reduced (RED), i.e., conservation tillage plus reduced rates of fertilizer and pesticides; and organic (ORG), i.e., conventional tillage plus N-fixing legumes and non-chemical means of weed and pest control]; and three crop rotation systems with varying levels of cropping diversity [a fallow-based rotation with low crop diversity (LOW); a diversified rotation using annual cereal, oilseed and pulse grains (DAG): and a diversified rotation using annual grains and perennial forages (DAP)]. The study was conducted over the 1996-2007 period on a Dark Brown Chernozemic soil (Typic Boroll) in the Canadian Prairies. As expected, total direct plus indirect energy input was the highest for the HIGH and RED input treatments (3773 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)), and 50% less for ORG management. Most of the energy savings came from the non-use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides in the ORG management treatments. Further, total energy use was the highest for the DAG treatments (3572 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)), and similar but about 18% lower for the DAP and LOW crop diversity treatments compared to DAG. Thus, overall, the HIGH/DAG and RED/DAG systems had the highest energy requirements (4409 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)) and ORG/DAP had the lowest (1806 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)). Energy output (calorimetric energy content) was typically the highest for the HIGH input treatments (26,541 MJ ha-1 year-'), was about 4% less with RED, and 37% less with ORG management. The latter reflected the lower crop yields obtained with organic management. Similarly, energy output was the highest for the DAP treatments (25,008 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)), about 5% less for DAG, and 20% less for the LOW crop diversity treatments. The higher energy output with the DAP treatments largely reflected that the entire harvested biomass of the forage crops was included in energy output, while for grain crops only the seed was included. The straw and crop residues from annual crops were returned to the land to protect the soil from erosion and to maintain soil organic matter as this is the recommended practice in this semi-arid region. In contrast to energy output and to net energy produced, energy use efficiency (measured as yield of grain plus forage produced per unit of energy input or as energy output/energy input ratio) was the highest for the ORG input treatments (497 kg of harvested production GJ(-1) of energy input, and an energy output/energy input ratio of 83). We obtained lower, but generally similar energy use efficiency for the HIGH and RED input treatments (392 kg GJ(-1) and ratio of 7.1). Thus, overall, ORG/DAP was the most energy efficient cropping system, while RED/LOW and RED/DAG generally ranked the lowest in energy use efficiency. Our findings support the current movement of producers toward ORG management as a means of reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy inputs and improving overall energy use efficiency of their cropping systems. Our results also suggestthat moving away from traditional monoculture cereal rotations that employ frequent summer fallowing, toward extended and diversified crop rotations that use reduced tillage methods, although resulting in an increase in energy output, will not significantly reduce the overall reliance on non-renewable energy inputs, nor enhance energy use efficiency, unless perennial legume forages and/or legume grain crops are included in the cropping mix.","2011","2015-06-01 20:24:18","2015-06-01 23:16:55","","113-123","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Annual grains; Cropping systems; Energy inputs; Energy output; Energy use efficiency; Forage crops; perennial W/1 grain; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (perennial N1 grain); WOS","agrochemicals; agroecosystems; application rate; conservation tillage; conventional tillage; crop management; cropping systems; crop residues; crop rotation; crop yield; dryland farming; energy balance; energy content; energy efficiency; energy requirements; energy use and consumption; fallow; farm inputs; fertilizer rates; forage crops; forage legumes; grain crops; grains; grain yield; land management; legumes; mineral fertilizers; nonrenewable resources; organic production; pesticides; prairies; profitability; reduced tillage; Saskatchewan; seeds; semiarid zones; soil; soil erosion; soil organic matter; soil quality; species diversity; straw; summer; sustainable agriculture; water resources; weed control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trampling led to destruction of a large portion of the aerial system, stolons and roots, with removal of some of the vegetation cover (soil at least 50% bare). From a general view, trampling in experimental plots induced a large decrease (from 70 to 86%) of earthworm density and biomass. The functional structure was modified for the benefit of large size species. Small size species were more sensitive: some species, such as Lumbricus castaneus and Allolobophora chlorotica chlorotica typica disappeared. An increase of the proportion of adults could be related to larger sensitiveness of juvenile individuals in the same population and explained a significant increase of the individual mean weight.

F.","Effects of land use and season on runoff and soil loss","Bull N Carolina Agric Expt Sta","","","","","Field expts. to determine the effectiveness of different land use practices and the effectiveness of various kinds and amts. of applied organic matter have been con-ducted at the Statesville, N. Carolina, Soil Conservation Expt. Station. The plot studies were made on 1/100 acre plots laid out on a 10% slope of Cecil sandy clay loam. Run-off was measured and sampled after each rain causing runoff to determine soil and water losses for the various treatments. Pine and hardwood litter applied as an undisturbed mulch gave almost complete control of runoff and soil loss. Stable manure, compost and woods litter, when applied annually to continuous cotton plots and spaded under, reduced runoff and soil loss to < 1/2 that where no organic matter was applied. These applied materials likewise caused a sharp increase in cotton yield. Without the use of commercial fertilizer, the yield of seed cotton increased from 390 lb. an acre on the check plot to 1,600 lb. per acre and above where the organic matter was applied. The lower rates of application of organic material proved more efficient per ton applied than the higher rates, indicating that even a few tons per acre will be very beneficial. These results indicate that farmers can well afford to conserve and utilize all such organic material available on the farm, much of which is raked and burned. It should prove especially beneficial to thin, eroded areas and to most any soil low in humus content. Both forest cover and permanent sod gave almost complete control of runoff and erosion. These, or other perennial vegetation, should be used on steep or erodible land which cannot be cultivated safely. The use of wheat and lespedeza in a 4-yr. rotation with cotton and corn reduced soil loss to an annual av. for the rotation of 14.4 tons per acre as compared with 31.2 tons per acre from continuous cotton and 66.2 tons per acre from bare land. The sod crop provides excellent protection while growing on the land, and, as crop residues, reduce soil loss from the succeeding row crop. Well established winter cover crops not only furnish protection during the winter but result in a decided decrease in soil loss from the row crop which may follow. Results indicate that the protection afforded by winter cover crops after they are turned is of more importance than the winter protection. Along with this reduction in soil loss, turning under the rye-vetch cover crop resulted in a satisfactory yield of corn, even on desurfaced soil. It is recommended, therefore, that a sod crop be in-cluded at least once every 3-4 yrs. in the rotation and that, if practicable, only one row crop be used. Whenever it it necessary for row crops to follow 2 or more yrs. in succession, winter cover crops should be used to be turned under. The soil conserving effects of a well established sod containing perennial grasses and legumes continued even through the 2d yr. when it was turned and followed by 2 row crops. Soil loss was very low from the 1st row crop and moderate from the 2d row crop. An annual lespedeza sod reduced soil loss from the first row crop which followed, though, to a lesser extent than the permanent sod, but there was no material reduction from the 2d row crop. Frequent burnings of the forest plot over a period of 7 yrs. increased runoff > 100-fold or more than that lost from either cotton or corn in a 4-yr. rotation. The soil loss increased from practically none to nearly 8 tons per acre. Duration of runoff from the protected forested watershed was always greater than that from the cultivated watershed. This delay in runoff is vitally important in cutting down peak flows during flood stages of streams. The benefits of woodlot protection are varied and many: More and higher growth timber; a greater wildlife population; a constant water supply for wells, springs, and streams; and an ever building up of the organic content of the top soil. The 3 summer mos. of June, July and Aug. accounted for 75-90% of the annual soil loss both from the 4-yr. rotation and from continuous cotton where organic materials were applied. This was found, by an analysis of the rainfall and soil loss data, to be due to the high intensities of the summer rains. Arranging all rains causing runoff into amt. and intensity groupings showed that serious soil losses were not necessarily caused by big rains, but rather by hard rains. It is clearly evident that this summer season constitutes the most critical period of the yr. and is the time when protective measures are most needed, particularly on cultivated land. Crop residues, contour tillage and terracing should be utilized as conservation practices. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ","1944","2015-06-01 17:56:10","2015-06-01 17:56:10","","1-28","","","347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19462000009638","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ratooning rice yield is directly related to the rate of ratooning bud germinating into spikes, and thereby enhancing ratooning bud germination is a key element for ratooning rice high yield. Numerous studies on rice eco-physiology have shown that nitrogen application enhances bud development also strongly promotes ratooning bud germination. However, the molecular mechanism of nitrogen application for bud development to promote ratooning bud germination has remained unclear. This paper studied the effects of nitrogen application for bud development on protein expression of ratooning buds of rice and the corresponding physiological characteristics by using comparative proteomics and relative physiological indicators. A total of 20 differentially expressed proteins were detected in different treatments in 2-DE maps of ratooning bud proteome. The proteins involved in energy metabolism, growth regulation, defense response to stress, etc. The results indicated that the expression abundance of nucleoside diphosphate kinase protein involved in energy metabolism was down-regulated and the proteins involved in photosynthesis (probable photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex protein and cytochrome b6-f complex iron-sulfur subunit) were up-regulated during ratooning bud germination. Furthermore, protein expressions were higher under nitrogen application treatment than non-fertilization treatment on 7 d and 14 d after nitrogen application for bud development. It suggested that nitrogen application for ratooning bud development significantly slowed the down-regulation of proteins involved in energy metabolism, and promoted the up-regulation of proteins involved in photosynthesis. Thus ratooning buds mediated by fertilization treatment had relatively stronger energy synthesis and photoautotroph capabilities, which better met the needs of energy and material for ratooning bud germination and differentiation. Six protein spots involved in cellular growth and five protein spots involved in resistance were detected and identified in the study. Among them, two protein spots (translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog and actin-depolymerizing factor) were down-regulated and nine protein spots (e.g., germin-like protein, ABA/WDS-induced protein, putative quinone-oxidoreductase QR2, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and dirigent-like protein) were up-regulated during the ratooning bud germination. Furthermore, expression abundance of proteins (e.g., ABA/WDS-induced protein and actin-depolymerizing factor on the 7th and 14th day, germin-like protein on the 7th day of fertilization) was lower under nitrogen application treatment than non-fertilization treatment. Proteins (e.g., translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog, putative quinone-oxidoreductase QR2, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and dirigent-like protein on the 7th and 14th day, germin-like protein on the 14th day) had higher expressions under fertilization treatment than non-fertilization treatment. It indicated that nitrogen application for ratooning bud development relatively cut down the expression abundance of proteins that inhibited ratooning bud germination. Meanwhile, it increased the expression abundance of proteins related to cell division, elongation and resistance, which promoted the germination of ratooning bud and enhanced the ability to resist adverse conditions. Therefore compared with those under non-fertilization treatment, living bud rate and length of the 2nd to the 5th ratooning bud were significantly higher in nitrogen application treatment. As a result, nitrogen application for bud development significantly improved effective panicle number, seed setting rate and grain yield of ratooning rice, which was aimed at getting high yield and significant improvement in ratooning rice production.","2014","2015-06-01 18:20:48","2015-06-01 18:20:48","","1405-1413","","12","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20153025244","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Absolute yield loss increased with nitrogen rates in 2001 and 2002 in the Louisiana experiment; however, percentage of yield loss was not affected. This finding suggests that nitrogen rate does not affect tolerance of rice to L. oryzophilus injury. In the Texas experiment, differences were detected for ratoon crop yield among nitrogen rates and insecticide that were applied at preflood on the main crop, indicating a carryover of fertilizer and insecticide effects from the main to the ratoon crop.

The total amount of N accumulated in the stubble was closely related to nitrogen application for promoting bud and tiller, the relationship exhibited a parabola curve. The nitrogen source in the stubble of the main season was gradually transported to the tillers of ratoon crop after the main crop was harvested. It played a great role in bud sprouting and tiller growing. N accumulation in the leaves and stem-sheath of ratoon rice increased with the increase of nitrogen application, and a large amount of N in the parts of ratoon rice were transported to the panicles after full heading. The apparent transportation rate was 57-76% of N translocation from the stubble of the main crop.

At all drought stress potentials, the osmopriming increased the perennial rye seed germination rate and percentage, root and shoot length. At high drought stress potential (-12 MPa) the primed seeds with -15 MPa had the greatest germination rate and percentage. Also at low drought stress potential (-4 MPa) the greatest root and shoot length was observed when the seeds were primed with -15 MPa. The root and shoot length of the primed seeds with -11, -13 and -15 MPa were not significantly different at high drought stress potential (-12 MPa).

The effects of small-grain species, mulch species, and top-dress N on grain and mulch yield and the grain N concentration of winter cereals direct-drilled into legume living mulches were examined in a two-year field study in New York, U.S.A., on soils of the Lima and Kendaia series: fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Glossoboric and Aeric Hapludalfs. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or rye (Secale cereale L.) were grown in monoculture or drilled into summer-established plots of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.), ladino clover (Trifolium repens L. forma lodigense Hort ex. Gams), red clover (T. pratense L.), or white clover (T. repens L.). Spring top-dress N was applied at 0 or 56 kg N ha−1. Cereals were reseeded for a second season. Mulches generally interfered more and yielded more with wheat than with rye. Birdsfoot trefoil, crownvetch, and white clover had little effect on grain-yield the first year; birdsfoot trefoil and crownvetch interfered strongly with cereals the second year. Red clover did not affect rye grain-yield in the absence of top-dress N, but did tend to reduce wheat yield. Top-dress N increased cereal grain-yield and decreased mulch yield. In general, legume mulches did not appear to enhance cereal N nutrition the first year; red and white clovers appeared to contribute N to rye the second year. Second-year grain-yields were generally lower than first-year yields, due to increased interference from living mulches and broadleaf weeds. All living mulches except crownvetch suppressed weeds the second year. The results indicate that some species of perennial forage legumes may be suitable for use as living mulches for direct-drilled small grains, especially tall early winter cereals.","December 1991","2015-06-01 19:22:15","2015-06-01 19:22:15","","135-148","","1–2","28","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biodynamic soils had not had organic or inorganic fertilisers applied for, on average, 17 years, while the conventional soils had received regular inputs of fertilisers containing soluble phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). The experiment examined whether the contrasting fertiliser histories had resulted in different pathways of plant nutrient uptake through assessing the response of white clover (Trifolium repens L.), perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne L.) and the indigenous vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi to addition of four levels of soluble P and N. The response to added P and N did not differ between the conventional and biodynamic soils, although, plants in the biodynamic soils had a slower growth rate and a higher level of colonisation by VAM fungi due to lower initial soil P and N concentrations. Overall, there was no indication that the biodynamic and conventional soils had developed substantially different processes to enhance plant nutrient uptake or that the indigenous VAM fungi differed in their tolerance to applications of soluble nutrients.","March 22, 1999","2015-06-01 19:33:13","2015-06-01 23:18:17","","51-62","","1","73","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Clover; N; P; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); Rye grass; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass""); Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","application rate; bioassays; biochemical pathways; Lolium perenne; mycorrhizal fungi; nitrogen fertilizers; nutrient uptake; organic production; pastures; phosphorus fertilizers; roots; shoots; soil biology; Trifolium repens; vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this work were to (i) determine whether tiller emergence under low phosphorus availability is a function of the availability of assimilates for growth or a direct result of low P availability, (ii) attempt to establish a quantitative relation between an index of the availability of P in the plant and the effects of P deficiency on tiller emergence, and (iii) to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tiller emergence in field-grown wheat. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. INTA Oasis), was grown in the field under drip irrigation on a typic Argiudol, low in P (5.5 mu g P g(-1) soil Bray & Kurtz I) in Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments consisted of the combination of three levels of P fertilization 0, 60 and 200 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and two levels of assimilate availability, a control (non-shaded) and 65% of reduction in incident irradiance from seedling emergence until the end of tillering (shaded). Phosphorus treatments significantly modified the pattern of growth and development of the plants. Shading reduced the growth and concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates in leaves and stems. Leaf photosynthetic rate at saturating irradiance was reduced by P deficiency, but was not affected by shading. At shoot P concentrations less than 4.2 g P kg(-1) the heterogeneity in the plant population increased with respect to the number of plants bearing a certain tiller. At a shoot P concentration of 1.7 g P kg(-1) tillering ceased completely. Phosphorus deficiency directly altered the normal pattern of tiller emergence by slowing the emergence of leaves on the main stem (i.e. increasing the phyllochron), and by reducing the maximum rate of tiller emergence for each tiller.","1999","2015-06-01 17:47:54","2015-06-01 17:47:54","","283-295","","2","209","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000081309200015","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plots were shaded at 4 different stages during the tuber formation period to control dry matter production and tuber production by suppressing the radiation absorbed by the weed. After the shades were removed, the stem surface area (i.e., the assimilatory organ of the weed) did not increase during the rest of the tuber formation period. The radiation absorbed by the weed was markedly suppressed when shading was conducted in the early tuber formation period (the first 15 days after the tuber initial stage). Tuber production was closely related to absorbed radiation throughout the entire tuber formation period. The shortage of assimilated carbohydrates during the early tuber formation period reduced final tuber weight of the weed. These results suggests that a shortage of assimilated carbohydrates during the early tuber formation period defines potential tuber growth and determines final tuber weight. Shading in the early tuber formation period minimized tuber production and that the shortage of assimilated carbohydrates during the early tuber formation period was an effective control technique for suppressing the tuber reproduction of the perennial weed.","2001","2015-06-01 17:27:27","2015-06-01 17:27:27","","273-281","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20023037936","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Expt 1, where sodium fertilizer was applied to productive pastures consisting mainly of the natrophile perennial rye-grass, the herbage sodium content and the milk yield of cows was increased and milk somatic cell count (SCC) reduced. In Expt 2, which used pastures containing less productive, natrophobic grasses and broad-leaved plants in Estonia, sodium fertilizer did not increase herbage sodium content and did not affect milk production or composition. In Expt 3 the sodium content of the diet of individually tethered cows was increased from 1 to either 6 or 11 g/kg dry matter (DM) by adding salt to their restricted feed allowance, and the cows' milk yield was increased by the high level of sodium supplement and milk SCC were reduced by both levels of sodium supplement. The calcium and magnesium status of cows was improved by the sodium supplement. In Expt 4 a low level of supplementary salt was included in the ration of tethered cows to increase the sodium content of the diet from 2 to 3.6 g/kg DM. No effects on milk yield or SCC were found, but the sodium supplement reduced Staphylococcus aureus contamination of the milk, but not the proportion of milk samples infected with Escherichia coli. It was concluded that the optimum dietary sodium concentration for maximum milk yield was greater than the published requirements, and that substantial increases in sodium intake above current requirements also reduced milk SCC.","2000","2015-06-01 20:30:32","2015-06-01 20:30:32","","1-12","","1","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to yield of ratooning rice with different stubble heights of the main crop, the eight varieties were classified into three ratooning types, Such as high-stubble type (HST), low-stubble type (LST) and high/medium-stubble type (HMST). Decline of the stubble height resulted in decreased number of effective panicles and increased grain number per panicle in ratooning rice, especially for the grain number per panicle in ratooning rice of LST varieties. The leaf area index in ratooning rice of FIST and HMST varieties was the highest under the high stubble treatment (40 cm), whereas that in ratooning rice of LST varieties increased with the decline of the stubble height. The leaf photosynthetic rates from full heading to 20 days after full heading in ratooning rice of HST varieties were higher under the medium (20 cm) or high (40 cm) stubble treatments, whereas the leaf photosynthetic rates at the full heading stage in ratooning rice of HMST and LST varieties were higher under the high stubble treatment and those at 10 days and 20 days after full heading were higher under the medium (20 cm) or low (10 cm) stubble treatments. The crop growth rates of ratooning rice of HST varieties were the highest under the high stubble treatment. whereas those of HMST and LST varieties were the highest under the low or medium stubble treatments. The activity of catalase in rachis branches of ratooning rice of HMST and LST varieties improved with declining stubble height, whereas a contrary trend was observed for HST ones. The transport rates of carbohydrate in stems and sheathes of ratooning rice of HST varieties were higher under the high stubble treatment, and those of LST ones were higher under the low and medium Stubble treatments.

Air and soil temperatures are microclimatic factors which control sugarcane emergence and growth and may be significantly affected by harvest method. A series of studies were conducted in Florida and Costa Rica during 2005–2011, on three soil types to determine the effects of harvest method on microclimate. Green cane harvest produced 11.4–17.3 t/ha (average for three cropping years) of crop residues across locations. At 2-cm soil depth, increases in soil temperature during burning were 2.1–2.5 °C in muck soil, 4.6–5.8 °C in clay soil, and 6.0–7.5 °C in sandy soil. At 10-cm depth, soil temperatures during burning increased by &lt;0.5 °C in muck soil, 0.7–0.9 °C in clay soil, and 1.9–2.2 °C in sandy soil. During cold nights when air temperatures were near or below freezing, minimum air temperatures near the soil surface were lower for green cane compared to burnt cane harvest methods. The average temperature difference across these near-freeze events was 1.38 °C (1.20 °C for muck and 1.56 °C for sand). There was greater variation in the diurnal range of soil temperature following burnt cane harvest at each location. Soil temperature differences were greater at early growth stages (April) than late growth stages (August). Across soil types, reductions in soil temperature following green cane harvest were greater in sand and clay followed by muck soil. Our results indicate that young shoots emerged from green cane harvested fields may suffer frost damage and delayed growth when air temperatures are near or below freezing. In addition, transient increases in soil temperatures following burning were smaller than normal seasonal variations in soil temperature, suggesting that burning has minimal impact on soil microflora and fauna within the 2- to 10-cm soil profile range.","August 15, 2013","2015-06-01 19:39:10","2015-06-01 19:39:10","","101-109","","0","177","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Air temperature; Burnt cane harvest; Green cane harvest; Harvest residue; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil temperature; SPV; Trash","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the relationship between the decreased index of SPAD value of leaf from full heading to harvesting (DISVLFHH) and ratooning ability, the plant characters of main crop for high yielding combinations of main crop and ratooning rice were studied, which could provide a theoretical and practical basis for improvement of high yield breeding and cultivation of hybrid rice. Method: The experiment was conducted with eighteen mid-season rice combinations grown in a traditional high yield cultivation system, in a randomized block design with 3 replications. The results were analyzed through variance, correlation, regression and path analysis. Result: Alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles and grain yield of ratooning rice were the key traits of ratooning ability, which was a an important approach for further high yield of ratooning rice by increasing effective panicles. There were significant or highly significant relationships between spikelets per panicle, the ratio of leaf area to spikelets, the ratio of leaf area to grains, the ratio of leaf area to grain weight, decreased LAI index, DISVLFHH of main crop and alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles, grain yield of ratooning rice, and the partial correlation coefficient between only DISVLFHH among all trais and alive bud rate, born bud rate, effective panicles, grain yield of ratooning rice got significant at 0.05 level. As for one variety, it's impossible that both main crop and ratooning rice could get top grain yield. The high-yielding combinations for 11.5 t per ha of the theory grain yield and 14 t per ha of potential grain yield for main crop and ratooning rice would have the following source-sink characteristics: 160-190 spikelets per panicle, the ratio of leaf area to grain weight 0.0737-0.0827 cm 2 per mg, DISVLFHH 0.4029-0.5409, effective panicles 232.12*10 4-249.40*10 4 per ha, seed setting percentage 81.54%-85.74%, 1000-grain weight 28.58-30.07 g, grain weight 4.13-4.43 g per panicle. Conclusion: Increasing effective panicles is an important approach for further high yield of ratooning rice, DISVLFHH of main crop can be used as a new evaluation index for ratooning ability, and the combinations with middle-big spikelets per panicle are the key characteristic for selection of mid-season rice hybrids for high yield of main crop and ratooning rice.","2009","2015-06-01 18:23:08","2015-06-01 18:23:08","","3442-3450","","10","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093330350","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the effect of the exotic macrophyte, para grass (Urochloa mutica), on benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates of a tropical floodplain in northern Australia. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from four grass communities: (1) para grass, (2) hymenachne (Hymenachne acutigluma), a native perennial; (3) rice (Oryza meridionalis), a native annual, and (4) areas where para grass had been sprayed with herbicide. 2. Macroinvertebrate richness, abundance and community similarity showed very few differences among the grass communities, particularly in the epiphytic habitat. Benthic invertebrates showed some differences among grasses, with lower richness and abundance and different community structure associated with hymenachne. Herbicide control of para grass had no apparent effect on benthic invertebrates but reduced the abundance of epiphytic invertebrates in the short term. 3. The results of this study indicate that para grass has very little impact on macroinvertebrate communities, despite the changes to macrophyte communities. This is probably because para grass has similar physical structure to the native grasses and because none of these grasses contribute directly to aquatic food webs. Control of para grass using herbicide has little impact on aquatic invertebrates. This suggests that predicting the impact of weed invasion in wetlands requires an understanding of both the functional properties of macrophytes and the habitat preferences of the macroinvertebrates.","2003","2015-06-01 20:26:28","2015-06-01 22:24:05","","962-971","","6","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Australia; Invasion; Macroinvertebrate; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Weed; Wetland; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The highest total dry matter yield was 27.1 t ha−1. We examined the effects of two times of first harvest (booting stage versus full heading stage). Plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 50% higher dry matter yield of first crop than those harvested at the booting stage, because the plants had greater weights per tiller than those harvested at the booting stage. Plants harvested at the booting stage produced 37% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those harvested at the full heading stage, because the plants had greater dry weights per tiller than those harvested at the full heading stage. Overall, plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 8% higher total dry matter yield than those harvested at the booting stage. We also examined the effects of two total amounts of nitrogen (300 kg N ha−1 versus 150 kg N ha−1) and three nitrogen application methods (method 1: 33.3% applied at transplanting, 66.7% at the maximum tiller number stage, 0.0% at 7 days after the first harvest, and 0.0% at 21 days after the first harvest; method 2: 33.3, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively; method 3: 33.3, 0.0, 33.3%, and 33.3%, respectively). For the first crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha−1 produced 10% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha−1 in 2004. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 produced 21% and 23% higher dry matter yield of first crop than plants that underwent method 3, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha−1 treatment and in nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of first crop in these treatments. For the second crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha−1 produced 10% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those that received 150 kg N ha−1. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 produced 57% and 56% higher dry matter yield of second crop than method 1, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha−1 treatment and in nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of second crop in these treatments.

Taporuri produced the highest total dry matter yield, with a value 60% higher than that of Hinohikari. The first crop of Taporuri had a longer duration of vegetative growth than those of Mohretsu and Hinohikari, and had the highest dry matter yield because of its greater weight per tiller than Hinohikari and its more tillers per square meter than Saikaishi 253, which had a similar duration of vegetative growth. The second crops of Mohretsu, Taporuri, and Saikaishi 253 had longer vegetative growth and higher dry matter yields than Hinohikari. Dry matter yields of both crops were closely related to the duration of vegetative growth and the weight per tiller, but not to tillers per square meter. These results suggest that cultivars with a long duration of vegetative growth, high weight per tiller, and adequate tillers per square meter can produce high dry matter yield in both crops. There was a significant interaction (P &lt; 0.05) in total dry matter yield between cultivar or line and cultivation type. The total dry matter yield of Taporuri in twice harvesting was about 10% higher than that in once harvesting, whereas that of Hinohikari was about 10% lower. The suitability for twice harvesting ([total dry matter yield in twice harvesting]/[total dry matter yield in once harvesting]) was significantly positively correlated (r = 0.875) with the increase in dry weight before the full heading stage, but significantly negatively correlated (r = −0.903) with the increase in dry weight between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. Thus, cultivars with a high increase in dry weight before full heading appear to be more suitable for twice harvesting than those with a high increase between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. In addition, our study showed that twice harvesting can prevent lodging in Taporuri, thereby increasing the suitability of this cultivar as a forage rice. Our results suggest that twice harvesting can be performed in southwestern Japan and warmer regions.","March 15, 2007","2015-06-01 19:37:52","2015-06-01 22:08:57","","269-275","","3","101","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dry matter yield; Forage rice; Oryza sativa L.; Ratoon cropping; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); Twice harvesting; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the late yellow ripening stage, the plant length of basal ratoons, ratoon tiller number, total dry matter weight of ratoon tillers, and root dry matter weight were significantly lower in the treatment with flooding 1 day after harvesting than in the other water managements. The total dry matter weight of ratoon tillers that corresponded to the yield at the second harvest (aftermath) was higher in the treatment with flooding 7 days after harvesting than in the other water treatments. The basal ratoons showed greater plant length and single-tiller weight than the upper nodal ratoons, accounting for over 92% of the total ratoon tiller weight.","2007","2015-06-01 18:23:48","2015-06-01 18:23:48","","109-113","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20073244930","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was no difference in the feed conversion efficiencies of cows if maintenance energy requirements were taken into account. However, cows on restricted allowances (Expt II, Period 2) showed no significant difference in milk yield, indicating that the effect of increased nutritive value was very slight. There were no consistent effects on milk fat, protein or lactose concentrations.

Relative growth rates (RGR) of shoots of L. elongatum and the amphiploid were lower than those of 'Chinese Spring' (34 and 13 % respectively) and main stein development was also slower. There was no difference in shoot RGR of any of the chromosome addition or substitution lines and that of 'Chinese Spring' when assessed between Haun stages 2.0 and 5.0. In contrast, several aspects of plant development were observed to differ in the chromosome addition and substitution lines. Substituting E genome chromosomes (with the exceptions of 3E and 4E) for D genome chromosomes, or adding E genome chromosomes, slowed the rate of main stem development, at least up to Haun stage 5.0. Despite these differences in the rate of main stein development, the appearance of adventitious roots commenced at approximately Haun stage 2.0 in all genotypes. However, the numbers of adventitious roots and tillers at the 5.0 Haun stage differed between some of the lines when compared to 'Chinese Spring'.

Objective: We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of this tablet in children and adolescents with grass pollen-related allergic rhinitis. Methods: In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 278 children (5-17 years of age) with grass pollen-related rhinoconjunctivitis (confirmed by means of a positive grass pollen skin prick test response and serum-specific IgE measurement) received once-daily SLIT tablets or placebo. Treatment was initiated 4 months before the estimated pollen season and continued throughout the season. The primary outcome was the rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score (RTSS), a sum of 6 individual symptom scores: sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, watery eyes, and itchy eyes. Secondary end points included rescue medication intake, individual scores, and safety. Results: The intent-to-treat population included 266 children (mean age, 10.9 ± 3.22 years). The RTSS for the 300-IR group was highly significantly different from that of the placebo group (P = .001). The 300-IR group showed a mean improvement for the RTSS of 28.0% over that seen with placebo and a median improvement of 39.3%. Significant differences between the 300-IR and placebo groups were also observed regarding rescue medication score and proportion of days using rescue medication during the pollen season (P = .0064 and P = .0146, respectively). Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in intensity and expected. No serious side effects were reported. Conclusion: Five-grass-pollen SLIT tablets (300 IR) reduce both symptom scores and rescue medication use in children and adolescents with grass pollen-related rhinoconjunctivitis.","2009","2015-06-01 20:29:16","2015-06-02 02:03:44","","160-166.e3","","1","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","adolescents; Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis; children; grass pollen allergy; optimal dose; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; sublingual immunotherapy; sublingual tablet; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At Kabete, endosulfan, dimethoate, pirimiphos-methyl, fluvalinate, Bacillus thuringiensis and neem extract were evaluated on short-duration genotype ICPL 87091. At Kiboko, endosulfan, dimethoate, pirimiphos-methyl, B. thuringiensis and deltamethrin were evaluated on short-duration ICPL 87091, medium-duration ICP 6927 and long-duration ICEAP 00020. The major insect pests on pigeon pea were pod borers ( Helicoverpa armigera, Maruca vitrata, Etiella zinckenella and Lampides boeticus at Kiboko, and H. armigera, E. zinckenella and L. boeticus at Kabete), pod-sucking bugs ( Clavigralla tomentosicollis) and pod fly ( Melanagromyza chalcosoma). The results indicated that all sprays improved grain yields and seed quality at Kabete, with 57-152% grain yield gains with different insecticides. Endosulfan performed better among the high volume sprayed insecticides at Kabete. Pod fly damage was less in plots treated with dimethoate and endosulfan. Results from Kiboko showed that ultra-low-volume (ULV) spraying was more efficient than high volume sprayed insecticides. Endosulfan was also good among the high volume sprays. Spraying the short-duration genotype with ULV resulted in lower pest population than the medium- and long-duration genotypes. Neem extract and B. thuringiensis were not as effective as the synthetic insecticides at both locations.","2000","2015-06-01 17:15:39","2015-06-01 17:15:39","","53-55","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20013005177","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perennial ryegrass plants (L. perenne L.) were labelled in a continuously labelled C-14-CO2 atmosphere to follow carbon flow through the plant and all soil compartments. After 115 days, root biomass was 41% greater at elevated CO2 than at ambient CO2 and this root biomass seemed to be the driving force for the increase of C-14-labelled carbon in all compartments examined, i.e. carbon in the soil solution, soil microbial biomass and soil residue. After incubation for 230 days at 14 degrees C, roots grown at elevated CO2 decomposed slower (14%) than roots grown at ambient CO2. Increasing the incubation temperature of the roots grown at elevated CO2 by 2 degrees C could not compensate for this delay in decomposition. In addition,'elevated CO2' root-derived material (C-14-labelled soil microorganisms plus C-14-labelled soil residue) decomposed significantly slower (29%) than 'ambient CO2' root-derived material. At the end of the incubation experiment, the ratio between C-14-labelled microorganisms and total (CO2)-C-14 evolved showed no difference among root incubation and incubation of root-derived material. Thus, the substrate use efficiency of microorganisms, involved with decomposition of roots and root-derived material, seems not to be affected by an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Therefore, the lower decomposition rate at elevated CO2 is not due to a change in the internal metabolism of microorganisms.","APR  2000","2015-06-01 17:31:17","2015-06-02 02:03:38","","449-456","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000086255300002","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on energy inputs were recorded for crop-production operations through biweekly visits to the selected farms, for human labor, bullocks, electric motors, diesel engines and tractors. Applications of fertilizers and chemicals and the results of yields were recorded. On a per hectare basis, the use of tractors reduces the use of both human labor and bullocks on farms and increases the total energy consumption. Due to timely land preparation, yields of most of the crops were higher on tractor-operated farms than on bullock-operated farms. On rainfed farms, energy consumption was the lowest due to lack of a permanent source of irrigation. Floods destroyed the crops on certain plots, and therefore subsequent operations like harvesting were not performed. Canal-irrigated farms had higher cropping intensities and used more energy than rainfed farms. Per hectare consumption of energy was highest on tubewell-irrigated farms due to the high consumption of electrical or diesel energy for pumping.","January 1996","2015-06-01 19:40:00","2015-06-01 19:40:00","","45-53","","1","21","","Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is recalcitrant for in vitro manipulation. In this study, various parameters affecting Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated infection were tested to optimize transformation efficiency in perennial ryegrass. The effects of heat shock and maltose concentration during Agrobacterium infection were evaluated along with variations in callus induction medium, bacterial infection media and callus age. Our results suggest that Agrobacterium infection at 42 A degrees C for 3 min and co-cultivation of Agrobacterium-infected callus on a high maltose medium (6 %) significantly enhances the transformation efficiency in perennial ryegrass. The most optimal conditions proved to be use of four-month-old embryogenic callus induced on a modified N6 medium, infected with Agrobacterium grown on a modified Murashige and Skoog (MSM) medium, and a 42 A degrees C heat shock treatment followed by the co-cultivation of the Agrobacterium and the callus on medium containing 6 % maltose (instead of 3 %). Using this optimized protocol, we were able to increase the transformation efficiencies for regenerated plants from approximately 1 % to over 20 %. Significant improvement in rice stable transformation efficiency was also observed when the optimized conditions were applied to this important cereal, indicating the method described here may apply to other monocots as well.","JUL  2013","2015-06-01 17:26:05","2015-06-01 22:13:02","","19-29","","1","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000320562300003","","","","Heat shock; Maltose; Perennial ryegrass; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Transformation; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, ensiling was tested as a biological pretreatment method of the high yielding grass variety Festulolium Hykor. The biomass was harvested in four cuts over a growing season. Three important factors of ensiling: biomass composition, dry matter (DM) at ensiling, and inoculation of lactic acid bacteria, were assessed in relation to subsequent enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis. The organic acid profile after ensiling was dependant on the composition of the grass and the DM, rather than on the inocula. High levels of organic acids, notably lactic acid, produced during ensiling improved enzymatic cellulose convertibility in the grass biomass. Ensiling of less mature grass gave higher convertibility. Low DM at ensiling (<25%) resulted in the highest cellulose convertibilities, which ranged from 32 to 70% of the available cellulose in the four cuts after ensiling. The study confirms that ensiling can enhance cellulose convertibility of green biomass, and provides new insight to ensiling as a biological pretreatment method for green biomass conversion.","NOV  2013","2015-06-01 17:29:29","2015-06-02 02:03:31","","303-312","","","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000330490600032","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regional and local environmental changes governed the character of the site and the duration of human activity. After an episode of marine conditions, natural hydrological succession and terrestrialisation of the site preceded fire clearance of marsh fen-carr alder scrub that prepared the ground for cultivation and then maintained a reedswamp-type wet grassland in which rice was grown. Cropping of Typha stands may have formed part of the subsistence base before the site was overwhelmed by marine inundation ca 7200 cal BP, after which rice cultivation spread to Neolithic sites of Hemudu type elsewhere in the coastal lowlands.

In central Taiwan, two generations of the vector small brown planthopper (SBPH) (Laodelphax striatellus) could occur on ratoon rice or wheats during winter. Both the infected plants and the viruliferous SBPH which survived the winter could become the source of rice stripe virus (RSV) in the next year. In the paddy field, SBPH could be detected throughout the year and its population reached a peak in early June and in October on the 1st and 2nd rice crops, respectively. During the period of 1984-1987, a total of 13,546 SBPH were collected in 138 surveys (2 surveys per month) from Da-Tsuen, Changhwa Hsien and Pai-twen, Taichung city. Active transmitters of RSV, as determined by bioassay, were found to account for 6.7% of the collected population. The active transmitters reached a peak during early May to late June in the 1st crop and during late September and early October in the 2nd crop. Analysis of data on disease incidence indicates two main infection periods for RSV in the 1st rice crop. The 1st infection period was from seedling stage to 20 days after transplanting, and the major source of infection was the overwintering insect individuals which were responsible for 1 to 19% of the total RSV infections in the 1st crop. The second infection period occurred about 40 to 60 days after transplanting, and the major infection source was the 1st generation of SBPH multiplied in the paddy field. Over 80% of the total RSV infections in the 1st crop could be attributable to this source. A regression equation: Y = 12.46X - 0.143, where Y is estimation of percent incidence of RSV in the paddy field, and X is the product of natural population and active transmitters of SBPH in March to April, was found suitable for forecasting the infection rate in the first rice crop.","1989","2015-06-01 18:32:58","2015-06-01 18:32:58","","290-303","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199089108760","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo/in situ methods for the estimation of microbial efficiencies were compared with an in vitro method based on a modification of an in vitro gas test. Perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) was harvested at four stages of maturity during primary spring growth and ensiled after a short period of wilting. Silages deficient in crude protein (CP) were balanced to 13 % CP in the dry matter of the diet with soya-bean meal. All silages were supplemented with a barley-based pre-mix (0.49 kg per day) and fed to four Angler Rotvieh steers in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Organic matter intake (OMI) was restricted to about 85 % of the voluntary feed intake and in vivo organic matter digestibilities were calculated from faecal marker concentration of titanium(IV)-oxide during a 14 day collection period. Estimates of the effectively degradable organic matter intake (EDOMI) were obtained from in situ incubations. In vivo microbial efficiencies were calculated on the basis of measurements of renal exogenous allantoin excretions and related to digestible OMI and EDOMI. Silages and mixed diets were incubated in vitro in buffered rumen fluid to determine true OM degradation and gas production. In vitro microbial efficiencies were estimated from the partitioning factor, i.e. the ratio of organic matter degraded after 24 h of incubation to gas volume produced by it. As a general observation, the different methods gave similar rankings of silages and diets with respect to OM digestion and microbial biomass yield. The silages from advanced stages of maturity were ruminally less degradable and digestible in vivo, in situ and in vitro. However, ranking by in vitro gas production alone, gave different results. In addition to being of lower degradability/digestibility, silages from advanced stages of maturity were also less efficient, i.e. less of the degraded substrate was converted into microbial biomass. In vivo/in situ and in vitro estimates of microbial efficiencies ranked the silages similar.","1999","2015-06-01 20:30:42","2015-06-01 20:30:42","","57-67","","2","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rhizomes are the primary morphological feature facilitating overwintering in Sorghum species; however, underlying physiological mechanisms governing rhizome overwintering remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the composition of sorghum rhizomes from diverse germplasm before and after overwintering at two locations and three experimental environments. Significant positive correlations were found between rhizome overwintering and water-soluble carbohydrates, ethanol soluble carbohydrates, and fructan concentrations, while significant negative correlations were found between rhizome overwintering and both crude fat and starch. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calibration equations were developed to quickly and efficiently predict the concentrations of each of these assimilates in rhizomes.","June 2013","2015-06-01 19:52:34","2015-06-01 23:29:30","","822-829","","2","6","","BioEnergy research","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS; Perennial; Rhizome composition; Scopus; search.sorghum; sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","biomass; energy; energy crops; equations; ethanol; feedstocks; germplasm; near-infrared spectroscopy; overwintering; rhizomes; soil erosion; soil organic carbon; starch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perennial crops could also provide economically viable cropping option to farmers.

The objective of this research was to evaluate interspecific hybrids between perennial Helianthus tuberosus L. (2n = 6x = 102) and annual H. annuus L. (2n = 2x = 34) for perenniality and agronomic traits; assessing their utility in developing a perennial seed crop. Field trials indicated that seed yield traits were positively correlated with head traits. Tuber traits, which are required for perenniality, and seed yield traits were not correlated, indicating that simultaneous selection may be able to target high yielding lines that also tuberize. The F1 individuals were intermated for one generation and the intermated F1 (IM1F1) showed increases in head size (up to 20%) compared to the best F1 individual. The lack of correlation between tuber and seed traits coupled with phenotypic improvement after one generation of intermating suggest that the best improvement strategy for perennial sunflower is a recurrent selection program focusing on yield.","January 2014","2015-06-01 19:18:22","2015-06-01 22:00:05","","254-264","","0","155","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem services; Flow cytometry; Helianthus; Interspecific hybridization; Perennial grain; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Phenotypic correlation; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A SPOT 5 image acquired in May 2006 with four spectral bands (green, red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared) and 10-m pixel size covering intensively cropped areas in south Texas was evaluated for crop identification. Two images with pixel sizes of 20 m and 30 m were also generated from the original image to simulate coarser resolution satellite imagery. Two subset images covering a variety of crops with different growth stages were extracted from the satellite image and five supervised classification techniques, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to the 10-m subset images and the two coarser resolution images to identify crop types. The effects of the short-wave infrared band and pixel size on classification results were also examined. Kappa analysis showed that maximum likelihood and SVM performed better than the other three classifiers, though there were no statistical differences between the two best classifiers. Accuracy assessment showed that the 10-m, four-band images based on maximum likelihood resulted in the best overall accuracy values of 91% and 87% for the two respective sites. The inclusion of the short-wave infrared band statistically significantly increased the overall accuracy from 82% to 91% for site 1 and from 75% to 87% for site 2. The increase in pixel size from 10 m to 20 m or 30 m did not significantly affect the classification accuracy for crop identification.

Irrigation in the district started in 1936 when the watertable depth was about 9 m. Over the past 30 years, the watertable has risen as a consequence of irrigation, wet winters and inadequate drainage. In addition, the Wakool Irrigation District is underlain by the Calivil and Renmark aquifers of the Murray Basin. Rising groundwater pressures in these deeper aquifers are also contributing to the rising shallow watertable. Since 1981, a sub-surface drainage scheme with 48 bores pumping shallow saline groundwater into a 2000 ha evaporation basin has been developed in two stages to control the watertable in the Wakool Irrigation District. This paper describes the development and application of an integrated hydrogeological model for the Wakool Irrigation District, where management of rising watertable levels and land salinisation is a continuing problem. The model development is considered to be an important part in the establishment of sustainable water management policies for the Wakool Irrigation District. The Wakool model was developed by using the MIKE SHE integrated catchment-modelling package. The developed model enables analysis of the complex hydrogeological regime in the region, and prediction of the environmental impacts of various management options. It is able to describe temporal and spatial variations in the exchange of water between the land surface, drainage and supply systems, and the aquifers within the area. Management options proposed in the Wakool Land and Water Management Plan have been analysed for the period between 1975 and 2020. Various scenarios such as the implementation of on-farm recycling ponds in conjunction with laser levelling, deep-rooted perennials, tree planting, installation of deep groundwater pumps and the effect of shallow groundwater pumping, were investigated. The results from these simulations indicate that the best option is the implementation of shallow pumping.","December 1998","2015-06-01 19:24:39","2015-06-01 19:24:39","","129-140","","2–3","14","","Environmental Modelling & Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","integrated hydrogeological modelling; MIKE SHE; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; soil salinisation; SPV; sustainable water management; Wakool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The reactivity of heat- and various time-treated acid-hydrolyzed glutens (acid-HGs) and commercial acid-HWP (HWP1), using serum IgE from wheat allergy accompanied by skin and rhinoconjunctival sensitization to HWP1 in the facial soap, pediatric subjects with food allergy to native wheat, adult wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis subjects, and nonatopic healthy subjects, was elucidated by dot blot and a luciferase assay-based in vitro elicitation test (EXiLE test). Results: Serum from subjects sensitized with HWP1 reacted only to acid-HGs (acid-HGs treated for 0.5-3 or 6 h), but not native gluten, in the results of the dot blot. In contrast, sera from pediatric subjects sensitized with native wheat reacted to native gluten more strongly and showed only slight reactions to 0.5- to 1-hour-treated acid-HGs. The results of the in vitro elicitation test showed that acid hydrolyzation of the gluten attenuated antigen-induced luciferase expression in a time-dependent manner for sera from native-wheat-sensitized pediatric subjects. On the other hand, in the sera from HWP1-sensitized subjects, acid hydrolyzation of the gluten for 0.5 h dramatically increased luciferase expression.

Lowering the main-crop stubble height by harvesting the main crop at a lower than traditional height is believed to alter growth parameters and increase ratoon yields. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of main-crop stubble height on ratoon grain yield, agronomics, and cumulative/weekly panicle growth parameters (density, point of origin, and weight). Main-crop ‘Cocodrie’ and ‘Trenasse’ rice cultivars were harvested to leave either a 40- or 20-cm stubble height. When the main-crop stubble was harvested at 20 cm, ratoon rice grain yield in 2007 was increased by 375 and 190 kg ha−1 for Cocodrie and Trenasse, respectively. Yield was not improved in 2006 using the low (20 cm) harvest height. The yield advantage in 2007 was associated with the increased weight of the basal panicles when the main crop was harvested at 20 cm. When the main-crop stubble was 20 cm, basal and axial panicle points of origin were numerically similar 5 weeks after main-crop harvest (WAH), while panicles originating from basal nodes were predominant 6 WAH and beyond. In contrast, when the main-crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes 5 WAH, panicles from both axial and basal points of origin were nearly identical 6 WAH, and basal panicles were dominant thereafter. Results from this study indicate that when the initial stubble height is reduced from 40 to 20 cm the growth of the ratoon crop is altered by shifting panicle point of origin during the early growth period and delaying maturity.","December 12, 2009","2015-06-01 19:37:40","2015-06-01 22:05:31","","396-403","","3","114","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Ratoon; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS; Yield","agronomic traits; grain crops; harvesting; height; inflorescences; Louisiana; Oryza sativa; plant growth; ratooning; rice; seed set; stem nodes; stubble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its growth and development are affected by the environment factors and the growth condition of the main crop. Lowering the maincrop stubble height by harvesting the main crop at a lower than traditional height is believed to alter growth parameters and increase ratoon yields. In order to determine of morphological characteristics on some production parameters and the correlation coefficient of between them, a field experimental was conducted in 2008 at Astara region in a complete block design with 20 genotype and varieties in three replicates. After maturation the main crop, rice was harvested from a height of 20 cm at ground level.

A source of nutrients to surface waters results from fertilizer runoff. Management strategies used to maintain turf on golf courses and recreational fields often include aerification and application of fertilizer. Although research exists on benefits of core cultivation and verticutting (VC) to reduce thatch and the transport of applied chemicals with runoff, there are no studies reporting the effect of coupling these management practices with the goal of further reduction of off-site transport of fertilizer with runoff. We hypothesized that the addition of VC to hollow tine core cultivation (HTCC) would enhance infiltration of precipitation, reduce runoff and nutrient transport with runoff and therefore influence concentrations of nutrients in surface waters receiving runoff from turf managed as a golf course fairway. Greater runoff and mass of soluble phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen transported with runoff were measured from plots managed with HTCC + VC than HTCC; however, the reverse was noted for nitrate nitrogen. Only a portion of the observed trends proved to be statistically significant. Our research showed no reduction or enhancement of risk associated with surface water concentrations of phosphorus or nitrogen, resulting from runoff from creeping bentgrass turf that was managed with HTCC+VC compared to HTCC. Data obtained in this research will be useful to grounds superintendents when selecting best management practices and to scientists seeking data relating runoff to land management for watershed-scale modeling.","July 1, 2013","2015-06-01 19:23:49","2015-06-01 19:23:49","","61-68","","0","456–457","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nitrogen; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Phosphorus; Runoff; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Turf; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In turfgrass, soil fumigants such as methyl bromide are used to control weeds prior to renovation of turf. Environmental concerns have resulted in deregistration of methyl bromide, prompting the need for alternatives. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of MSM on the establishment of selected turfgrass weeds as well as inhibitory effects on establishment of desirable turfgrasses. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2007 at the University of Missouri. MSM was amended in soil at 0, 1,350 (low), 2,350 (medium), and 3,360 kg ha(-1) (high) concentrations. Weed species included annual bluegrass, large crabgrass, buckhorn plantain, white clover, and common chickweed. Turfgrass species included: Rembrandt tall fescue, Evening Shade perennial rye, and Riviera bermudagrass. All species were seeded into soil amended with MSM and either tarped or left untarped. All treatments were compared to dazomet (392 kg ha(-1)), a synthetic standard. Plant counts and biomass of all species were recorded 4 wk after seeding. Overall, tarped treatments suppressed weed emergence 27 to 50% more compared to untarped treatments, except for large crabgrass. High rates of MSM suppressed emergence of all weeds >= 63%. Compared to the untreated control, the density of buckhorn plantain, white clover, and common chickweed was reduced by >= 42% at low rates of MSM. Biomass of buckhorn plantain, annual bluegrass, common chickweed, white clover, and large crabgrass was reduced from 37 to 99% at high rates of MSM. MSM at high rates reduced stand counts of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass up to 81% and 77% respectively, compared to the untreated control. Regardless of MSM rates or tarping, suppression of common bermudagrass emergence did not exceed 30%; tarped treatments actually increased bermudagrass emergence by 22%. The biomass for tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and bermudagrass was reduced by 85, 68, and 10%, respectively, at high rates of MSM. For tall fescue, MSM at all rates strongly suppressed seed germination by 7 d after planting (DAP) (up to 100%), with additional germination observed through 14 DAP, but not thereafter. In both trials, dazomet completely suppressed emergence of all weeds. MSM appears to suppress emergence and growth of a number of weeds common in turf, with potential selectivity for bermudagrass.","OCT-DEC  2010","2015-06-01 17:29:45","2015-06-01 17:29:45","","440-445","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000284185800006","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The seven representatives of BOX-PCR types produced indole acetic acid, reduced acetylene and showed specific immunological cross-reaction with anti-dinitrogenase reductase antibody. Only four types showed mineral phosphate solubilizing ability. Comparison of cellulase and pectinase activities showed differences among different BOX-PCR types.

A cover crop between vine rows can mitigate wind erosion and subsequent damage to young vines. However, low rainfall, gusty winds, and sandy soils that cause significant wind erosion problems can exacerbate cover crop establishment, and cold winters can limit cover crop survival. During 1998, 175 plant accessions were screened for performance as vineyard cover crops at Prosser, Washington. Assessed attributes included percent emergence, percent vegetative cover, stand duration, and plant height. Based on that assessment, seven domestic selections and four foreign Medicago species (medics) were identified for additional evaluation in a research trial in 1999. Additionally, seven accessions and two mixes of species that met the growth criteria and had commercial availability were evaluated in a commercial, drip-irrigated vineyard near Prosser in 1999. Vine water potential and soil moisture were determined in addition to the identical growth criteria from the 1998 study. Cover crop treatments did not lead to detectable water stress in the vines (midday y = -0.84 to -1.30 MPa). However, dry soil between vine rows due to precision drip irrigation inhibited germination and establishment of legumes; therefore, grasses had better emergence rates. Of the mixed species, a grass mix (Canada) composed of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L.), pubescent wheatgrass (Elytrigia intermedia L.), and perennial rye (Lolium perenne L.; 40:40:20), depleted soil water the least and showed the least effect on vine water potential. Early season weeds were suppressed by most cover crop species; however, season-long suppression of weed growth was observed only for the Canada mix and crested wheatgrass cv.

The first crop was harvested with a small plot combine with the cutter bar adjusted to leave a stubble height of 20 or 40 cm. After the main crop harvest, panicles in a flagged 3-m linear section were tagged weekly as they emerged from 3 to 10 weeks after harvesting (WAH). In 2006, ratoon rice yield was not improved when the ratoon stubble was reduced to 20 cm, which was partially due to narrow brown leaf spot outbreak. In 2007, ratoon yields were not limited by the disease, and grain yields were improved when the initial stubble height was 20 cm compared with the traditional 40-cm stubble. When the main crop stubble was 20 cm, the basal and axial panicle points of origin were similar at 5 WAH. A higher density of ratoon panicles originated from basal nodes at 6 WAH and beyond. However, when the main crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes at 5 WAH. Densities of panicles emerging from basal and axial nodes were nearly identical at 6 WAH. After 6 WAH, greater panicle density was observed from basal nodes. Thus, the delay in maturity often associated with shorter main crop stubble heights can be explained partially by the minimum exertion of panicles from tillers originating from axial nodes, which is more prevalent from the taller ratoon stubble associated with a ratoon height of 40 cm.","2009","2015-06-01 18:23:06","2015-06-01 18:23:06","","8-9","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093331791","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field experiment on double cropping of rice was conducted under mid-altitude subtropical wetland valley ecosystem of Meghalaya from 2004-05 to 2005-06 at Umiam (950 m amsl), Meghalaya. Out of the six varieties tested, IR-64 (43.2 q/ha), Aerobic rice IR 72176 (42.1 q/ha) and Krishna Hamsha (40.5 q/ha) performed well during pre-kharif season. Double cropping (main + ratoon) of IR-64 produced 75.4 q/ha of grain yield compared to 40.5 q/ha under improved monocropping of rice variety Sahsarang-1. Ratooning could save time (nursery and field preparation, transplanting, etc.), resources (labour, seeds, etc.) and gave higher productivity. The ratooning ability of Sahsarang-1 (33.0 q/ha) and IR-64 (32.2 q/ha) was found to be highly promising. The sequence IR-64 in pre-kharif followed by its ratoon also gave 86 and 202% higher productivity over improved (40.5 q/ha) and local practice (25.0 q/ha) of monocropping respectively. It was found equally good with the best combination of IR-64 in pre-kharif followed by late kharif transplanted crop of Vivek Dhan-82 (system productivity of 80.4 q grain/ha). Duration of main crop varied from 135 to 158 days, whereas in case of ratoon it varied from 70 to 95 days. Therefore, it was concluded that ratooning has ample opportunity, especially in the NER region of India, where climatic conditions and non-availability of resources restrict the double cropping of rice by the farmers. The practice of double cropping would not only add to the national food basket, but would also increase the farmers' income and generate more employment in the region.","2009","2015-06-01 20:45:26","2015-06-01 22:07:11","","1620-1627","","12","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Mid-altitude; Mono and double cropping; Organic production; Ratooning; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Subtropical wetlands; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need to develop effective strategies for improving crop performance in organic systems through plant breeding. This study evaluated 12 diverse winter wheat breeding lines chosen from conventional and organic breeding nurseries, six historic varieties, and an experimental perennial wheat population under organic management in the Inland Pacific Northwest region of the USA. A randomized complete block design with three replications in two locations over 2 years was used. Based on an analysis of variance, significant genetic differences and crossover interactions across years were found for grain yield, grain percent nitrogen, grain total nitrogen, and aboveground biomass. There were no main effects of locations or location-by-genotype effects for these traits. Based on comparisons among these breeding lines, it appears that there is a possibility of selecting for performance across a limited ecological zone as top-yielding lines were the same in both locations. However, individual entries may have variable performance across years within a single location so selection for stability of performance over years is also necessary. Using an analysis of direct measures of grain yield and grain %N in each location-year combination and overall, we identified breeding lines with relatively high yield, acceptable grain protein, and stable performance over all four location-year combinations. The use of indirect measures or index selection to simultaneously select for grain yield and protein did not appear to be more effective than direct selection based on yield and grain %N measured under organic management.","2011","2015-06-01 20:42:47","2015-06-02 00:09:31","","65-80","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Nitrogen use efficiency; Organic plant breeding; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); Winter wheat; WOS","aboveground biomass; analysis of variance; breeding lines; crops; cultivars; ecological zones; environmental management; grain protein; grain yield; management systems; nitrogen; nitrogen content; organic production; Pacific States; plant breeding; selection index; winter wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all O. sativa varieties, the Sub1 locus encodes the ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) genes Sub1B and Sub1C. A third paralogous ERF gene, Sub1A, is limited to a subset of indica accessions. It is thought that O. sativa was domesticated from the gene pools of the wild perennial species O. rufipogon Griff. and/or the annual species O. nivara Sharma et Shastry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the orthologues of the Sub1 locus in the closest relatives of O. sativa to provide insight into the origin of the gene and allelic variation of the Sub1 locus. Methods: Orthologues of the Sub1 genes were isolated from O. rufipogon and O. nivara by use of oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the most highly conserved regions of the Sub1 genes of domesticated rice. The phylogenetic relatedness of Sub1 genes of O. sativa and its wild relatives was evaluated. Key Results and Conclusions: Both O. rufipogon and O. nivara possess two Sub1 gene orthologues with strong sequence identity to the Sub1B and Sub1C alleles of cultivated rice. The phylogeny of the Sub1 genes of the domesticated and wild rice suggests that Sub1A arose from duplication of Sub1B. Variation in Sub1B alleles is correlated with the absence or presence of Sub1A. Together, the results indicate that genetic variation at the Sub1 locus is due to gene duplication and divergence that have occurred both prior to and after rice domestication.","2009","2015-06-01 20:26:02","2015-06-02 02:03:17","","143-150","","2","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Gene duplication; Oryza nivara; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Sub1 genes; Submergence tolerance; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For flowering time, we find that individual crosses often reveal a simple genetic basis, but that the loci involved almost always vary within species and across environments, indicating a more complex genetic basis species-wide. Similarly, the transition to self-fertilization is often genetically complex, but this seems to depend on the amount of standing variation and time since species divergence. Recent population genomic studies also raise doubts about the long-term adaptive potential of self-fertilization, providing evidence that purifying selection is less effective in highly selfing species.","April 2014","2015-06-01 19:22:39","2015-06-01 19:22:39","","44-50","","0","18","","Current Opinion in Plant Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined two different cases of double MutT/Nudix domain-containing proteins from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Firstly, these double domain proteins were discovered in Drosophila, but only single Nudix domain proteins were found in other animals. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the protein sequence of Nudix_N and Nudix_C from Drosophila, and Nudix from other animals. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the double Nudix domain proteins might have undergone a gene duplication-speciation-fusion process. Secondly, two genes of the MutT family, DR0004 and DR0329, were fused by two mutT gene segments and formed double MutT domain protein genes in Deinococcus radiodurans. The evolutionary tree of bacterial MutT proteins suggested that the double MutT domain proteins in D. radiodurans probably resulted from a gene duplication-fusion event after speciation. Gene duplication-fusion is a basic and important gene innovation mechanism for the evolution of double MutT/Nudix domain proteins. Independent gene duplication-fusion events resulted in similar domain architectures of different double MutT/Nudix domain proteins.","October 2009","2015-06-01 19:23:51","2015-06-01 19:23:51","","603-610","","10","36","","Journal of Genetics and Genomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deinococcus; DNA repair; Drosophila; gene duplication-fusion; MutT/Nudix superfamily; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In China, especially in the Chengdu plain where rice-wheat cropping system is practiced, productivity and soil fertility was enhanced and sustained. This paper reviews the relevant data and experiences on rice-wheat cropping in the Chengdu Plain from 1977 to 2006. The principal sustainable strategies used for rice-wheat cropping systems in Chengdu Plain included: 1) creating a favorable environment and viable rotations; 2) balanced fertilization for maintenance of sustainable soil productivity; 3) improvement of crop management for higher efficiency; and 4) use the newest cultivars and cultivation techniques to upgrade the production level. Future research is also discussed in the paper as: 1) the constant topic: a highly productive and efficient rice-wheat cropping system for sustainable growth; 2) the future trend: simplified cultivation techniques for the rice-wheat cropping system; 3) the foundation: basic research for continuous innovation needed for intensive cropping.

A study was established in 1990 to determine NO3-N extraction ability to 300 cm; initial soil NO3-N concentrations were high (>8 mg kg(-1)). Systems included continuous alfalfa; annual rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); a native-grass system [big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.)]; and continuous fallow. The annual rotation effectively lowered NO3-N to <2.3 mg kg(-1) in the 30- to 90-cm depth. By the 4th yr, alfalfa had reduced NO3-N concentrations to <3.8 mg kg(-1) for the 30- to 240-cm increment. The greatest NO3-N extraction benefits of alfalfa were realized in the 4th yr at a maximum soil depth of 270 cm. Subsoil NO3-N concentration increased in the continuous alfalfa between the 4th and 6th yr. Greater NO3-N extraction occurred with the native-grass treatment compared with continuous alfalfa in the 0- to 120-cm soil depth; however, similar extraction patterns existed below 120 cm.

H.","Extremophile-inspired strategies for enzymatic biomass saccharification","Environmental Technology","","0959-3330","10.1080/09593330903536113","","Domestic ethanol production in the USA relies on starch feedstocks using a first generation bioprocess. Enzymes that contribute to this industry remain of critical value in new and established markets as commodity additives and for in planta production. A transition to non-food feedstocks is both desirable and essential to enable larger scale production. This objective would relieve dependence on foreign oil and strengthen the national economy. Feedstocks derived from corn stover, wheat straw, perennial grasses and timber require pretreatment to increase the accessibility of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates to commodity enzymes for saccharification, which is followed by fermentation-based conversion of monosaccharides to ethanol. Hot acid pretreatment is the industrial standard method used to achieve deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, enzymes that tolerate both acid and heat may contribute toward the improvement of lignocellulosic biomass processing. These enzymes are produced naturally by extremely thermophilic microbes, sometimes called extremophiles. This review summarizes information on enzymes from selected (acido)thermophiles that mediate saccharification of - and ss-linked carbohydrates of relevance to biomass processing.","2010","2015-06-01 17:46:28","2015-06-01 17:46:28","","1005-1015","","8-9","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000278781700016","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methods for the dissolution of lignocellulosic biomass in conventional solvents are complex and tedious due to the complex chemical ultra-structure of biomass. In view of this, recent developments for the use of ionic liquid solvent (IL) has received great attention, as ILs can solubilise such complex biomass and thus provides industrial scale-up potential. In this review, we have discussed the state-of-art for the dissolution of lignocellulosic material in representative ILs.

However, no weed species was listed by more than 41% of farmers statewide suggesting that relatively unique weed management problems may exist on many farms. Also, the perceived importance of most weed species varied substantially among Indiana's nine districts.

Landscape structure, function, and change are assessed for the northern Ecuadorian Amazon by examining the composition and spatial organization of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and secondary plant succession at the farm level in 1990 and 1999 through the integration of data from a satellite time-series, a longitudinal household survey, and GIS coverages. Pattern metrics were calculated at the farm level through the generation of a hybrid land use and land cover (LULC) digital classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Population, labor, and other household variables were generated from a scientific sample of survey farms or fincas interviewed in 1990 and resurveyed in 1999. Topography, soils, and distance and geographic accessibility measures were derived for sample farms through a GIS as well as qualitative assessments from household surveys. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were generated for 155 and 157 fincas in 1990 and 1999, respectively, using pattern metrics at the landscape level as dependent variables, and biophysical, geographical, and socio-economic/demographic variables as independent variables. The models were derived to explore the changing nature of LULC at the finca level by assessing the variation in the spatial structure or organization of farm landscapes in 1990 and 1999, and the extent to which this variation could be explained by the available data. Results indicate rapid population growth causing substantial subdivision of plots, which in turn has created a more complex and fragmented landscape in 1999 than in 1990. Key factors predicting landscape complexity are population size and composition, plot fragmentation through subdivision, expansion of the road and electrical networks, age of the plot (1990 only), and topography. The research demonstrates that the process of combining data from household surveys, satellite time-series images, and GIS coverages provide an ideal framework to examine population–environment interactions and that the statistical models presented are powerful tools to combine such data in an integrated way.","February 2004","2015-06-01 19:25:21","2015-06-01 19:25:21","","117-134","","2–3","101","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural extensification; Deforestation; Empirical models; GIS coverages; Northeastern Ecuador; Pattern metrics; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Satellite time-series; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined an intermated Oryza sativa/Oryza longistaminata population and assessed how fertility barriers affected selection for long rhizomes, a polygenic trait. Rhizomes are typical of O. longistaminata but not found in O. sativa. In the intermate population, we observed that pollen-fertility and self-fertility were generally low but exceptional individuals of high fertility were found in nearly all generations. About 1/5th of the genotypic variation for self-fertility was accounted for by pollen-fertility, based on a significant linear regression. Intermating improved self-fertility more than backcrossing for one generation. Heritability estimates via parent-offspring regression were 17 ± 7% for pollen-fertility and 39 ± 9% for self-fertility. The data indicated that many genes contributed to the fertility barriers. Individuals with relatively high fertility or long rhizomes (&gt;8 cm) were observed infrequently in the intermated population, and there was no evidence of association between low fertility and presence of long rhizomes. By evaluating a large population, we were able to obtain a few rare recombinants that had both self-fertility greater than 10% and long rhizomes.","2006","2015-06-01 20:26:22","2015-06-01 22:22:23","","30-38","","1","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Crossability; Fertility; Intermating; Interspecific crosses; Introgression; Oryza longistaminata; Oryza sativa; Perennial upland rice; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rhizome; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elevated CH4 emissions in rice systems can lead to a high global warming potential (GWP) relative to other crops, thus strategies to reduce greenhouse (GHG) emissions, particularly CH4, are needed. Altering water, residue (carbon) and fertilizer management practices are commonly suggested as options for mitigating GHG emissions in rice systems. While the effects of water and residue management have been reported on elsewhere, the impact of fertilizer management on GHG emissions has not been reviewed quantitatively. We conducted an exhaustive search of peer-reviewed field studies that compared various side-by-side fertilizer management options. Where sufficient studies were available a meta-analysis was conducted to determine average treatment effects of management practices on both CH4 and N2O emissions. Results show that low inorganic fertilizer N rates (averaging 79 kg N ha−1) increased CH4 emissions by 18% relative to when no N fertilizer was applied, while high N rates (average of 249 kg N ha−1) decreased CH4 emissions by 15%. Replacing urea with ammonium sulfate at the same N rate significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 40%, but may increase N2O emissions. Overall, the fertilizer-induced emission factor for all inorganic N sources was 0.22%. Dicyandiamide (DCD), a nitrification inhibitor, led to lower emissions of both CH4 (−18%) and N2O (−29%). Limited field data suggest that deep placement of N fertilizer reduces CH4 emissions but increases N2O emissions. When compared to inorganic N fertilizers, farmyard manure (FYM) increased CH4 emissions by 26% and the green manure (GrM) Sesbania by 192%. Neither FYM nor GrM had a significant impact on N2O emissions when compared to an inorganic N treatment at the same N rate. Sulfate fertilizers reduced CH4 emissions by 28% and 53% at average rates of 208 and 992 kg S ha−1, respectively. These findings demonstrate that a variety of fertilizer management practices affect GHG emissions from rice systems. To develop effective GHG mitigation strategies future work is needed to (i) quantify the effects on GWP (accounting for both CH4 and N2O emissions), (ii) investigate options for combining mitigation practices (e.g. deep placement of ammonium sulfate), and (iii) determine the economic viability of these practices.","August 30, 2012","2015-06-01 19:38:08","2015-06-01 19:38:08","","10-21","","0","135","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Inhibitor; Manure; Meta-analysis; Methane; Mitigation; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Sulfate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of 21 field fertilizer tests harvested during the year ending June 30, 1941, are given. The tests were conducted at several locations, some on flood-fallowed front-land, and some on pegassy clay soils. These tests showed that nitrochalk, cyanamide, and NaNO3 were as efficient as (NH4)2SO4 in increasing the yield of sugarcane. Most of the tests on pegassy clay soils in the past have indicated 500 to 600 lb. of (NH4)2SO4 per acre to be the opt. application, but a smaller opt. application was found this yr. due to abnormal weather conditions. Positive response to phosphate was obtained on a pegassy clay soil containing 296 ppm. of available P2O5, but not on a flood-fallowed front-land containing 10 ppm. available P2O5. Curacao rock phosphate, basic slag, superphosphate, and Nicifos were satisfactory sources of phosphate. Locations are given where responses are likely to be obtained from phosphate fertilization, and another list is given where responses may be expected from the use of potash. On the flood-fallowed frontlands 1/2-1 ton of liming material per acre, applied at each replanting, gave slight but not significant increases in yield. On pegassy clay 2 tons of limestone per acre gave a significant increase in the yield of plant cane. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. G.

Intercropping could ensure stability of insect populations in a system. A 3-yr (2005-2007) field trial was therefore carried out in Nigeria under regular and ratoon crops to evaluate five recently developed pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Huth) genotypes (ICPL 87, ICPL 161, ICPL 85063, ICP 7120, and ICPL 87119) from the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and one local variety for their relative performance and susceptibility to insect pests. The pigeon pea genotypes were in a mixture with two maize genotypes (Zea mays L., open-pollinated and hybrid) in regular crops for 2 yr (2005-2006) followed by a ratoon crop for 1 yr (2007). Termites (Odontotermes badius), crickets (Gymnogryllus lucens), and variegated grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) were the crop's seedling pests and caused minimal damage. Clavigralla spp. infestations were high at the reproductive stage causing 24% and 29% seed damage in regular and ratoon pigeon pea crops, respectively. Maize slightly suppressed insect pest incidence and damage to pigeon pea pods and seeds but significantly (P < 0.01) reduced grain yield in the regular pigeon pea crops in 2005 and 2006, although not in the 2007 ratoon. The pigeon pea genotypes differed significantly (P < 0.05) in pest incidence at the podding stage in both the regular and ratoon crops and in grain yield (P < 0.01) for the regular crop. Grain yield of the pigeon pea ratoon crops was about 60% of the regular crop.

We introduce the concept of ‘farmer-managed aquatic systems’ (FMAS) to capture the diversity of these resource systems at the interface of aquaculture and capture fisheries and characterize FMAS in contrasting agro-ecosystems of Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodian and Thai FMAS yielded primarily self-recruiting species (SRS) and were managed to allow or attract them, while Vietnamese FMAS were managed more intensively to produce mostly hatchery-reared species. More than 90% of rice farming households in the study areas of Cambodia and Thailand harvested aquatic animals from their land, and about 70% created aquatic habitats such as ponds in addition to rice fields in order to increase aquatic resource production. Cambodian households created and utilized a wide variety of man-made aquatic habitats, while Thai households created predominantly trap ponds. In contrast, less than half of Vietnamese farming households harvested SRS and very few undertook FMAS management specifically for them. Vietnamese FMAS were intensively stocked and managed as aquaculture systems, with SRS accounting for less than 30% of production. Nonetheless, SRS production per area of FMAS was comparable in the three countries. Contrasting FMAS characteristics in different study areas reflect underlying differences in agro-ecosystems, aquaculture technologies, farmer livelihoods and markets.","November 16, 2009","2015-06-01 19:24:23","2015-06-01 19:24:23","","219-226","","3–4","296","","Aquaculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agro-ecosystem; Farmer managed aquatic systems; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rice farming landscape; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Self-recruiting species; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our purpose was to evaluate five year-round forage systems for their capacity to remove P from a dairy sprayfield. The soil is a Kershaw sand (thermic, uncoated Typic Quartzipsamment). Systems included bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.)-rye (Secale cereale L.) (BR), perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.)-rye (PR), corn (Zea mays L.)-forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-rye (CSR), corn-bermudagrass-rye (CBR), and corn-perennial peanut-rye (CPR). Forages were grown for five 12-mo cycles. Effluent P rates were 80, 120, and 165 kg ha-1 cycle-1. The 5-cycle P removal was 67 kg ha-1 cycle-1 for BR, 54 kg ha-1 for CBR, 52 kg for CSR, 45 kg for PR, and 43 for CPR. Removal of P by winter rye was low. There were differences in system rankings among cycles primarily due to changes in the performance of perennial forages. In the first two cycles, BR had the greatest P removal (91 kg ha-1 cycle-1) due to high bermudagrass yield and P concentration. In the first cycle, P removal was lowest for PR (36 kg ha-1) because perennial peanut was slow to establish. In later cycles, P removal for BR declined because bermudagrass yield and P concentration declined. It increased for PR because peanut yield increased. The yield of corn in CBR, CPR, and CSR was consistently high but P concentration was modest (avg. 2.2 g kg-1). Sorghum produced moderate but stable yield and had low P levels (avg. 1.8 g kg-1). Effluent rate marginally affected the performance of most grasses. For P recovery in dairy sprayfields in northern Florida, the best warm-season forage would likely be a high yielding, persistent bermudagrass.","2007","2015-06-01 20:29:30","2015-06-02 00:13:09","","175-183","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass""); WOS","application rate; bioaccumulation; chemical constituents of plants; cropping systems; crop yield; dairy farming; dry matter accumulation; effluents; Florida; forage crops; phosphorus; pollution control; wastewater irrigation; water pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A practical way to improve hybrid seed production is to increase the outcrossing rate in rice. Several studies reveal that perennial wild Oryza species have a higher outcrossing rate than annual species. Among various traits that influence outcrossing, pistil characteristics are the most crucial in improving the seed set on the male sterile parent in hybrid seed production. Wild species are known to have wide genetic variability for stigma length, anther length, and percent stigma exsertion. This review establishes the need to exploit new genetic resources, through both classical and molecular breeding approaches, to improve seed production. It also reviews the genetic variability of floral characteristics, the genetics of floral traits that influence outcrossing, and progress made in understanding these traits using biotechnological approaches, the effect of environment on floral traits and the resulting prospects for improving hybrid rice seed production.","JAN  2015","2015-06-01 17:25:55","2015-06-01 17:25:55","","1-14","","1","201","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000346023200001","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hybrid forage sorghums (HFS) and sorghum-sudangrass hybrids (SSG) are capable of impressive biomass yields and tolerance to environmental stress. Multiple vegetative harvests (ratoon harvests) of sorghum are possible and there are photoperiod-sensitive sorghums that remain vegetative. However, the response of newer HFS and SSG cultivars to harvest management practices designed for forage or cellulosic feedstock production has not been fully investigated in all environments. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine biomass production and quality characteristics of a genetically diverse range of HFS, SSG and sudangrass cultivars and evaluate their interaction with harvest system; and (ii) provide data to aid selection of sorghum cultivars for both forage and biofuel uses. Mean yield across all entries and years for a single late season harvest was 27.1 Mg ha(-1) of dry matter per year. Mean total yield for a first harvest plus a ratoon crop was 25.5 Mg ha(-1) of dry matter per year. However, entries varied for yield and interacted with harvest system. Mean caloric value was 16.5 Gj Mg-1 and modest differences were observed among cultivars evaluated. The best performing entry (cv.

Perennial wheats Nos 818 and 823, from selections from the F 5 of a cross Truicum sphaero-coccum x Agropyron elongatum, when sown in autumn 1944, came through the winter with survival rates of 97.2% and 97.0% respectively, compared with a survival of 76.2% in the winter wheat Hostianurn 237. Earing was 8-10 days later than in Hostianum 237 and the period from earing to ripening was longer. Observations on 474 different forms of perennial wheat in 1944 and 1945, both bad years for fungus attack, showed 469 of them to be entirely free from brown rust and only one was infected badly; all forms remained free from yellow rust and all but two free from mildew. The average grain yield per plant in Nos 818 and 823 was 3.6 grm. but some yielded up to 8 grm. per plant. Both these hybrids have awnless ears with smooth chaff and tough rachis, are difficult to thresh and have short, red, vitreous or semi-vitreous grain, with a thousand corn weight of 18 grm. Nos 559 and 560, from the F 4 of a cross of the winter wheat Lutescens 329 x A. elongatum, yielded only 0.67 grm. of grain per plant, being characterized by open flowering and cross-pollination; they had large, red, vitreous grains with a thousand corn weight of 26 grm All the perennial wheats have a number of defects such as late maturity, rough ears and small grain and further breeding work is being directed towards removing these defects. Among the more recent hybrids, one series, obtained from the F 6 of a cross T. sphaer-ococcum x A. elongatum, bore ears in 1944 and 1945 and tillered again at the end of 1945 in preparation for a third year. The ears contained over 50 grains each and some as many as 70, owing to the large number of florets per spikelet. The ears and grain were of the wheat type. Another promising hybrid, No. 2271, was selected from the F 4 of a cross of Lutescens 329 x A. elongatum; it has borne ears for two successive years, and in the first winter it had a survival rate of 94.6% as compared with 76.2%; its ears are of the wheat type and it has not been attacked by brown or yellow rust or by mildew. Plants with a still more wheat-like ear were selected from the F 3 of a cross T. turgidum x A. glaucum; when sown in autumn 1943 they bore ears in 1945 and in autumn tillered afresh, producing a good growth in spring 1946; the grain was vitreous and wheat-like. A number of other wheat-like hybrids have the faculty, when autumn sown, of producing a crop of grain and then tillering afresh and producing a hay crop, after which they die. The highest grain yield from these types was obtained in 1945 with 14.88 c. per ha These hybrids are awnless, have wheat-like ears and grain and have remained free from attack by brown and yellow rust and mildew. The yield of autumn hay varied from 12 to 24 c. per ha. By sowing them in the spring two hay crops are obtained, in the autumn of the first and second year respectively, with a grain crop in between. Further selection work is being continued with this type.","1946","2015-06-01 17:55:32","2015-06-01 17:55:32","","145-51","","2-3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19481601518","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High levels of amino acid similarity between the fructosyltransferases responsible for fructan accumulation indicates that they may have evolved from invertase-like ancestral genes. In this study, we have applied comparative genomics to determine the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of fructosytransferase and invertase genes in rice, perennial ryegrass, and wheat. Duplications and rearrangements have been inferred to generate variant forms of the rice invertases since divergence from a common grass progenitor. The occurrence of multiple copies of fructosyltransferase genes indicated that duplication events continued during evolution of the wheat and perennial ryegrass lineages. Further gene rearrangements were evident in perennial ryegrass genes, albeit at a reduced level compared with the rice invertases. Gene orthologs were largely static after duplication during evolution of the wheat lineage. This study details evolutionary events that contribute to fructosyltransferase and invertase gene variation in grasses.","2006","2015-06-01 20:43:17","2015-06-02 00:14:38","","1081-1091","","9","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Comparative genomics; Fructosyltransferase; Gene rearrangement; Genome evolution; Invertase; Scopus; search.rice; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (oryza OR rice)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","amino acid sequences; beta-fructofuranosidase; carbohydrate metabolism; evolution; fructans; gene duplication; genes; genomics; hexosyltransferases; Lolium perenne; nucleotide sequences; Oryza sativa; plant stress; rice; sequence analysis; stress tolerance; Triticum aestivum; vacuoles; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observations are reported which indicate that the local inhabitants have in the past collected the seed of this wild rye for sowing. In spite of a number of defects such as low cold and drought resistance, brittle ear, irregular maturity, susceptibility to rust, etc., it is superior to other perennial ryes in its greater earliness, size of grain, compactness of growth and its capacity to maintain its green condition even at maturity of grain. By late sowing it has even been possible to select lines which ripen when spring sown, which has not previously been possible in perennial ryes. Inbreeding is being practised and by this means certain comparatively self-fertile lines have been isolated which give 30-46 grains per ear. A great many crosses of it with cultivated rye have also been made and the percentage successes in different crosses are tabulated. The perennial habit is dominant in the F 1 and it is thought that hybrids of this kind, combining the perennial habit with the cultivated type of grain, could be used in cultivation; the chief disadvantage up to the present is that lateness and brittleness of ear are also dominant. Large numbers of crosses are being made in the attempt to find combinations in which these undesirable features are absent and at the same time to utilize the phenomenon of heterosis. For the purpose of making these crosses on a mass scale it is necessary to adjust the time of flowering, cultivated rye being about 10 days earlier than S. kuprijanovi; this is achieved either by sowing the latter in spring after vernalization or by cutting down the cultivated rye at the time when the stems begin to elongate. S. kuprijanovi has possibilities as a forage plant and breeding for this purpose is recommended too.","1935","2015-06-01 17:39:49","2015-06-01 17:39:49","","159-65","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19361600868","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although subterranean NOGT and DGT buds appear similar, they display different responses to gravity and perhaps other cues governing branch angle and overall growth habit (GH). Leymus wildryes show remarkable variation in GH and include some of the largest native grasses in western North America. Previous studies detected GH QTLs on homoeologous regions of LG3a and LG3b controlling differences between caespitose Leymus cinereus and rhizomatous Leymus triticoides allotetraploids. Heterologous barley and wheat microarrays in conjunction with bulk segregate analysis were used to find gene expression polymorphisms associated with GH QTLs. Approximately 34% and 25% of the probe sets showed detectable signals on the barley and wheat arrays, respectively.

Transgene escape to wild Oryza species having AA-genome will occur if GM rice is released to environments with these wild Oryza species. Transgenes may persist to and spread in wild populations after gene flow, resulting unwanted ecological consequences. For assessing the potential consequences caused by transgene escape, it is important to understand the actual gene flow frequencies from GM rice to wild relatives, transgene expression and inheritance in the wild relatives, as well as fitness changes that brought to wild relatives by the transgenes. This article reviews studies on transgene escape from rice to its wild relatives via gene flow and its ecological consequences.

The fewest ecological risks of pollen flow are posed to the natural environment, as there are few crops growing in or near pristine environments that have interbreeding relatives, or bear traits that could disrupt ecological balances. Some seed-expressed traits might pose an agro-ecological risk if introgressed into related weeds. Only pharmaceutical or industrial seed-expressed traits are likely to introgress into other varieties of a crop at regulatory red flag levels due to zero tolerance at the most sensitive levels of detection when grown at normal separation distances. Other traits would be below regulatory thresholds if required separations distances are met. Two of the three transgenic containment methods described (plastome transformation, attenuated viruses) are unlikely to work with seed-expressed traits. Transgenic mitigation could be used where the seed-expressed trait is linked with a trait that is positive or neutral to a crop but deleterious to its wild or weedy relative. Typical mitigation traits are dwarfing, no seed shattering, and lack of secondary dormancy. There are special mitigator genes, such as transgenically dominant sugary endosperm that might be appropriate for pharmaceutical traits. Biosafety gene flow protection mechanisms are also needed to prevent wild type poisonous seed crops (e.g. castor and Jatropha) from introgressing toxin genes into seeds of varieties where these toxins have been transgenically eliminated.","December 2010","2015-06-01 19:24:59","2015-06-01 19:24:59","","630-634","","6","179","","Plant Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biosafety; Gene flow; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Transgene mitigation; Transgenic pharmaceuticals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolution of annual O. nivara from a perennial ancestor resembling its sister species, O. rufipogon, was associated with an ecological shift from persistently wet to seasonally dry habitats. Here we report a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of phenotypic differentiation in life history, mating system, and flowering time between O. nivara and O. rufipogon. The exponential distribution of effect sizes of QTL fits the prediction of a recently proposed population genetic model of adaptation. More than 80% of QTL alleles of O. nivara acted in the same direction of phenotypic evolution, suggesting that they were fixed under directional selection. The loss of photoperiod sensitivity, which might be essential to the survival of the ancestral populations of O. nivara in the new environment, was controlled by QTL of relatively large effect. Mating system evolution from cross- to self-fertilization through the modification of panicle and floral morphology was controlled by QTL of small-to-moderate effect. The lack of segregation of the recessive annual habit in the F2 mapping populations suggested that the evolution of annual from perennial life form had a complex genetic basis.

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species.

We conducted a wide collection of Oryza species in Niger and characterize its diversity with microsatellites (or simple sequence repeats, SSR). The aims of this research were to get a better understanding of the extent of genetic diversity, its structure and partition within rice eco-geographical zones of Niger. There were 264 accessions found in farmers’ and other fields: 173 O. sativa (Asia’s rice), 65 O. glaberrima (Africa’s rice), 25 O. barthii, and 1 O. longistaminata (weedy perennial rice), which were genotyped with 18 SSR. A total of 178 alleles were detected, with a mean of 9.89 alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content was 0.65 and heterozygosity was estimated as 0.14. Two main well-differentiate genotypic groups, which correspond to Asian and African rice species, were identified. The SSR set divided the Asia’s rice group (solely indica) into irrigated and floating rice, with rainfed lowland rice in between. The African rice species group was composed of O. glaberrima, O. longistaminata and O. barthii accessions, but without any clear genetic differentiation among them likely due admixtures within the samples of O. barthii. Five accessions that could be natural interspecific hybrids were too admixed for assigning them to any of the two well-differentiated groups. The partitioning of the overall diversity showed that maximum variation was within genotypic groups and subgroups or cropping ecologies, rather than between eco-geographical zones. The eco-geographical distribution of the diversity suggests germplasm exchange in Niger.

A relatively high species-level genetic diversity and low population-level genetic diversity exist in this species, and large genetic differentiation exists between two main populations with significant geographical isolation. Based on a previous artificial simulation mating test, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker was used in the present study to assess genetic diversity of filial generation colonies generated by different mating modes and to clarify genetic effects of various mating modes. The filial generation colonies generated by natural pollination and by geitonogamy were found to be similar to each other in terms of their relatively low genetic parameters and minimum genetic differentiation. This indicated that under natural conditions, selfing might occur at a higher proportion leading to the low genetic diversity within the population. The degree of genetic diversity of the filial generation colonies generated by outbreeding was highest, followed by inbreeding (xenogamy) and selfing (geitonogamy). Moreover, genetic differentiation between filial generation colonies generated by selfing (geitonogamy) and inbreeding (i.e., xenogamy) was much smaller than that between filial generation colonies generated by selfing and outbreeding. The results indicated that the genetic effect of outbreeding was much more dominant than other mating modes. Therefore, artificially promoting outbreeding between the two isolated geographically populations contributed to the enhancement of genetic diversity in populations in S. chinensis.","June 2014","2015-06-01 19:22:13","2015-06-01 19:22:13","","8-14","","0","54","","Biochemical Systematics and Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","genetic diversity; Genetic effect; Mating system; Outbreeding; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Sinocalycanthus chinensis; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty local isolates of WSMV were collected from 2008 to 2010 near Lewiston, ID, Pullman, WA, and the United States Department of Agriculture Central Ferry Research Station, near Pomeroy, WA to determine the amount of genetic variation present in the region. The coat protein gene from each isolate was sequenced and the data subjected to four different methods of phylogenetic analyses. Two well-supported clades of WSMV were identified. Isolates in clade I share sequence similarity with isolates from Central Europe; this is the first report of isolates from Central Europe being reported in the United States. Isolates in clade II are similar to isolates originating from Australia, Argentina, and the American Pacific Northwest. Nine isolates showed evidence of recombination and the same two well-supported clades were observed when recombinant isolates were omitted from the analysis. More polymorphic sites, parsimony informative sites, and increased diversity were observed in clade II than clade I, suggesting more recent establishment of the virus in the latter. The observed diversity within both clades could make breeding for durable disease resistance in perennial wheat difficult if there is a differential response of WSMV resistance genes to isolates from different clades.","2013","2015-06-01 20:42:39","2015-06-02 00:21:31","","98-104","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such a meta-analysis poses significant challenges with respect to data comparability and normalization, systematic sample annotation, and analysis tools. Genevestigator addresses these issues using a large curated expression database and a set of specifically developed analysis tools that are accessible over the internet. This combination has already proven to be useful in the area of plant research based on a large set of Arabidopsis data (Grennan, 2006). Here, we present the release of the Genevestigator rice and barley gene expression databases that contain quality-controlled and well annotated microarray experiments using ontologies. The databases currently comprise experiments from pathology, plant nutrition, abiotic stress, hormone treatment, genotype, and spatial or temporal analysis, but are expected to cover a broad variety of research areas as more experimental data become available. The transcriptome meta-analysis of the model species rice and barley is expected to deliver results that can be used for functional genomics and biotechnological applications in cereals.","September 2008","2015-06-01 19:22:27","2015-06-01 19:22:27","","851-857","","5","1","","Molecular Plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ratoon crop is receiving increasing attention in US rice production systems due to the increasing prevalence of early-maturing genotypes with good ratoon-yield potential, and the economic pressure on producers to maximize seasonal yields. Field studies were conducted in 2002 through 2005 to evaluate the influence of gibberellin (GA) applied to the main crop on ratoon-rice yields. Gibberellin at 10 g ai/ha was applied when the main-crop was between 3 days post-flowering and soft-dough. Various cultivars were tested in field research plots at two locations in Texas. The data were analyzed using a paired t-test of medians to evaluate GA-treated plots compared to nontreated plots. Main-crop yields were not influenced by application of GA, while ratoon-crop yields were increased 264 kg/ha by the GA application. Ratoon-crop yields were higher in GA-treated plots vs. nontreated plots in 14 of 17 studies. The very early-maturing vigorous hybrids responded strongly to GA treatment, with average increases in ratoon yield due to the GA treatment of 697 kg/ha.

Selecting varieties that better use organic N could be important in maximizing productivity in organic and low-input systems because these varieties may access a wider pool of available nutrients. We tested amino acid-N uptake by wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings over 24 h over a range of soil glycine concentrations. Wheat was grown in 5 ml pipette tips for 10 days prior to labeling with 14C-labeled glycine. In a second experiment, uptake of amino acid-N relative to nitrate and ammonium was tested in three pre-1940 wheat varieties (Arco, Idaed, and Red Fife), three modern varieties (Alpowa, Madsen, and Zak), and one perennial wheat variety (unreleased). Glycine-N was detected in all shoots (with the exception of the lowest soil concentration) and increased with increasing soil concentration. There were few differences in uptake between individual varieties tested but seedlings of modern varieties were more efficient at capturing organic N than classic varieties. Glycine-N constituted between 3.9% and 8.1% of total N uptake over 24 h and constituted a significantly greater proportion of total N in perennial wheat than annual wheat varieties. These results show that there may be sufficient varietal differences in organic N uptake in wheat to warrant selection for this trait in breeding programs targeted to improving N use efficiency.","2009","2015-06-01 20:43:05","2015-06-02 00:23:11","","723-732","","7","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Amino acid uptake; Organic farming; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); Wheat varieties; WOS","amino acids; nutrient uptake; organic nitrogen compounds; organic production; Triticum aestivum; varieties; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In turn, the capacity of a destination to consume assimilates is conditioned by their metabolic activity. Despite its importance, the relationship between the glyphosate and the sugar synthesis from source leaves has been little studied. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of glyphosate on the growth and free sugar accumulation of two Lolium perenne biotypes of low and high glyphosate sensitivity. It was worked with clones of both types, in tillering, sprayed with 1,440 g a.e. ha-1 of glyphosate as treatments and without herbicide as controls. The glyphosate effects on the regrowth of leaves was studied until 50 hours post-application and on total free sugar, reducing free sugar and nonreducing free sugar from leaves to 1, 2, 3 and 5 days post-application were periodically evaluated. From 25 hours after glyphosate application, it caused on the susceptible biotype a growth decrease of 58% and an accumulation of free sugar above 90% compared to controls. In susceptible biotypes, growth inhibition does not depend on a reduced photoassimilate translocation from the overground part. Therefore, the free sugar accumulation in leaves could be explained by the fall in the rate of growth. These effects are limited in the low sensitivity biotype, where growth inhibition has not been detected.","2012","2015-06-01 20:28:42","2015-06-01 20:28:42","","155-164","","1","30","","","Efecto del glifosato sobre el crecimiento y acumulación de azúcares libres en dos biotipos de lolium perenne de distinta sensibilidad al herbicida","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Herbicide resistance; perennial rye grass; Photoassimilates; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is easily translocated from shoot to roots and released into the rhizosphere, where it is immobilized at the soil matrix or microbially degraded. However, contradictory results are reported in the literature concerning the bio-availability of glyphosate residues in soils and the potential risks for intoxication of non-target organisms. This study addresses the question whether plant residues of glyphosate-treated weeds (model plant perennial rye grass, Lolium perenne L.) or direct soil application of glyphosate bears an intoxication risk for subsequently cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings. The experiments were conducted as greenhouse studies on two soils with contrasting properties (acidic, sandy Arenosol, calcareous loess subsoil). Also the potential role of different waiting times between glyphosate application and sunflower cultivation was considered. On both soils, sunflower seedling growth and biomass production was strongly impaired by glyphosate pre-sowing treatments in the variants with 0 d waiting time and recovered within a waiting time of 7-21 d. Generally, the detrimental effects were more pronounced after glyphosate weed application (90% biomass reduction) compared with direct soil application (55-70% biomass reduction) at waiting time 0 d. The inhibitory effects on seedling growth were associated with a corresponding increase in shikimate accumulation in the root tissue as physiological indicator for glyphosate toxicity. Glyphosate intoxication of sunflower seedlings was also associated with an impairment of the manganese-nutritional status, which was still detectable after a waiting time of up to 21 d, particularly on the Arenosol in the variants with glyphosate weed application. These findings indicate an important and yet uninvestigated role of glyphosate in plant residues in determining the risk of non-target plant intoxication.","2009","2015-06-01 20:29:10","2015-06-02 00:26:19","","126-132","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Glyphosate; Manganese; Micronutrient; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); Rye grass; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; Shikimate; SPV; Sunflower; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","acid soils; bioavailability; calcareous soils; dry matter accumulation; field crops; forage grasses; grass weeds; half life; Helianthus annuus; herbicide residues; Lolium perenne; manganese; nontarget organisms; nutrient uptake; phytotoxicity; plant nutrition; plant residues; rhizosphere; seedling growth; soil treatment; sunflower seed products; temporal variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to determine the molecular and biochemical basis conferring glyphosate resistance in this species. Experiments were conducted to assess target EPSPS gene sequences and 14C-glyphosate leaf absorption and translocation to meristematic tissues. Results: Individuals of all resistant (R) accessions exhibited significantly less glyphosate translocation to root (11% versus 29%) and stem (9% versus 26%) meristems when compared with susceptible (S) plants. A notably higher proportion of the applied glyphosate remained in the treated leaves of R plants (63%) than in the treated leaves of S plants (27%). In addition, individuals of S. halepense accession R 2 consistently showed lower glyphosate absorption rates in both adaxial (10-20%) and abaxial (20-25%) leaf surfaces compared with S plants. No glyphosate resistance endowing mutations in the EPSPS gene at Pro-101-106 residues were found in any of the evaluated R accessions. Conclusion: The results of the present investigation indicate that reduced glyphosate translocation to meristems is the primary mechanism endowing glyphosate resistance in S. halepense from cropping fields in Argentina. To a lesser extent, reduced glyphosate leaf uptake has also been shown to be involved in glyphosate-resistant S. halepense.","2012","2015-06-01 20:41:51","2015-06-02 00:27:15","","430-436","","3","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Glyphosate leaf uptake; Glyphosate translocation; Non-target-site resistance mechanism; Perennial Johnsongrass weed; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","absorption; Argentina; field crops; genes; gene targeting; glyphosate; leaves; meristems; mutation; nucleotide sequences; Sorghum halepense; stems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In S. halepense and in the majority of reported cases in L. rigidum the glyphosate resistance trait has been associated with a mechanism that reduces glyphosate translocation within plants. Here, the significant decrease in the glyphosate resistance level when resistant plants of S. halepense and L. rigidum are grown at suboptimal cool temperature conditions is reported. Results: Lowering temperature from 30 to 19°C in S. halepense and from 19 to 8°C in L. rigidum significantly reduced both plant survival and above-ground biomass produced by glyphosate-resistant plants. Thus, glyphosate resistance parameters significantly decreased when glyphosate-treated resistant plants of both species were grown under non-optimal temperature conditions. The results suggest that the resistance mechanism against glyphosate damage is less efficient at optimal growing temperatures. Conclusion: It is possible to increase the control of glyphosate-resistant S. halepense and L. rigidum populations by treatment with glyphosate during growing conditions at suboptimal low temperatures. Conversely, glyphosate failure will continue to occur on glyphosate-resistant populations treated during periods of higher temperatures.","2013","2015-06-01 20:41:43","2015-06-02 02:03:05","","228-232","","2","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Herbicide resistance management; Reduced glyphosate translocation; Resistance factor; Resistance mechanism; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; Temperature effect; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","glyphosate; Lolium rigidum; Sorghum halepense; temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E.","Grasses and grazing problems of East Africa.","World Crops","","","","","Digitaria abyssinica and D. scalarum are noxious weeds on arable, but are also excellent fodder grasses. Extensive pastures of D. scalarum, together with Trifolium cryptopodium, grow on the northern slopes of Mt. Elgon between 9000 and -9500 ft. Emgrostis mildbraedii should be a good grass on poor soils under erratic rainfall. D. scalarum is often found in association with Pennisetum purpureum, lying dormant where over-shaded, but becoming prominent when P. purpureum is burnt off. P. purpureum and P. clandestinum are outstanding grasses. Pennisetum haareri grows in pure stands in the swampy areas of the Bukoba district of Tanganyika, and probably in Southern Uganda. It grows well in wet, swampy places which are of little value at present. Pennisetum clandestinum grows in association with Trifolium semipilosum, T. subrotundum, T. usambarense, and T. rueppellianum, on the upper slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, providing a lush mixture of clover and grass when rested and not overgrazed. T. johnstonii is found in Kenya. Themeda triandra covers large areas of undulating country in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika; it grows in almost pure stands, never forming a close mat, and is one of the most valuable natural grasses in ranching areas. At least three varieties are known. In the open grass farming region Th. triandra is specially important. Where it is overgrazed, it tends to be replaced by tufted grasses such as Pennisetum schimperi and Sporobolus pyramidalis, which threaten to become dominant over large areas of E. Africa. Their presence favours erosion, since surface water run-off flows between their tufts. It is quoted that Th. triandra pastures can be improved by controlled burning of its over-growth just after the seeding stage. Wiry and tufted grasses are difficult to eradicate; good grazing management alone is not sufficient. In marginal country, where rainfall is scanty and badly distributed, Chloris gayana has made good, palatable, and persistant leys. It has been successfully established when sown under sorghum and maize. Melinis minutiflora will sometimes make a good ley, but is unreliable; the Channia ecotype promised well, however. In the hot lowland countries, the indigenous grasses are often bitter and unpalatable. Kavirondo perennial sorghum was discovered and developed in East Africa. It was derived from a single plant, considered to be a natural hybrid between native grain sorghum and the wild Sorghum verticilliflorum. Drilled 2 ft. apart at 10 lb. per acre, it yields up to 16 tons of green material per ac. after 18 weeks. When allowed to mature for seed, it yields up to 350 lb. seed per acre which, although not suitable for human consumption, can be fed to stock. In Kenya, an improved Kavirondo sorghum, R 2S 42, was obtained by selection and selfing; it resembles the edible sorghum. In the highland areas, Bromus marginatus does well if the rainfall is less than 40 in. Indigenous clovers will grow in association with B. marginatus. Cynodon dactylon and C. plectostachyum are both useful grasses. Two major problems which await solution are the control of encroaching bush on grassland, and the restoration of protective cover on overgrazed, eroded, and termite-damaged areas.-N.G.S.","1951","2015-06-01 17:44:48","2015-06-01 17:44:48","","8-26","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19510700726","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the reported elevation in milk rumenic acid (RA) concentration associated with G compared with ZG and GS, and to identify the important variables contributing to the milk RA response. Grazing animals were offered 20 kg of dry matter/cow per day; indoor animals were offered ad libitum grass or silage. A concentrate at a rate of 3 kg/d was also offered to all cows. Rumen, plasma, and milk samples were collected in the third week of each period. Data were analyzed by the MIXED procedure of SAS. Dry matter intakes were less for GS with no difference between G and ZG. Milk yield was greater for G than for ZG or GS. Milk fat and protein contents were less for GS with no difference between G and ZG. The combined intake (g/d) of linoleic and linolenic (18:3n-3) acids was different across the treatments (G: 433; ZG: 327; and GS: 164). Rumen pH was less for G with no difference between ZG and GS. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ammonia nitrogen in rumens were not different across the treatments. Wet rumen fill was less for G with no difference between ZG and GS. Vaccenic acid concentrations were different across the treatments in rumen (G: 12.30%, ZG: 9.31%, and GS: 4.21%); plasma (G: 2.18%, ZG: 1.47%, and GS: 0.66%) and milk (G: 4.73%, ZG: 3.49%, and GS: 0.99%). Milk RA concentrations were greater for G (2.07%) than for ZG (1.38%) and GS (0.54%). Milk desaturase index based on the ratio cis-9-14:1/14:0 was not different across the treatments. Milk RA yield per 100 g of linoleic acid and linolenic acid intake (efficiency) was 2.23, 1.50, and 0.62 g in G, ZG, and GS, respectively, suggesting that G cows were more efficient than ZG and GS cows in milk RA production. Stepwise regression analysis of a group of variables revealed that plasma vaccenic acid accounted for 95% of the variation in milk RA production. Milk desaturase index did not enter into the model. Overall findings suggest that substrate intake influenced milk RA production but it was not the only factor involved. There were differences in efficiency of milk RA production, which appears to depend on the factors regulating ruminal vaccenic acid production and its supply to the mammary tissue.","August 2009","2015-06-01 19:32:57","2015-06-02 00:29:29","","3874-3893","","8","92","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; conjugated linoleic acid; grazing; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); rumenic acid; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass""); vaccenic acid","ad libitum feeding; conjugated linoleic acid; cow feeding; dairy cows; dietary fat; dry matter intake; fatty acid composition; grass silage; grazing; linoleic acid; linolenic acid; lipid metabolism; mammary glands; milk composition; milk fat; milk fat percentage; milk protein percentage; milk yield; pH; rumen fermentation; rumen fluids; vaccenic acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As rhinitis often precedes asthma it is possible that effective treatment of allergic rhinitis may reduce asthma progression. The aim of our study is to investigate history of allergic rhinitis as a risk factor for asthma and the potential effect of allergen immunotherapy in attenuating the incidence of asthma. Hospital-referred non-asthmatic adults, aged 18-40 years between 1990 and 1991, were retrospectively followed up until January and April 2000. At the end of follow up, available subjects were clinically examined for asthma diagnosis and history of allergen specific immunotherapy, second-hand smoking and the presence of pets in the household. A total of 436 non-asthmatic adults (332 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 104 with no allergic rhinitis nor history of atopy) were available for final analyses. The highest OR (odds ratio) associated with a diagnosis of asthma at the end of follow-up was for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis at baseline (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.1-20.0 in the model containing the covariates of rhinitis diagnosis, sex, second-hand smoke exposure, presence of pets at home, family history of allergic disorders, sensitization to Parietaria judaica; grass pollen; house dust mites; Olea europea: orchard; perennial rye; and cat allergens). Female sex, sensitization to Parietaria judaica and the presence of pets in the home were also significantly predictive of new onset asthma in the same model. Treatment with allergen immunotherapy was significantly and inversely related to the development of new onset asthma (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.86). In the present study we found that allergic rhinitis is an important independent risk factor for asthma. Moreover, treatment with allergen immunotherapy lowers the risk of the development of new asthma cases in adults with allergic rhinitis.","DEC 28  2005","2015-06-01 17:30:19","2015-06-01 17:30:19","","153","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000234891900001","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175–299 g-C m−2 yr−1 as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m−2 yr−1 as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84–283 g-C m−2 yr−1 of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5–6.6 g-C m−2 yr−1 as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45–95% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence.","March 15, 2012","2015-06-01 19:23:37","2015-06-01 19:23:37","","1-18","","0","150","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon flux; Eddy covariance; Evaporation; Peatland; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an initial study fresh soil was mixed with combinations of two inorganic S levels (0 and 10 microgram S g(-1) soil) and three plant residues (wheat straw, perennial ryegrass and oilseed rape) and followed over 32 days of incubation. As 35S recovery was inadequate prior to day 2 and re-mineralisation of immobilised 35S occurred after day 8 thereby invalidating the method, estimates of gross S transformation rates should be based on data sampled between days 2 and 8. In the main experiment 16 plant residues with ranges in S contents of 0.08-0.81%, C/S ratios of 50-604 and lignin content of 0.9-10.8 were mixed with soil and carrier-free 35S label. Net turnover rates varied from 58% of S in Persian clover being immobilised to 76% of S in winter cress being mineralised within 5 days of incubation. Gross S mineralisation varied from 0.9-14.9 microgram S g(-1) soil d(-1), whereas gross immobilisation only varied from 0.5 to 3.1 microgram S g(-1) d(-1). Gross S immobilisation was strongly correlated to the C/S ratio of the plant material (P<0.001), whereas gross S mineralisation showed a weaker, but still significant, correlation with lignin content (P<0.05). The results indicate that immobilisation may predominantly have been a biological process in response to carbon addition while early mineralisation may have been dominated by the biochemical hydrolysis of organic sulphates in the residues. If attention is paid to the various constraints and limitations, isotopic pool dilution using 35S offers a tool that may prove valuable in understanding and modelling soil S turnover.","December 2005","2015-06-01 19:59:24","2015-06-02 00:29:57","","2216-2224","","12","37","","Soil biology & biochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","35S pool dilution; AGRICOLA; Gross S turnover; Immobilisation; Mineralisation; MIT; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Plant residues; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; Sulphur; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","equations; immobilization in soil; isotope dilution technique; mineralization; plant residues; soil amendments; soil nutrient dynamics; sulfur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parameters monitored included soil moisture, soil organic carbon and nitrogen, soil mineral nitrogen, cover crop biomass and nutrient content, and tree morphological and nutrient characteristics. Results obtained indicated that the species selection affected the amount of green manure produced and its total nitrogen and phosphorus content. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen were stable in the upper soil profile due to the relatively small quantity added with the cropping system compared to the total stock of soil C and N. Mineral nitrogen decreased over the season due to the synchrony of cover crop decomposition, mineralization and nutrient uptake by trees in the upper profile. Species selection and management practices did not affect tree relative height growth and 100-needles weight, but management practices affected relative diameter growth, indicating competition for soil moisture. Tree foliar nutrient concentrations were not significantly affected by cover species, but were much lower in some of the management practices, suggesting competition for nutrients. We conclude that careful management should be used to capitalize on cover crop benefits and avoid competition for soil nutrients and moisture.","2010","2015-06-01 20:28:58","2015-06-02 00:31:07","","269-277","","6","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Cropping system; Green manure; Plantation management; Scopus; search.rye; Soil moisture; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic nitrogen; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N). Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better access to water. On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the shading by the taller pigeonpea. Measurements of root profile of pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved.

There were significant effects of site, treatment, and year on both aboveground biomass and seed yield. On average, bundleflower monoculture produced the greatest aboveground biomass, although the three-species mixture produced the peak biomass (814 g/m(2)) in any given year. Among treatments, Illinois bundleflower monoculture yielded the most seed (maximum = 122 g/m(2)). Overall, biomass and seed yield were higher at the more fertile Site 1, but species differed in their dependence on soil fertility. Among species, bundleflower performed fairly independently of soil fertility, wildrye grew poorly on the less fertile soil, and gamagrass persisted at both sites although it grew less well at Site 2,.

In general, the overyielding effect appeared stronger at Site 2 than at Site 1, with seed yield RYT appearing to increase with time at Site 2. The results show that the seed yield of perennials can be high, and that some species can persist in mixture for several years. The data for 5 yrs point to the need to follow long-term patterns of yield and interspecific interactions within perennial grain polycultures in order to maintain species diversity and to make reasonable predictions.","1998","2015-06-01 20:25:00","2015-06-02 02:02:55","","1-11","","1-2","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Desmanthus illinoensis; Leymus racemosus; Perennial grains; perennial W/1 grain; Polyculture; Relative yield total; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; Soil; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Tripsacum dactyloides; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), but not relative leaf area expansion rate (RLAER), were drastically reduced in n plants in both species and that root length was reduced by 50% in Desmodium severely stressed T2 plants. The activity of acid phosphatase secreted by the roots in vivo increased under P deficiency in both species. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) of the secreted enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk linear plots were different for the enzyme from T1 or T2 plants in both species. The numerical value of the Km for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-P provided a means of comparing the enzyme from high- or low-P plants. and it is suggested that Km, enzyme activity (Vmax), total leaf area and RGR (during exponential growth), may be used as physiological indicators to differentiate plants grown under P deficiency or sufficiency","1996","2015-06-01 17:24:39","2015-06-02 00:38:14","","1971-1993","","5-8","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1996UJ93500076","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); TX (perennial N1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon#pea"")); WOS","acidification; acid phosphatase; Cajanus cajan; Desmodium tortuosum; dry matter accumulation; enzyme activity; leaf area; length; net assimilation rate; nutrient availability; nutrient deficiencies; phosphorus; plant nutrition; rhizosphere; roots; seedling growth; soil fertility; soil pH; species differences; weight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The growth-rates of diploid hybrids resembled that of rye grass while those of the triploids were similar to that of meadow fescue. Experiments on plants grown singly and in competition showed that fescue was adversely affected by low temperature and rye grass by low light and also by the reduced nutrient supply arising from competition.The persistence of the sterile hybrids is explained by their recurrent formation coupled with greater longevity and vegetative spread, arising from growth characteristics intermediate between those of their parents. The persistence of rye grass and the disappearance of fescue when periodically grazed appear to result from the earlier growth and more rapid rate of tillering of the former. However, rye grass has fewer and smaller meristems available for regrowth if allowed to grow until anthesis, and under these conditions fescue dominates. The intermediate growth characters of the hybrids allow them to survive spring grazing more readily than meadow fescue and cutting for hay more readily than rye grass.","1961","2015-06-01 20:32:56","2015-06-02 02:02:49","","330-340","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the morphology and phenology of the chosen bromes (Bromus tectorum, Bromus sterilis and Bromus squarrosus) are highly similar, we measured complex traits often associated with invasive success: phenotypic plasticity, competitive ability and generalist-specialist character. We performed common-garden experiments, community- and landscape-level surveys in areas of co-occurrence in Central Europe (Hungary) that could have served as donor region for American introductions. According to our results, the three bromes are unequally equipped with trait that could enhance invasiveness. B. tectorum possesses several traits that may be especially relevant: it has uniquely high phenotypic plasticity, as demonstrated in a nitrogen addition experiment, and it is a habitat generalist, thriving in a wide range of habitats, from semi-natural to degraded ones, and having the widest co-occurrence based niche-breadth. The strength of B. sterilis lies in its ability to use resources unexploited by other species. It can become dominant, but only in one non-natural habitat type, namely the understorey of the highly allelopathic stands of the invasive Robinia pseudoacacia. B. squarrosus is a habitat specialist with low competitive ability, always occurring with low coverage. This ranking of the species’ abilities can explain the current spreading success of the three bromes on the North American continent, and highlight the high potential of prehistoric invaders (European archaeophytes) to become invasive elsewhere.","September 2011","2015-06-01 19:24:15","2015-06-01 19:24:15","2011-10-01","441-448","","5","37","","Acta Oecologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Archaeophyte; Bromus squarrosus; Bromus sterilis; Bromus tectorum; Invasiveness; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Source area approach; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The elements Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Pb were measured in the soil and in rice plant parts — roots, shoots and grain — as well as in some weeds growing in the Sado banks, near the paddy fields. Results showed that the metal contents of paddy soils were similar to background concentrations, with the exception of Zn and Cu, which were above those concentrations and reached their highest levels at Vale de Guizo, the monitored station located furthest upstream in the Sado River. At some sites, plant roots accumulated relatively large amounts of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, but the shoot levels of these metals were within the normal range for rice plants. It is possible that varying, but significant, amounts of Fe associated with the roots were in the form of ferric hydroxide plaque covering their surfaces. Copper levels in the shoots of rice were below the normal contents cited for this plant in the literature. Metal levels of river sediments collected near Vale de Guizo seem to corroborate the possibility of some metal contamination in the Sado River, most probably derived from pyrites mining activity in the upper zone of the Sado basin.","January 1990","2015-06-01 19:23:41","2015-06-01 19:23:41","","89-97","","0","90","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STS critiques of determinism are needed in studies of agricultural technology. However, we contend that focusing on the agency of end users may mask the role of political-economic factors which influence technology developments and applications. This paper seeks to mesh STS insights with political-economic perspectives by accounting for relationships between availability of diverse technologies, variations in political-economic structures, and farmer interests and characteristics. We present the results of an analysis on the recent development of three wheat varieties: (a) a wheat variety that was modified genetically to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate, (b) wheat varieties with characteristics selected to serve specific markets, (c) and emerging research and development of perennial wheat varieties. Using data obtained through a survey of wheat growers in Washington State, we analyzed whether farmer interest in these three clusters of wheat varieties was associated with distinct individual characteristics and attitudes and whether those characteristics and attitudes are consistent with political economic structures. Although our analysis did not allow us to assess the degree of direct influence that farmers have on the technological development trajectory for these types of wheat, we were able to document variation in technological alternatives and farmer characteristics related to different political-economic trends.","JUN  2011","2015-06-01 17:46:08","2015-06-02 00:39:45","","213-224","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000290667800005","","","","Farming; Genetically modified; Niche marketing; Participatory; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; Technological determinism; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found by nonparametric and parametric analyses that immune responsiveness to Lol p III was significantly associated with HLA-DR3 and DR5. No association was found between any DQ type and immune responsiveness to Lol p III. Geometric mean IgE or IgG Ab levels to Lol p III were not different between B8+, DR3+ subjects and B8-, DR3+ subjects, showing that HLA-B8 had no influence on the association. Lol p III IgG Ab data obtained on subjects after grass antigen immunotherapy showed that 100% of DR3 subjects and 100% of DR5 subjects were Ab+. A comparison of all the available protein sequences of DRB gene products showed that the first hypervariable region of DR3 and DR5 (and DRw6), and no other region, contains the sequence Glu9TyrSerThrSer13.

After five panning cycles on recombinant Lol pII immunotubes, phage binders were isolated and the antibody fragments expressed as soluble Fab molecules in the Escherichia coli periplasm. The DNA sequencing of the clones producing antibodies with the highest binding activity showed three of them to be identical, while one differed by two amino acid substitutions in the heavy chain. The antibody fragments were produced in milligram amounts, affinity-purified and further characterized. They bound the natural allergen as well as the recombinant one, with no cross-reactivity with other allergens contained in the pollen extract of L. perenne. One antibody bound the allergen with Kd=2.63 × 10−9 M, as demonstrated by the surface plasmon resonance technique, and was able to compete with a fraction of serum IgE. Epitope mapping using synthetic peptides revealed that antigenic domains, located between amino acids 39 and 51 of Lol pII, are recognized by Fab and polyclonal IgE from sera of allergic donors. The Fab fragments inhibited the binding of serum IgE to the allergen. In vitro experiments on whole blood from allergic subjects showed that recombinant Fab fragments had a blocking activity on histamine release from cells challenged with recombinant Lol pII allergen. Thus, serum IgE and recombinant Fab fragments recognize common epitopes, although they represent the outcome of different maturation and/or selection processes. Our molecular and functional findings altogether indicate that allergen-specific human antibodies may be useful for the characterization of the antigenic structure of allergens. We conclude that a phage library is a powerful source of anti-allergen human antibodies with high affinity and high specificity. Moreover, these molecules may be potentially innovative reagents for the treatment of atopic allergy.","September 1996","2015-06-01 19:32:45","2015-06-02 00:40:34","","1049-1058","","13","33","","Molecular Immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","allergen; anti-Lol pII; human Fab; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); phage library; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten new varieties of these Agropyron hybrids are now under extensive trial; No. 22850 is exceptionally resistant to lodging; the variety named Skorospelka (see ""Plant Breeding Abstracts"", Vol. XI, Abst. 943) is exceedingly early and drought resistant. Some of the newer selections have proved remarkably hardy and survived the very severe and snowless winter of 1938/39 during which quite half of the plants of the winter-hardy rye Omka were killed. The problem of selecting perennial wheats from the Triticum-Agropyron hybrids is regarded now as almost solved. A promising perennial rye has also been produced by crossing Agropyron with rye; it is hoped in this way to produce a rye with higher gluten content.","1941","2015-06-01 17:38:51","2015-06-02 00:40:38","","10-19","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19421600975","","","","search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tester DAMS-1 was also a good general combiner for primary branches/plant-1 and per cent pod setting. The estimates of sigma2gca and sigma2sca suggested partial dominance of additive genetic action for number of pods/plant-1. While for days to flowering, days to maturity, plant height, number of primary branches/plant-1, per cent pod setting, harvest index and seed yield/plant-1 over dominance with non additive genetic variance was observed. The contribution of testers to the performance of crosses were found significant for seed yield/plant-1 and yield attributing traits.

RAST inhibition experiments indicated in a more direct way the extent of cross-reactivity between grain extracts of wheat, rye, barley and oats. One baker had a history of more severe attacks of breathlessness following inhalation of rye flour compared with wheat flour.

The scores of percent ratooning germinability (PRG) and overwintering germinability (POG) were evaluated. The overwintering germination rate of axillary buds was scored to represent the overwintering germinability. Two significant QTLs (qPRG-4 and qPRG-7) on chromosomes 4 and 7 were detected and explained 8.3 and 7.2% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. Three significant QTLs (qPOG-2, qPOG-3 and qPOG-7) were identified and mapped on chromosomes 2, 3, and 7, respectively. These QTLs contributed 9.6, 6.7, and 17.8% of phenotypic variations, respectively. A comparative analysis using SSR markers closely linked to the three QTLs for the overwintering revealed cold-tolerant individuals, which harbour the Glutinous rice 89-1 alleles at RM7110, RM250, RM418, and RM232, had a high percent overwintering germinability, while cold-sensitive individuals, which carry Shuhui 527 alleles at these loci, had a low percent overwintering germinability in the F2 population of Shuhui 527/Glutinous rice 89-1.

Characters like pink and waxy-coated stem, large number and area of green leaves, greater root and shoot yield, high-tillering and ratooning potential revealed positive correlation with EC50 values, while the dark green color of leaves, prolonged time taken to leaf rolling in saline solution and increased leaf senescence under salinity were negatively correlated.

Macrofossil remains of wild rice are uncommon on archaeological sites even where the plant is still common nearby. The association between documented human habitation and wild rice is explored with pollen records from associated wild rice wetlands. For this, reliable identification of wild rice pollen is essential. Three approaches are examined: (1) the pollen spectral signature (percentage and density of grass pollen), (2) coeval community pollen types, and (3) the pollen morphology (size and sculpturing) of wild rice versus other stand-forming wetland grasses. We report pollen spectra from a contemporary wild rice marsh and compare it with fossil pollen from Cootes Paradise, a wetland at the western end of Lake Ontario. The pollen signature from the modern wild rice wetlands was similar to that of the fossil site, but this correspondence does not confirm that the fossil grass pollen is wild rice. Wild rice pollen is separable by size from that of all the stand-forming wetland grasses examined, but the fossil pollen from Bull's Point is not the same size as that of modern wild rice. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), however, indicates that wild rice pollen is identifiable by its sculpturing and that the fossil pollen has an identical micromorphology.","April 2004","2015-06-01 19:23:39","2015-06-01 19:23:39","","411-421","","4","31","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Great Lakes region; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Plant foraging; Pollen micromorphology; Pollen signature; Princess Point complex; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Wild rice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this experiment was to determine the distribution of genetic variation within and between Illinois bundleflower accessions by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Semi-automated fluorescence-based AFLP analysis was performed on three individuals from each of 50 accessions. We identified 222 markers, 159 of which were polymorphic. Within-accession diversity was low (Hs = 0.013) compared with total gene diversity (HT = 0.086). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 83% of the molecular variance was explained by two major clusters, supporting a previous phenotypic study that suggested the existence of two distinct races of Illinois bundleflower. The less commonly occurring of the two races contained greater genetic diversity and originated from a localized region in the south central USA. The collection of more accessions from throughout the USA and focused on the Southeast would likely increase the genetic variation available to plant breeders.","2003","2015-06-01 20:24:46","2015-06-02 00:41:45","","402-408","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (perennial N1 grain); WOS","amplified fragment length polymorphism; Desmanthus; Desmanthus illinoensis; genetic markers; genetic techniques and protocols; genetic variation; geographical variation; germplasm; nitrogen fixation; pastures; plant genetic resources; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both myeloma antidextrans were α-D(1→6) specific and precipitated strongly with a synthetic, linear dextran molecular weight 36,500, and with other dextrans. The two myeloma antidextrans differed with respect to their relative reactivities with dextrans containing various proportions of α-D-(1→6), α-D-(1→4)-like, and α-D-(1→3)-like linkages. In inhibition assays, the two antidextran myeloma proteins behaved differently from each other, from α-D-(1→6)-specific BALB/c myeloma antidextrans, and from the human antidextrans previously studied. Isomalto-oligosaccharides IM3, IM4, and IM5 were all equal in inhibitory power but were only about 60% as potent as IM6 and IM7, which also inhibited equally on a molar basis. Although precipitation with linear dextran suggests that both may have groove-type sites, as previously inferred for QUPC 52, the size of their combining sites is uncertain. It is not clear whether the sites are only as big as three glucose residues with the increased inhibition by six and seven glucose residues being attributable to partial bivalence and to their ability to combine in several ways along the chain, or whether the site is as big as six glucose residues with the increment in binding by the fourth and fifth glucose residues being minimal and the sixth contributing considerable additional binding-energy. The fructan-specific myeloma protein did not react with inulin, but reacted with many levans and with perennial rye-grass levan containing only β-D-(2→6) links. The levan-antilevan reaction was not inhibited by β-D-(2→1)-linked oligosaccharides.

Alleyways were grown with upland rice Oryza sativa L. and fertilised with G. sepium green manure or C. spectabilis mulch (or in combination) and assessed for weed and insect pest suppression. Mulch reduced weed biomass which was mostly composed of grasses on infertile soil. Green manure favoured broadleaf weeds and increased weed biomass reducing the effect of mulching. Greater weed suppression may be achieved. Improvement in soil fertility increased the crops’ competitiveness against weeds by concentrating it to crop furrows. Greater crop nutrition from hedgerow biomass resulted in increases of rice seedling maggot Atherigona oryzae Malloch and stem borer (mainly Sesamia inferens (Walker)) damage and white grub (mainly Holotrichia mindanaoana Brenske and Leucopholis irrorata (Chevrolat)) larval densities over the control. Terrace formation reduced white grub densities the first year. The trend reversed in the second year as shade from the hedgerows and mulch probably favoured survival of white grub larvae by reducing soil temperature and increasing soil moisture. Despite higher insect pest densities, the moderate tillering UPLRi5 tolerated weeds and insect pest damage to produce higher yields in the biomass treatments than the control.

Farmers tend to maximize economic output of farming activities that may not necessarily coincide with the optimal use of resources from an ecological perspective. However, improving resource use efficiencies at the regional level is important for society at large. Efficiencies can be enhanced by well-chosen combinations of resource efficient technologies at the farm level and policy interventions at the regional level, thereby obtaining a balance between the objectives of both farmers and society. Rice-based farms in Tamil Nadu, India, were grouped into four farm types based on their biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. Crop and farm level resource use efficiencies of water, labour, capital and nutrients were quantified on three representative farms per farm type. The four farm types differed in water, labour and nutrient productivity and profitability both at crop and farm level. Water productivity was poor on Farm Types 1, 2 and 3 compared with Farm Type 4 due to the open access to the commonly available canal water on the first types. Labour productivity was highest on Farm Type 2 due to more family labour use and lowest on Farm Type 3 due to the small operational holding. Farm Types 1 and 2 were most profitable and Farm Types 3 and 4 were least profitable – directly related to the resource endowments. Farm Type 3 was least efficient in all the resources considered, emphasizing the negative effect of low resource endowments. Possible policy interventions in order to improve the resource use efficiencies and their effect on the farmer livelihoods are discussed. Government policy interventions may influence the farm resource use efficiencies through the adoption of resource efficient technologies. However, an identical set of policy interventions cannot be applicable to all farm types since current resource use efficiencies and adaptability of these farm types for change in policies differed substantially.","March 2012","2015-06-01 19:23:57","2015-06-01 19:23:57","","41-52","","1–2","59","","NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Farmer livelihoods; Farm typology; Labour productivity; Nutrient productivity; Partial nutrient balance; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Profitability; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Water productivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With projected warming of approximately 0.8°C by 2030 and by 1.4-2.7°C by 2070 (emissions dependent), and most climate models indicating reduced rainfall for the Victorian region (median of model results projecting a reduction of 4% by 2030 and 6%-11% by 2070; emissions dependent), a range of sector-specific impacts could result. Increases in extreme events, such as heatwaves (e.g. for Mildura, days >35°C could nearly double from 32 to 59 annually by 2070), bushfires and drought, as well as an increased chance of extreme rainfall are all anticipated. Increasing frequencies of extreme events have the potential to affect agricultural production more than changes to the mean climate. For example, the exceptional heatwave that occurred in south-eastern Australia during January and February 2009 resulted in unprecedented impacts, with significant heat-stress related crop losses reported at many sites. Flooding in 2011 was also very costly to Victorian farmers with many crops being lost in the floodwatcrs and reduced agricultural production costing an estimated Au$500-600 million. Responses to climate variability already practised by the farming sector will inform some adaptation options that will assist farmers to cope in an increasingly challenging environment. As well as taking advantage of their underlying resilience, initiatives aimed at increasing the adaptive capacity of farmers arc being implemented at many levels in agricultural communities.","2013","2015-06-01 17:17:52","2015-06-01 17:17:52","","24-30","","1/2","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20143028650","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a kind of green waste (perennial ryegrass) was used as carbon source to adjust carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) in WAS to enhance SCFAs production. The effects of different C/N ratio ranging from 26/1 to 7/1 on SCFAs production and cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin consumption were investigated in detail. It was observed that the maximal SCFAs yield was 368.71 g COD per kilogram of total solids (TS) at C/N 20/1 with fermentation time of 12 d, which was, respectively, over 4 and 12 times than that at C/N 26/1 (sole perennial ryegrass) and C/N 7/1 (sole WAS). Meanwhile, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin consumptions were 109.12, 148.74, 20.90 g COD/kg TS, respectively, at C/N 20/1 with fermentation time of 12 d. The analysis of the composition of SCFAs showed that acetic acid ranked the first among other acids from C/N ratio of 26/1 to 18/1, whereas propionic acid was the dominant product from C/N ratio of 16/1 to 7/1. Because the results of this study were different from previous studies of SCFAs generation, the mechanism of improved SCFAs at C/N ratio of 20/1 by perennial ryegrass addition was investigated. Results showed that as soluble COD, soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate increased, more substrates were available for SCFAs production at C/N ratio of 20/1. In addition, with the drop of pH to 4.82, methane generating was inhabitant and the SCFAs production was therefore significantly enhanced. Additionally, the mechanism of improved SCFAs generation was analyzed from the view of enzyme activities and microbial community. The experiments revealed that at C/N ratio of 20/1 the activities of enzymes were the highest comparing with other C/N ratios and lignin was the rate-limiting steps in WAS anaerobic digestion by perennial ryegrass addition. The 16S rRNA gene clone library demonstrated that Clostridia, Spirochaetes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant microbial community at C/N ratio of 20/1.","September 1, 2013","2015-06-01 19:21:41","2015-06-01 19:21:41","","4576-4584","","13","47","","Water Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anaerobic digestion; C/N ratio; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Short-chain fatty acids; SPV; Waste activated sludge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental results indicated that the optimal time of cutting the stubble was 2 to 12 days after harvest of the spring crop. Delayed cutting resulted in extended occupation of crop in the field and yield reduction due to low temperature during the grain-filling period. The height of cutting the stubble should be low or close to the ground level. Tillage at 10 days after stubble cutting to cover the ridge with 10-cm soil was also beneficial to the yield performance of ratoon sorghum. For the method of N fertilization, 50% of fertilizer as basal application could be applied at 1 day before stubble cutting, and 25% each could be top-dressed at 20 and 40 days after stubble cutting. An alternative was to apply 50% each of N fertilizer at 10 and 40 days after stubble cutting. However, the former method was recommended as it provided N for both early vegetative growth and panicle development of the ratoon sorghum.","1991","2015-06-01 19:09:54","2015-06-02 00:42:16","","13-21","","31","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199396046949","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential to manage these diseases through intercropping eastern gamagrass with other, non-host perennial species was examined by monitoring incidence and severity on eastern gamagrass within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with wildrye (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tsvelev), two-species mixtures with Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacM., Leguminosae), and three-species mixtures with wildrye and Illinois bundleflower at two sites in Kansas, USA, from 1991 to 1995. Wildrye and bundleflower, which are also potential grain crops, are not reported to be hosts of the viruses. At Site 1, in 1991 and 1992, disease was generally less frequent and less severe in biculture with bundleflower and in the three-species mixture than in monoculture or the biculture with wildrye. No treatment effects were observed at Site 2. Disease severity was negatively correlated with plant size and seed yield at Site 1. Seed yield per plant was generally higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The results suggest polyculture may contribute to the management of aphid-borne plant disease within plantings of perennial grains.","October 1996","2015-06-01 19:18:32","2015-06-02 00:42:40","","139-147","","3","59","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aphid vector; Eastern gamagrass; Mosaic virus; Perennial grains; perennial W/1 grain; Plant disease; Polyculture; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Tripsacum dactyloides; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potato yields ranged from 9.3 t/ha in cv. Gigant to 18.0 t in Atlantic. In another trial in which potatoes cv. Berolina were given 12 fertilizer treatments ranging from a no-fertilizer control to the NPK rates of the 1st trial plus 12 t chicken manure/ha tuber yields were 11.1-15.4 t/ha with no significant differences. In a 3rd trial in the same season using potatoes cv. Berolina and Cosima mulched with rice straw or unmulched, and planted on 13 or 28 Dec. or 12 Jan., tuber yields were 3.8-15.6 t/ha. Yields were higher in Berolina than in Cosima, increased by mulching, and greatly decreased by planting on 12 Jan. Rice cv. IR66 grown in May-Aug. 1989 following lowland potatoes was given 0, 30, 60 or 90 kg N/ha. Without applied N, residual fertility after 3 years of rice-rice-potato cropping produced a grain yield of 4.11 t/ha. When rice was transplanted rather than established as a wet season crop the yield without N was 5.04 t. N increased the yield of wet season rice to 5.03 t, advanced the flowering date, and increased lodging. All treatments were given 30 kg N/ha 2 weeks before maturity of the main crop, to provide N for the following ratoon crop; the ratoon crop was also given 2 later applications of 30 kg N. The ratoon crop yielded 2.90-3.16 t/ha. Rice cv. IR66 was also sown following potatoes given the 12 fertilizer treatments outlined above. Main crop rice yields were 2.76-4.21 t/ha, and ratoon crop yields 1.87-2.49 t. The highest total yield was produced by rice following 220-70-70 kg NPK + 12 t chicken manure/ha. It was concluded that rice and potatoes could be profitably grown in rotation, that chicken manure applied to potatoes improved soil fertility for a following rice crop, and that wet season rice following potatoes could be profitably ratoon cropped.","1990","2015-06-01 18:32:13","2015-06-01 18:32:13","","85-98","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19920758111","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The alterations in rainfall patterns can have considerable feedback on solar radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture which can affect the ecosystem CO2 exchange. In this paper, we assessed the effects of the ENSO events (2008–mid 2010) on the seasonal climate conditions and determined how it affected the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and net ecosystem production (NEP) of two contrasting rice environments: flooded and non-flooded. The 2008 dry season (DS) was under a La Niña event while the 2008 wet season (WS) was a neutral one with strong tropical cyclones associated during the wet season. The 2009DS was also La Niña while the 2009WS was El Niño; however, the northern part of the Philippines experienced strong tropical cyclones. The 2010DS was under an El Niño event. The La Niña in 2008DS resulted in about 15% lower solar radiation (SR), 0.3 °C lower air temperature (Ta) and 60% higher precipitation compared to the 28-year climate normal patterns. Both flooded and non-flooded rice fields had lower NEP in 2008 DS (164 and 14 g C m−2, respectively) than in 2008 WS (295 and 82 g C m−2, respectively) because the climate anomaly resulted in SR – driven decrease in GPP. The La Niña in 2009DS even resulted in 0.2 °C lower air temperature and 40% more precipitation than the 2008DS La Niña. This cooler temperature resulted in lower Re in flooded rice fields while the higher precipitation resulted in higher GPP in non-flooded fields since the climate was favorable for the growth of the aerobic rice, the ratoon crops and the weeds. This climate anomaly benefitted both flooded and non-flooded rice fields by increasing NEP (351 and 218 g C m−2, respectively). However, NEP decreased in 2009WS in both flooded and non-flooded rice fields (225 and 39 g C m−2, respectively) due to the devastating effects of the strong tropical cyclones that hit the northern part of the Philippines. On the other hand, the El Niño event during 2010DS resulted in about 6% higher solar radiation, 0.4 °C higher air temperature and 67% lower precipitation than the 28-year climate normal pattern. The NEP of flooded and non-flooded rice fields were closely similar at 187 and 174 g C m−2, respectively. This climate anomaly resulted in Ta – driven increase in Re, as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) – driven decrease in GPP in flooded rice fields. The GPP and Re in non-flooded rice fields were less sensitive to higher VPD and higher Ta, respectively. It appears that the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in non-flooded rice field was less sensitive to an El Niño event.","August 12, 2012","2015-06-01 19:38:36","2015-06-02 00:43:29","","80-94","","0","134","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Ecosystem CO2 exchanges; El Niño; ENSO; Flooded rice fields; La Niña; Non-flooded rice fields; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate; drought; dry season; ecosystem respiration; ecosystems; El Nino; floods; La Nina; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; paddies; Philippines; primary productivity; rain; ratooning; rice; seasonal variation; soil water; solar radiation; typhoons; vapor pressure; wet season","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All of the ten maintainer lines, five restorer lines and three thermo-sensitive genic male sterile lines used in the study could pollinate Yuetai A and Yuetai B to produce F1 plants, directly or indirectly resulting in Rf-gene drifting into Yuetai A and generating ‘iso-cytoplasm restoring-generations’. Furthermore, high outcrossing rate and similar heading date of Yuetai A with many varieties used in rice production might easily result in the biological contamination.

The highest soil moisture was observed in plots under perennial pigeon pea grown as hedge row with ragi or kodo millet. Results also showed that the duration of the growing period of the preceding crop was another important factor influencing the moisture status of the soil at the time of lentil sowing. Comparatively lower soil moisture was recorded at lower depths when perennial pigeon pea was combined with lentil. Lowest lentil yield was recorded when grown with the pigeon pea hedge row.

The study reported in this paper investigated the influence of sward height on diet selection by horses grazing perennial rye-grass swards. The study comprised two experiments. In Experiment 1, perennial rye-grass paddocks were mown to four sward heights (heights: 3.5, 4.5, 7.5 and 15 cm) to create a patchy environment. Within each paddock one horse grazed for a period of 1 h during which residence time, number of bites and frequency of visits per patch were recorded. This was replicated with all seven horses used in the experiment. The same experiment was repeated in Experiment 2, but without mowing the field and allowing 1 week of re-growth for each paddock. During both experiments horses entered equally often but resided significantly longer on patches with long grass (15 cm) than on those with short grass (below 4.5 cm; P < 0.05). Grazing time and number of bites on a patch were highly correlated. The number of bites on patches with the highest sward height was greater than that on short patches (P < 0.05). Horses behaved as selective grazers, feeding mainly on grass taller than 7 cm. In Experiment 2, re-growth of the sward reduced the difference in sward height between the patches. Time spent per patch and total numbers of bites taken were less affected by sward height than in Experiment 1. It is suggested that horses behaved as energy maximisers (residing longer periods on patches and increasing number of bites taken). These data complement previous findings that bite dimension and bite mass increase with increasing sward height. When grazing, a horse rarely resided on a preferred patch for a long duration of time (maximum 305 s, median 79 s), but moved on after a few minutes. They sampled their environment continuously, but almost exclusively returned to long patches for feeding.","2005","2015-06-01 20:29:50","2015-06-02 02:02:11","","49-63","","1","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Diet selection; Energy maximisation; Exploration; Grazing behaviour; Horses; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; Selective grazing; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In other respects, grazed grass compared with eating cut grass did not affect lipogenic enzyme activities but decreased plasma leptin concentrations in the older steers and increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids and glucose concentrations without affecting adipose tissue weight and adipose cell size.","October 2007","2015-06-01 19:51:31","2015-06-01 19:51:31","","1263-1271","","9","1","","Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.rye; SPV; TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","adipose tissue; cattle feeding; diet; grazing; leptin; lipogenesis; steers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an Orthic Brown Chernozem in southwestern Saskatchewan, 7 years of no-till cereal-fallow, imposed on a long-term tillage fallow-wheat rotation soil, resulted in 0.1 Mg C ha(-1) more organic C mass in the sand + organic matter (OM) fraction of the 0- to 5-cm layer, whereas organic C associated with coarse silt (CS), fine silt (FS), coarse clay, and fine clay of 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers was less than that of the comparable tilled cereal-fallow system. Conversion of tilled fallow-wheat rotation soil to continuous cropping had a slight effect, whereas the organic C mass in all the size fractions was significantly increased in both 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers after alfalfa was introduced on tilled fallow-wheat as perennial forage for 10 years. In an Orthic Black Chernozem in east-central Saskatchewan that was cultivated and tilled using a cereal-fallow rotation for 62 years, organic C mass decreased in sand + OM, CS, and FS of 0- to 10-cm depth. Conversion of the tilled cereal-fallow cropland soil back to seeded grassland resulted in significantly more soil organic C in sand + OM fraction after 12 years of grass seed-down. The sand + OM fraction appears to be the size fraction pool initially most sensitive to adoption of management practices that are liable to sequester carbon in the soil.","2006","2015-06-01 20:43:19","2015-06-02 00:56:50","","338-344","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Organo-mineral complex; Particle-size fractionation; Scopus; search.wheat; Soil organic carbon; SPV; Tillage and rotation system; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","cropping systems; genetic soil types; particle size distribution; Saskatchewan; soil organic matter; soil texture; tillage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrated crop and livestock systems could help reverse this trend, therefore we examined the extent of use, the factors affecting use, and the potential for this system. The 1992 U.S. Department of Commerce data indicate that land in integrated systems is limited to less than 10% of the agricultural land. However, expiration of the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has created interest in integrated systems. Economists report that after CRP contracts expire, perennial forages and livestock systems may be the most profitable; however, a survey of growers indicates that 63% of all CRP acres will go back to crop production. Recent research in Wyoming shows that returning CRP land to production using wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow practices quickly degrades soil quality. A doubling of grazing fees would mean an 18% reduction in demand for public land, which could mean more options for CRP acreage after contract expiration. Exemplified successful systems are the Australia wheat-sheep (Ovis aries L.) system, perennial legume-wheat rotation in southern Alberta, grass community establishment on marginal Wyoming cropland, and an alternative (organic) farming system in South Dakota. Benefits include the opportunity for soil quality improvement, economic diversity, and pest control. However, tradition, lack of managerial experience, and necessary alteration in farm-ranch infrastructure may slow adoption. Generally, dryland integrated systems are agriclimatic zone specific, and represent a potential ecologically and economically sustainable form of agriculture. Scientists and producers have to identify and develop appropriate integrated systems that fit the natural resource base.","1996","2015-06-01 20:43:51","2015-06-02 00:57:32","","187-191","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","crop production; dryland farming; environmental impact; farming systems; farm management; land use; livestock production; soil fertility; soil organic matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of the experiments was to define the expediency of regular liming on low acidity soils and scientifically to validate liming periodicity and optimum rates of lime. The experiments were established on low acidity sandy loam soil, well supplied with mobile phosphorus and potassium. The crop rotation involved potatoes, barley with perennial grasses, perennial grasses of the firs and second year of usage, winter rye and spring wheat. Liming was carried out using limestone dust at rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 6.0 tonnes CaCO 3/ha. Periodicity of liming was annually, every second, third and sixth year. Rates applied for the crop rotation were 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 tonnes CaCO 3/ha. Results showed that during two crop rotations, further neutralization of low acidity soil reaction up to close to neutral or neutral does not render any significant influence on the yield of winter rye, barley, perennial grasses, or potatoes and on efficiency of crop rotation as a whole. Regular liming renders a positive influence on soil physicochemical properties. The lowest rates (1.5 tonnes/ha) allowed to maintain a stable acidity level and higher rates reduce acidity close to neutral reaction, reduce hydrolytic acidity and increase amount of exchange bases. Regular liming reduced acidity not only in the arable layer, but also in the layers up to 40-cm depth.","2000","2015-06-01 17:31:23","2015-06-01 17:31:23","","62-72","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20013081045","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Root residues accumulated in field soil during asparagus growing for 10 years did not influence disease severity either. Inoculation of this soil with laboratory-prepared Foa after treatment at 65°C (30 min), at which the indigenous pathogen was killed but toxic substances present in asparagus root residues were left undamaged, led to the same disease severity as inoculation of similarly-treated fresh soil. On soil extract agar, aqueous root extracts of asparagus but not those of other crops retarded growth of 31 out of 112 fungal isolates from a range of taxa. Sensitive fungi included Gliocladium spp. and Trichoderma harzianum, but not Foa. Colonization of Foa-infested soil by Fusarium species was greatly enhanced by addition of root material from asparagus. Brussels sprouts, and chicory, but not by that from strawberry and perennial rye grass. As the fraction of Foa amongst the Fusarium population was small, it is concluded that competitive saprophytic ability of the pathogen is far less than that of the nonpathogenic Fusarium species. Fungistasis to Foa was not or was only slightly reduced in soils amended with root residues. In contrast to data reported in the literature, the present results do not suggest an appreciable increase of Foa root rot, or of the Foa population in soils, due to substances present in root residues.","1996","2015-06-01 20:31:12","2015-06-01 20:31:12","","809-822","","5","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

O. glaberrima was characterized by quick accumulation of photosynthate in the panicles. The simple,lf: morphological formation of rachis branching of O. glaberrima is thought to allow the smooth transportation of photosynthate from leaves to chaffs of a panicle and the early maturation. Such a feature as observed in O. glaberrima is regarded as an advantageous character for the seed production in annual plants. The photosynthate partition among different organs was monitored by the C-13 trace method. The culm base of O. sativa accumulated several-fold more C-13 than that of O. glaberrima.

Changes in larvae, pupae and parasitoid populations were monitored continuously on grain sorghum and ratoon crops during 1988-89 and 1989-90 (two growing seasons and a winter). Two peaks of moth flights occurred every year. The first flight, which resulted from the moths emerging from hibernating borers, peaked around the middle of November, and the second flight, usually larger, peaked at the end of February. B. fusca completed two generations on grain sorghum at Cedara. The first generation, which infested the early plants of the ratoon, peaked in the middle of January and the second generation peaked on the crops at the beginning of April. The fluctuation of borer numbers in the crops was synchronized with the instar distribution. An increase in the proportion of young larvae resulted in an increase in larval population, whereas an increase in the proportion of pupae resulted in a decline. Pupal parasitism by Procerochasmias nigromaculatus peaked at 100% during February-March and coincided with a general decline in the population and a high proportion of pupae. Larval parasitoids were active from January to the end of May, peaking at 75% on the ratoon during January. Peaks of larval parasitism usually lagged behind the peaks of larval population and occurred when populations started to decline. The most abundant larval parasitoid was Cotesia sesamiae, which was reared from about 87% of parasitized larvae.","1993","2015-06-01 19:09:24","2015-06-02 01:00:50","","543-553","","6","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199497137800","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A clearer understanding is important as atopy is increasing worldwide. Objective: To determine the influence of allergen skin test reactivity on observed mortality of a national cohort. Methods: Baseline health status and atopic status (allergen skin testing) was measured as part of the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), a representative sample of the US population, during the years 1976-80. Vital status and cause of death were assessed through December 31, 1992 for all examinees 30 years of age or older at baseline (n = 9252) as part of the NHANES II Mortality Study (NH2MS). The analytic sample contained 8179 men and women after excluding missing data. Allergen skin test reactivity was defined as weal ≥ 3 mm to one of eight 1:20 (w/v), 50% glycerinated (""No US Standard of Potency"") allergens licensed by the FDA: house dust, cat, dog, Alternaria, mixed giant/short ragweed, oak, perennial rye grass, and Bermuda grass. Survival analyses were conducted using multivariate adjusted Cox regression models to evaluate the association between atopy and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. Results. There was no association between allergen skin test reactivity and all cause mortality: 30-44 years RR = 1.07 (95% CI 0.63-1.84); 45-59 years RR = 1.10 (0.78-1.55); 60-75 years RR = 1.07 (0.91-1.25). Results were unchanged when cancer or heart disease mortality were examined separately. The presence or absence of allergic symptoms, using the flare to define skin test reactivity, eliminating deaths in the first 5 years of follow-up, or eliminating individuals with pre-existing conditions did not alter the findings. Conclusions. Atopy, defined by allergen skin test reactivity, with or without symptoms, is not a predictor of subsequent mortality.","2000","2015-06-01 20:30:24","2015-06-01 20:30:24","","1717-1723","","12","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Allergen skin test reactivity; atopy; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; Survival; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The possibility for producing sustainable grain harvests from marginal land areas is motivating research initiatives to integrate perennial grains into commercial cropping and food processing systems. In this study, the feruloylated arabinoxylans from intermediate wheat grass (Thinopyrum intermedium, IWG), a promising perennial grain candidate in agronomic screening studies, were investigated. Insoluble fiber isolated from IWG whole grain flour was subjected to either mildly acidic (50 mM TFA, 100 °C, 2 h) or enzymatic (Driselase) hydrolysis. The liberated feruloylated arabinoxylan oligosaccharides were concentrated with Amberlite XAD-2, separated with gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20, water), and purified with reversed-phase HPLC (C18, water-MeOH gradient). Thirteen feruloylated oligosaccharides were isolated (including eight structures described for the first time) and identified by LC-ESI-MS and NMR. Linkage-type analysis via methylation analysis, as well as the monosaccharide and phenolic acid profiles of the IWG insoluble fiber were also determined. IWG feruloylated arabinoxylans have a relatively simple structure with only short feruloylated side chains, a lower backbone substitution rate than annual rye and wheat varieties, and a moderate phenolic acid content.","April 30, 2015","2015-06-01 19:18:18","2015-06-01 21:58:59","","16-25","","0","407","","Carbohydrate Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arabinoxylans; Ferulic acid; Feruloylated oligosaccharides; Intermediate wheatgrass; perennial W/1 grain; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; Thinopyrum intermedium; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rural vote is considered the key to future political and economic stability. In 1976 Thailand is hoping to export 1.8 million tons of rice. The rice export tax has been reduced. In order to create an artificial demand for rice on the domestic market, the government has made it compulsory for exports to hold 250,000 tons in stock which costs them some Baht 20 million a month in holding costs. A further 50,000 tons has been ordered as part of the buffer stock scheme.

Forest policies that limit land use options may be able to halt forest change, if strongly enforced, but concurrently may also reduce livestock carrying capacity. This study explored the use of the spatially explicit FALLOW model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name ‘land-sparing’ but de facto combined with ‘land sharing’ approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers’ welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers’ welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples’ livelihoods and protecting environmental services.","September 15, 2012","2015-06-01 19:24:49","2015-06-01 19:24:49","","145-160","","0","159","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon stocks livelihood trade-offs; Land sharing versus sparing; Land use zoning; Model of ruminant cut-carry systems; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Scenario analysis; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is little evidence to test whether farmers need to own their land to conserve it, or if long-term leases are adequate. One way to infer whether or not different land tenure arrangements promote long-term management is through analyzing the types of crops planted on fields with different land tenure arrangements. Perennials, forage legumes, grasslands, and grain are all important parts of sustainable crop rotation in southwest British Columbia but provide little cash return in the year they are planted. Annual crops provide a high cash return but create soil conservation problems if they are planted too often. A comparison of fields with different land tenures showed that farmers who own their land plant more perennials, grain, and forage legumes than farmers who rent fields. Few differences were observed on fields with different lease lengths. This study leads to three overall conclusions. First, although results confirm the literature, and insecure land tenure is a real obstacle to long-term soil conservation, it is not possible to assume that long-term leases will substitute for land ownership. Second, it is possible to use relatively easy-to-gather data on crop history to assess the impact of tenure on farming. Third, intervening variables, in this case a program that pays farmers to plant grasslands, over-rides the effect of insecure land tenure and creates incentives for owner-operators and tenant farmers alike to use crop management that protects soil fertility in the long term.","2004","2015-06-01 20:24:44","2015-06-02 01:05:51","","73-79","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","British Columbia; Canada; Land tenure; Public goods; Scopus; search.grain; soil conservation; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in order to provide guidelines for environmental management at the regional scale and thus reverse the trend in degradation, transformations of natural remnants into anthropogenic land uses must be identified and quantified. This study examines LULC transitions from 1987 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2009 in two adjacent watersheds located in the Espinal, one of the least protected ecoregions of Argentina. We detected a 20% loss in ecosystems for the period analyzed and, in particular, 60% of native forests were lost. Changes were mainly driven by the expansion of croplands, which directly transformed wetlands and also acted as an underlying cause of the displacement of ranching activities, which in turn replaced Espinal forests. We developed a conceptual model of observed LULC changes for the study area, which we then complemented by proposing an alternative scenario that reconciles agriculture and biodiversity conservation. These results have implications for provincial land use planning and could contribute to the participatory processes demanded by the recent national legislation sanctioned for the protection of native forests.","December 1, 2013","2015-06-01 19:24:33","2015-06-01 19:24:33","","31-40","","0","181","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity conservation; Change detection; Cross-tabulation matrix; Deforestation; Natural remnants; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maize–cowpea sequential and pigeonpea/maize intercropping systems produced, respectively, 17 and 24% higher maize yields than continuous sole maize, but maize–pigeonpea rotation yielded only marginally better. Hedgerow intercropping did not increase maize yields because increased yields during the few high rainfall seasons did not compensate the yield losses in other seasons due to the competition of hedgerows for water with crop. Green manuring with gliricidia prunings increased maize production by 27%, but this technology was not economical because of high labour costs for production and application of prunings to the crop. The annual grain legume-based cropping systems were 32–49% more profitable than continuous sole maize, making them attractive to small farmers in semi-arid tropics. Both cowpea and pigeonpea were affected by pests and diseases, which indicated the need for integrated pest management for realising the potential benefits of these legume-based systems.","2000","2015-06-01 20:20:13","2015-06-02 01:06:36","","123-137","","2","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Cowpea; Gliricidia; Hedgerow intercropping; Kenya; Legumes; ""long duration"" W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR ""pigeonpea""); Maize; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; Semi-arid tropics; Soil fertility; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (""long duration"" W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (""long duration"" N1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon#pea""))","alley cropping; biomass; Cajanus cajan; crop residues; crop rotation; crop yield; economic analysis; farm income; Gliricidia sepium; green manures; integrated pest management; intercropping; Kenya; labor; plant competition; pruning; rain; semiarid zones; soil fertility; Vigna unguiculata; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the whole production chain, all cropping systems investigated contributed to the mitigation of GHG emissions (6.7-13.3 t CO2 eq/ha), with continuous maize revealing a carbon dioxide (CO2) saving potential of 55-61% compared with a fossil energy mix reference system. The current sustainability thresholds in terms of CO2 savings set by the EU Renewable Energy Directive could be met by all cropping systems (48-76%). Emissions from crop production had the largest impact on the mitigation effect (>= 50%) unless the biogas residue storage was not covered. The comparison of N fertilizer types showed less pronounced differences in GHG mitigation potential, whereas considerable site effects were observed.","DEC  2014","2015-06-01 17:45:30","2015-06-01 17:45:30","","S172-S181","","","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000347710700017","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Newly developed perennial cereals offer novel systems for addressing these questions. Our study makes a novel contribution by considering how life history differences affect photosynthetic physiology. Methods: In two linked field studies, we evaluated effects of life history and plant age on photosynthetic rates (A), and related biochemical, morphological, and water-relations traits, comparing 1- and 2-yr-old cohorts of perennial wheat, intermediate wheatgrass, and perennial rye to close annual relatives (wheat and rye). Key results: Photosynthetic rates (A) were 10-50% higher in perennial cereals compared to annuals. In wheatgrass, elevated A was associated with higher carboxylation (V-C), triose phosphate utilization (TPU) and electron transport rates (J), and higher leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll. Younger wheatgrass plants maintained higher A, TPU, J, and V-C than older plants did. Perennial wheat and rye differed from annual relatives in some but not all of these parameters. Differences in stomatal limitation were not involved, while differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)) became evident under drier conditions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that some perennial cereal species can maintain higher midseason A than their annual crop relatives. These changes are not fully explainable by increased access to soil water and may reflect trade-offs between allocation to reproduction and to resource acquisition. We also found evidence for age-related changes in photosynthetic physiology in a herbaceous perennial plant.","2013","2015-06-01 20:42:31","2015-06-02 01:07:05","","2468-2477","","12","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Age; Annual; Perennial; Photosynthesis; Poaceae; Scopus; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; Thinopyrum; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Triticum; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Whole plant; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","Linking phytoremediated pollutant removal to biomass economic opportunities","Biomass & Bioenergy","","0961-9534","10.1016/j.biombioe.2004.08.015","","Phytoremediation (phyto) strategies employ trees, shrubs, and/or grasses for treating contaminated air, soil, or water. These strategies include buffers, vegetation filters, in situ phytoremediation plantings, and percolation controlling vegetative caps. The design parameter that separates phytoremediation from landscaping is purposefully placing and growing a root-zone reactor volume with predictable pollutant removal performance. This phyto reactor integrates with other engineered systems to cover landfills, treat petrochemical spills in soils, intercept a soluble subsurface plume, and capture non-point surface sediment entrained in urban or field runoff. There are many potential economic opportunities for biomass associated with phytoremediation, including bioenergy and traditional industrial products such as solid wood products and reconstituted products (i.e., paper, chip board, laminated beams, extruded trim). More intangibly, phyto creates environmental benefits such as soil erosion control, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat. Phyto also creates socio-economic benefits by diversify regional manufacturing into new products that employs local labor, thus building value-added industry. Alternative crops develop a greater diversity of products from the farmland, making the regional economy less exposed to global commodity crop price fluctuations. Thus, a strategic phyto treatment of non-point agricultural runoff would help diversify land use from annually tilled crops (corn, soybeans, wheat) into perennial, untilled tree crops. A landscape rebuilt using phyto would create diversity represented in business potential, healthier air and water, wildlife habitat, and aesthetics. Moreover, phyto provides local and current pollutant treatment. Such timely treatment of pollutants that would otherwise move to our downstream or downwind neighbors is key to the environmental justice concept. We present four case study summaries to illustrate installed commercial applications of phytoremediation.","2005","2015-06-01 17:47:24","2015-06-02 01:07:46","","203-218","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000226348800011","","","","Brownfields; Environmental justice; Lagoon; Landfill; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Phytoremediation; Poplar; ScienceDirect; search.wheat; SPV; Streamside buffers; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Vegetation filter; Vegetative cap; Wastewater; Willow; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated treatment effects on differing community components across a gradient of initial invasion levels. We conducted a 6-yr experiment within grasslands of western Montana to measure local-scale effects of a broadcast application of picloram on 1) cover of the target invader, spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L.), 2) prevalence of native functional groups, and 3) the secondary invader cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) at differing initial levels of knapweed invasion. Treatment effectively suppressed knapweed, with cover in treated vs. control plots reduced by &gt;60% in the sixth posttreatment year. Treatment also appeared to alleviate knapweed’s impacts on native perennial grasses, but only at the highest initial level of invasion, where cover of this group increased by &gt;30% in treated vs. control plots to equal levels associated with noninvaded plots. In some cases, treatment appeared to exacerbate knapweed’s impacts on native forbs. At the no-invasion level, perennial forb cover declined by &gt;20% in treated vs. control plots to match values associated with moderate or high levels of invasion, but these treatment effects were minimal at the latter invasion levels. Across initial invasion levels, species richness of perennial and/or annual forbs declined by &gt;20% in treated vs. control plots. Treatment also promoted increases in cheatgrass cover, although differences between treated and control plots were relatively small by the sixth posttreatment year. Overall, effects of picloram application depended on initial levels of knapweed invasion, largely due to the varying strength of release effects. Selective treatment of invaded patches vs. broadcast applications would reduce side effects of broadleaf herbicide application and increase compatibility with other management measures designed to improve rangeland conditions and restore grassland communities.","January 2011","2015-06-01 19:23:23","2015-06-01 19:23:23","","67-77","","1","64","","Rangeland Ecology & Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","broadleaf herbicide; Centaurea maculosa; cheatgrass; exotic plants; grassland restoration; native plant functional groups; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatments consisted of conventional tillage (CT) and strip tillage (ST), rye (Secale cereale L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cover crops and a 22-yr rye-tomato rotation. Results of the first 5 yr indicated a decrease in tomato yield over time for both tillage treatments and cove crops. However, yield rebounded overall for treatments in 1992 with the highest yield in the rye-tomato rotation. We suspect this was a result of high populations of root-knot nematodes which collapsed over the winter of 1991/1992. Tomato yields were lower following wheat and perennial ryegrass than rye. In only 1 yr out of 6, strip-tillage reduced yield compared with conventional tillage. Bacterial speck/spot symptoms on foliage, although minor, were significantly greater in ST than in CT plots during the last 3 yr. No major trends in incidence and severity of bacterial and fungal diseases and of disorders of fruit were evident during the 5-yr period and neither fruit yield no quality were significantly affected by these factors. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne hapla Chitwood) were numerically less in the rye-tomato rotation than in other treatments; both root-knot and root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans [Cobb]) tended to be less numerous under CT than under ST. Strip-tillage is feasible for machine harvest processing tomatoes.

The intensity of nitrogen fertilising affects the source strength of N(2)O emissions and methane oxidation, in the soil. These trace gas fluxes were measured using the flux chamber method in combination with gas chromatography. The mean annually accumulated emission of N(2)O-N was 1.1 kg N(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) ranging from 0.4 to 5.2 kg N(2)O-N ha(-1) yr-1. Sandy soil fertilisation generally led to low N(2)O-N emissions, ranging from 0.2% to 0.7% of the applied nitrogen. Both, precipitation and temperature significantly influenced the total emission of N(2)O. The change from dry weather in 1999 to more humid weather in 2000 and 2001 resulted in enhanced N(2)O emissions. Enhanced N(2)O emission was also observed due to nitrogen fertilisation, soil cultivation processes and freeze-thaw cycles. Additionally, there were a few comparatively high local N(2)O emissions with peak values of 900 mug N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1). Methane (CH(4)) uptake has a clear relationship with soil temperature, having minimum values during the winter and maximum values during the summer. Increasing precipitation significantly reduces the methane uptake by the soil. Non-fertilised plots showed a higher reduction in CH(4) uptake due to increasing precipitation than fertilised plots. In sandy soils the mean annually accumulated CH(4) uptake varied from 0.36 kg CH(4) ha(-1) yr(-1) (2001) to 0.68 kg CH(4)ha(-1)yr(-1) (1999). With regard to the greenhouse gas balance of energy crops, the low uptake of methane compensates for only 1% of the CO(2) equivalent of the N-fertiliser-induced N(2)O emissions.","APR  2003","2015-06-01 17:30:37","2015-06-02 02:01:39","","1635-1644","","12","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000181997300008","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During grain-filling, substrate supply followed a bell shaped curve, and high temperature significantly shortened supply time. The rate of grain-filling did not change and paddy yield fell in both varieties. In high temperature, yield loss in IR8 was due to lighter grains relative to those grown in cool temperature, but in IR60, it was due to the early sacrifice of 30% of the spikelets. The yield of edible rice was zero for IR8 and ∼60% for IR60 for the high temperature treatments, and 100% for IR60 and 70% for IR8 in the cool temperature. IR60 differs from IR8 in regulation of substrate supply, architecture of the panicles and the capacity of the panicles to alter sink size in response to the stress and these factors may be responsible for the difference in edible rice in the two varieties.","2009","2015-06-01 20:25:52","2015-06-02 02:01:29","","1037-1045","","12","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Chalk; Grain-filling; High temperature; Perenniality; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Substrate supply; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maize (Zea mays L.) yields are as low as 1 Mg ha−1 or less, soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) at 0.3 to 0.8 Mg ha−1 in Indonesia and mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzek) around 0.5 Mg ha−1 in the Philippines. These are all very much below the yield potential of these soils. For example, mungbean yields of 2.2 Mg ha−1 have been achieved by IRRI in the Philippines on these soils without irrigation or additional fertilisers. The causes of low yields of DS crops after rice are mainly poor crop establishment and poor root growth due to soil physical constraints. These result from the breakdown of soil structure during wet cultivation (puddling) for rice. Yields are also limited by biological and chemical constraints. As a result of these low yields, farmers are reluctant to invest in post-rice crops. Therefore, land after lowland rice (at least 51 million ha in Asia according to Huke [Huke, R.E., 1982. Rice Area by Type of Culture: South, Southeast, and East Asia. International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines, 32 pp.]) represents an underutilised resource that can be used to meet the food requirement of the ever increasing population of the developing world. To increase the utilisation of these soils, improved management practices are required to enable dry season crops to use the stored water in the soil profile after the rice crop. This paper outlines a project which was established with the general objective of developing soundly based soil management technologies that can overcome soil physical limitations to DS crop production after lowland rice. The specific objectives of the program were1. to test a range of soil management and agronomic practices that have the potential to overcome adverse soil physical conditions for DS crops after rice, across a range of soil and climates; 2. to evaluate these practices by2.1. measuring the changes in soil physical conditions throughout the complete cropping cycle from rice to DS crops; 2.2. determining the performance of the DS crop (establishment and growth) and its ability to extract soil water. 3. to determine the mechanisms involved in dispersion due to puddling and in flocculation and structural development as the soil dries after draining surface water from rice fields. Relevant outcomes from this project are described in the following papers in this issue.","July 2000","2015-06-01 19:21:55","2015-06-02 01:08:17","","3-14","","1–2","56","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legumes; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Puddling; Rainfed lowland; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil management; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herbicides were used to control weeds and volunteer sorghum seedlings without killing the primary plants. The selected cultivars displayed some midge resistance, disease resistance, staygreen trait and cold tolerance. The initial harvest was timed to coincide with winter. Advantages of the system include savings in establishment costs, optimum utilization of low rainfall, and protection from soil erosion.

The genetic changes of small populations are tightly associated with their mating pattern, because small populations generally have increased selfing and local inbreeding rates, leading to the effect of genetic drift and loss of genetic variability. Oryza rufipogon Griff, is agriculturally the most important but seriously endangered wild rice species due to rapid decline of population size. To better understand how mating system can be used for species conservation, outcrossing rate, genetic variability at maternal and seedling phases in a small population were examined at seven polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci. Thirty six reproductive individuals and 601 progenies from 20 open-pollinated seed families were measured. The family outcrossing rates varied among plants with an average of 0.318. A high correlation of matings was revealed and about 50% offspring shared the same paternal and maternal genitors, indicating a mixed mating system in the Oryza population. The level of genetic diversity in progeny population was higher than that in maternal population. The maternal population showed significant heterozygote excess, suggesting the selection advantage of heterozygotes. In contrast, significant heterozygote deficit occurred in progeny population, which might have been caused by the increasing of inbreeding in declining population. These results suggest that expanding population size is of significance for in-situ conservation of Oryza rufipogon.","2008","2015-06-01 20:26:04","2015-06-01 20:26:04","","1608-1615","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Conservation; genetic diversity; Mating system; Oryza rufipogon Griff.; Scopus; search.rice; Small population; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.","Meadow plants of the mountainous parts in the Maikop district.","Sovetskaya Botanika","","","","","The moderate climate due to the proximity of the Black Sea and the main Caucasian mountain chains has a profound influence on the phylogeny of the Maikop ecotypes, all of which belong to a strongly winter group. As Maikop ecotypes are sensitive to frost and are hydrophilous, they cannot be cultivated in steppes. Earliness can be traced to their place of origin and increases with increasing elevation. This has caused an immigration from the upper zones, and the presence of some alpine forms in the lowland associations. The ecological groups which can be distinguished include the deciduous forest (where Vicia spp., Medicago falcata, timothy, etc. occur), coniferous forest (with Dactylis, Secale and Galega) and the alpine associations, which include the earliest ecotypes. Trifolium ambiguum M.B. belongs to the last group, but is found even near the steppes; its seed yield is good and it is easily reproduced from seed; being a rhizogamous type, it endures grazing well, and is thus an excellent pasture crop. The stems 30 to 40 cm. in length tend to lodge, but several forms with an erect habit were selected. The habit of the species suggests its suitability in zones with adequate humidity and short vegetative season. Good results were obtained when tested at the Polar Department of the U.S.S.R. Institute of Plant Industry, Hibiny. Although Secale Kuprijanovii Grossh., a perennial rye segregated by A.A. Grossheim from S. montanum Guss., has a number of defects, it is nevertheless an exceptionally valuable forage and pasture plant, producing an abundant undergrowth and enduring grazing. Readiness to cross with S. cereale facilitates its easy and quick improvement. Maikop ecotypes of legumes are hydrophilous and late with a prostrate type of bush which not infrequently reaches a considerable size. Among forms which have not yet been introduced into cultivation, Vicia tenuifolia Path is valued for excellent fodder qualities. Of its two Maikop ecotypes, the small-seeded vigourous (though late) form from the upper parts of slopes is particularly valuable for breeding. V. serratifolia Jack. gives a somewhat coarse fodder, but a high yield. Maikop ecotypes of Medicago falcata, contrary to the steppe ecotypes, possesses a high coefficient of seed production. Their hydrophilous nature makes them unsuitable for use in steppes; they are also late, producing high forage yield and their bush ranges from prostrate to erect in type. Although the yield of Maikop ecotypes of Galega orientalis Lam. is high, the plants are avoided by grazing cattle and their palatability should be ascertained. Late timothy ecotypes are also mentioned; Dactylis glomerata occurs in more or less elevated parts and is, on the contrary, very early.-M.A.O.","1935","2015-06-01 17:39:53","2015-06-01 17:39:53","","84-90","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19360700342","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system. Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40-44% of the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16-33% of GWP in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) y(-1). Carbon accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for > 10 years while the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion to NT.","MAY  2005","2015-06-01 17:47:18","2015-06-01 17:47:18","","67-76","","1","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000232265900007","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2n = 4x = 28) with blue couch grass Agropyron glaucum (Desf.) Roem. et Schult. [Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski] (2n = 6x = 42), a method has been developed for creation of stable hexaploid intermediate Triticum-Agropyron hybrids (HITAH). These hybrids possess the complete genome complex of durum wheat (AB) and one of the genomes (E) from couch grass. The method incorporates intergeneric crossing, backcrossing with wheat, and one or two self-pollinations. Data are cited on the formative process observed, together with results of cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in subsequent generations. Also presented are data of different authors and our own investigations on the genome structures of couch grass that served as the basis for obtaining HITAH. Especially significant in this regard were investigations of previously created octoploid intermediate Triticum-Agropyron hybrids (perennial and forage grain wheat). The cited data indicate that the mechanism of incorporation of one of the genomes of couch grass (E) into the genome complex of durum wheat (AB) is realized fairly readily due to the fact that this species in genome structure is an incomplete autotetraploid (B2B2E1E1E2E2), and the E genome found in the tetraploid number can therefore be transferred to the chromosome structure of another botanical genus. Analytical crossings of stable HITAH with cultivars of durum, soft, and perennial wheat and cytogenetic analysis of the obtained F1 plants confirmed that HITAH possess ABE genomes, AB from durum wheat and E from blue couch grass.","December 1991","2015-06-01 19:58:35","2015-06-01 19:58:35","","717-728","","6","27","","Soviet genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.wheat; SPV; TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat))","chromosome pairing; cytogenetics; Elytrigia intermedia subsp. intermedia; genomics; intergeneric hybridization; meiosis; polyploidy; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We relied on a field experiment in Northeast Thailand where organic residues of contrasting biochemical quality (g kg−1) (rice straw (RS, 5 nitrogen (N), 29 lignin (L), 7 polyphenols (PP), 507 cellulose (CL)), groundnut stover (GN, 23 N, 68 L, 13 PP, 178 CL), dipterocarp (DP, 6 N, 176 L, 65 PP, 306 CL) and tamarind (TM, 14 N, 88 L, 32 PP, 143 CL) were applied yearly since the experiment started in 1995. At the end of year 13 (2008), samples of the bulk soil (0–15 cm) were obtained to evaluate the long-term effect of residue inputs on SOC composition. In addition, short-term microbial decomposition of the same residues in litter bags was assessed at intervals during a 26 week period to relate the biochemical quality of decomposing residues to SOC composition in bulk soils. All samples were subjected to midDRIFTS peak area analysis to categorize the abundance (“low” versus “high”) of the most prominent labile and stable organic functional groups. The spectral information was used to examine four mechanisms (i.e., physico-chemical protection, C loss, regulatory N effect and SOC stabilization) that are responsible for SOC composition. A conceptual model for residue decomposition was formulated based on an established approach to classifying residues according to their N, L and PP contents, which we extended by adding the CL content and modifying the threshold levels of these four biochemical properties. Combining mechanistic evaluation of SOC composition together with the conceptual model of decomposition controlled by organic residue quality provided deeper insights into the microbially mediated regulation of SOC stabilization and composition. We conclude that this approach will have important implications for soil organic matter management aimed at supplying N and sequestering C in sandy soils.","September 2014","2015-06-01 19:23:19","2015-06-01 19:23:19","","100-108","","0","76","","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conceptual model; Litter bag study; MidDRIFTS peak area analysis; Organic residue quality; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SOC composition; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typical cultural practices effective at reducing soil- and residue-borne pathogens, such as annual crop rotations, delayed fall planting, and tillage, are not feasible in perennial systems. Consequently, soil- and residue-borne pathogens, and pathogens such as root colonizers and viruses that survive in live tissue, may increase in importance in a perennial grain crop. Resistance genes will undeniably be important defenses against disease. However, it is seldom, if ever, possible to incorporate within a single cultivar resistance to all existing and future important diseases. Furthermore. genes vulnerable to 'boom and bust' cycles are generally short-lived when deployed in monocultures. For these reasons, the use of mixtures of crop cultivars or species that vary in resistance functions will likely be an important strategy for managing diseases and pests of perennial grains. Burning of plant residue, a natural phenomenon in native perennial grass systems, may also be an effective disease management strategy. The successful implementation of these management tools may reduce or eliminate the risk that perennial grain crops will become pathogen refugia that affect neighboring annual plantings and the productivity of perennial plants.","MAR  2005","2015-06-01 17:18:46","2015-06-01 17:18:46","","15-24","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000229467200005","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both chilling and freezing temperatures have severe effects on growth of plants and have resulted in temperate plants, such as perennial rye grass and wheat to evolve mechanisms to avoid or, at the very least, minimize this damage. Accumulating osmoprotectants including glycine betaine, sugars (trehalose and fructans), polyamines, changes in lipid membrane profile, photosynthetic acclimation along with extensive reprogramming at molecular level help temperate plants acquire tolerance to low temperatures. In this review, we have focused mainly on metabolic engineering of plants by introduction of biosynthetic genes involved in various metabolic pathways. Availability of genomic, transcriptomic sequences combined with post-transcriptional data is beginning to link the gene function, regulatory networks and epigenetic states to different phenotypes. Generation of this knowledge together with our ability to manipulate genes involved in mediating tolerance to various stressors including low temperature will lead to the development of cold-resistant genotypes.","January 2014","2015-06-01 19:32:53","2015-06-01 19:32:53","","88-95","","1","3","","Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compatible solutes; Low temperature; miRNAs; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; search.rye; Soluble sugars; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment plots contained the semidwarf, early, long-grain rice cultivar Texmont, drill-seeded into a Crowley silt loam soil (Typic Albaqualfs). Main crop treatments were (i) urea (100 kg N ha-1) with rice plants, (ii) urea without plants and (iii) unfertilized plants; ratoon crop treatments consisted of (i) urea (84 kg N ha-1) with plants (ii) urea with plants plus rice straw (10 tons ha-1) and (iii) unfertilized plants. Methane emissions from the microplots were measured over the 77-day first crop and 73-day ratoon crop growing seasons. A closed-chamber technique was used to collect CH4 gas samples in the morning and afternoon hours. Significant urea fertilizer and rice straw effects were observed, and CH4 fluxes were highly variable over the two rice-cropping seasons. Over the main crop-growing season (77 days) approximately 50, 240, and 340 kg of CH4 ha-1 were released to the atmosphere from the urea without plants, unfertilized plants, and urea with plants treatments, respectively. Methane emissions from the ratoon crop (73 days) were 220, 520, and 1,490 kg ha-1 for the unfertilized plants, urea with plants, and urea with plants plus rice straw treatments, respectively. Approximately 1,830 kg of CH4 ha-1 were emitted from the urea-treated planted plots over the 150-day collection period provided the first crop straw was left in the field after harvest.","JUL  1993","2015-06-01 18:29:25","2015-06-01 18:29:25","","42-48","","1","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1993LP25200006","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their adaptation to a recently created habitat, the crop field, produced a novel form: the plant that allocates an unprecedented 30-60% of its net productivity to sexual structures. Long-lived trees, shrubs and vines of this form evolved, as did annual herbs. Perennial herb forms with increased allocation to asexual reproduction evolved, but there are no examples of perennial herbs with high sexual effort. We suggest that sowing seed into annually tilled fields favored shorter-lived herbs because of trade-offs between first-year seed production and relative growth rate and/or persistence. By propagating cuttings, people quickly domesticated tuber crops and large woody plants. Perennial herbs were too small to be efficiently propagated by cuttings, and the association between longevity, allogamy and genetic load made rapid domestication by sexual cycles unlikely. Perennial grain crops do not exist because they could not have evolved under the original set of conditions; however, they can be deliberately developed today through artificial phenotypic and genotypic selection.","SEP  2010","2015-06-01 17:18:16","2015-06-02 01:09:49","","434-452","","5-6","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000281311700004","","","","Domestication; Life form; Lifespan; New crops; Perennial grains; Reproductive effort; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The values of the exponent α in the equation varies generally between 1.0 and 3.0 depending on the type of vegetation, stem density, height, sowing pattern, stage of growth, and flow condition, and confirms that assuming a constant value (i.e., 5/3) for the exponent in the Manning equation is not appropriate.

Particularly in layered soils, interpretation of ECa variations would be enhanced with better calibrations to depth-wise variations in these soil properties. Thus, the objective of this research was to combine point measurements of layer conductivity obtained using ECa-equipped penetrometers with mapped ECa data from proximal sensors for improved quantification of conductivity–depth relationships in layered soils. Data were collected from a set of large plots on a claypan-soil landscape in central Missouri which had been managed in grain and perennial grass cropping systems for 20 years. Soil ECa variation with depth was represented by both two- and three-layer models that were visualized and parameterized with the use of penetrometer ECa data. The three-layer model provided a more realistic representation of the soil profiles in the study area and provided similar topsoil depth estimation accuracy as the commonly used two layer model. Penetrometer ECa data also provided efficient and accurate (r2 = 0.92) estimation of calibration-point topsoil depth as an alternative to soil coring and manual determination. A key to accurate model calibration was selection of points from areas of spatially-homogeneous proximal ECa. Combining penetrometer ECa with proximal ECa data improved modeling of conductivity–depth relationships in terms of model selection, model parameterization, and model calibration.","May 2013","2015-06-01 19:18:38","2015-06-02 01:11:02","","12-21","","0","199","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Claypan; Electrical conductivity; Model inversion; Penetrometer; perennial W/1 grain; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Topsoil depth; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is clear that biofuels can help meet some of the increasing need for energy. Theoretically, these can be produced from a variety of biological materials, including agricultural residues (such as corn stover and wheat straw), perennial grasses, legumes, algae, and other biological materials. Currently, however, the most heavily utilized material is corn starch. Industrial fuel ethanol production in the US primarily uses corn, because it is readily converted into fuel at a relatively low cost compared to other biomass sources. The production of corn-based ethanol in the US is dramatically increasing. As the industry continues to grow, the amount of byproducts and coproducts also increases. At the moment, the nonfermentable residues (which are dried and sold as distillers dried grains with solubles - DDGS) are utilized only as livestock feed. The sale of coproducts provides ethanol processors with a substantial revenue source and significantly increases the profitability of the production process. Even though these materials are used to feed animals in local markets, as the size and scope of the industry continues to grow, the need to ship large quantities of coproducts grows as well. This includes both domestic as well as international transportation. Value-added processing options offer the potential to increase the sustainability of each ethanol plant, and thus the industry overall. However, implementation of new technologies will be dependent upon how their costs interact with current processing costs and the logistics of coproduct deliveries. The objective of this study was to examine some of these issues by developing a computer model to determine potential cost ramifications of using various alternative technologies during ethanol processing. This paper focuses specifically on adding a densification unit operation (i.e., pelleting) to produce value-added DDGS at a fuel ethanol manufacturing plant. We have examined the economic implications of pelleting DDGS for varying DDGS production rates (100-1000 tons/d) and pelleting rates (0-100%), for a series of DDGS sales prices ($50-$200/ton). As the proportion of pelleting increases, the cost of transporting DDGS to distant markets drastically declines, because the rail cars can be filled to capacity. For example, at a DDGS sales price of $50/ton, 100% pelleting will reduce shipping costs (both direct and indirect) by 89% compared to shipping the DDGS in bulk form (i.e., no pelleting), whereas at a DDGS sales price of $200/ton, it will reduce costs by over 96%. It is clear that the sustainability of the ethanol industry can be improved by implementing pelleting technology for the coproducts, especially at those plants that ship their DDGS via rail.","2009","2015-06-01 20:43:03","2015-06-02 01:11:36","","6550-6558","","24","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Biofuels; DDGS; Distillers grains; Logistics; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; Simulation; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","algorithms; biofuels; biomass; costs and returns; distillers grains; econometric models; ethanol production; food processing wastes; mathematical models; renewable energy sources; shipping; simulation models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the impact of rising carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and projected climate changes on these pasture ecosystems in southeastern Tasmania, Australia, using a biophysical simulation model, EcoMod. The model consists of interdependent modules that describe soil physicochemical and hydrological characteristics, and pasture growth and senescence, with fluxes described by empirical and mechanistic equations. Our simulations showed that in native pastures, projected climate change increased the biomass of C4 grasses, with limited impact upon C3 grasses, a trend reversed by rising [CO2]. In sown pastures, projected climate change decreased the biomass of perennial rye grass Lolium perenne and total biomass markedly by 2070, whilst subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum biomass increased. Subterranean clover biomass changed little with increased [CO2] alone, whereas perennial rye grass biomass increased. Responses across pastures reflected species' tolerances to environmental factors, with projected climate change generally having more of an impact on biomass than rising [CO2]. Changes in both [CO 2] and climate led to a reduction in protein content and digestibility. Soil inorganic nutrient concentrations decreased with increasing [CO2] and increased with projected climate change. Further simulations should investigate whether these patterns are robust for different sites and alternative environmental futures. Our results reinforce the need to pursue adaptation strategies in response to environmental change in order to maintain productive pasture ecosystems.","2010","2015-06-01 20:29:02","2015-06-02 02:01:08","","65-78","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Ecosystem model; Lolium perenne; Nutrient availability; Productivity; Scopus; search.rye; Simulation; SPV; Tasmania; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CCD7 and CCD8 genes were isolated from A. chinensis and these genes are predominantly expressed in the roots of kiwifruit. AcCCD7 and AcCCD8 were able to complement the corresponding Arabidopsis mutants max3 and max4. The function of AcCCD8 in branch development was determined in transgenic kiwifruit plants containing an RNAi construct for AcCCD8.

The process consisted in adding about 40 lb. molasses, diluted for ease of application, to every ton of fodder. The sugar content of the undiluted molasses was about 50 per cent. The molasses mixture was added to the fodder in several ways, e. g. with watering cans and feeding through the blower and cutter. The process is designed especially for the preservation of protein rich crops; no benefit is claimed from using the sugar process for cereals and other crops rich in carbohydrates. Because of its cheapness, molasses was the form of sugar used. In both tower and pit silos, lined or unlined, there was practically no loss of nutrients as determined by chemical analysis and by feeding trials. The particular value of the process is the production of a fermentation, chiefly of lactic acid type, which suppresses organisms which break down proteins. A daily ration of from 70 to 90 Ib. of the silage may be fed. The experiments indicated the practicability of providing the equivalent of green crops for stock throughout the year.-D. S.

Results of screening of 134 ILs using 172 SSR primers showed that the average genetic ratios of resistant ILs (Resistance Score, RS≤5) and susceptible ILs (RS >5) were 20.4% and 13.0% for O. officinalis and non-parental genotypes, respectively. Markers linked to BPH resistance were detected on 10 out of the 12 rice chromosomes except for chromosomes 1 and chromosome 8 in which BPH resistant markers were absent. There was a single IL harboring BPH resistant markers on as high as 9 chromosomes, whereas 25 resistant ILs showed no markers linked to BPH resistance Furthermore, KPM2, a marker co-segregating with Bph2 gene, was also detected in the donor parent O. officinalis and 4 other ILs.

Confirmed species hybrids between S. bicolor and S. halepense would provide resources for investigating risks of invasiveness and transgene escape alongside potential for identifying novel perennial Sorghum feedstocks of value. Study design: Bulked segregant analysis of Sorghum species and S. species hybrids. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Soil & Crop Sciences; Texas A&M University; College Station, TX, USA; 2009-2011. Methodology: A bulked segregant analysis approach was conducted using SSRs mined from the S. bicolor genome sequence. Bulked samples of S. bicolor, typical flowering S. halepense, non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids, and triploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids were surveyed to identify both unique markers specific to each bulk and markers indicative of S. bicolor genetic material introgressed into the Sorghum spp. hybrids. Results: Thirty-nine and 23 markers were found to be unique to the S. bicolor and typical flowering S. halepense bulks, respectively. These unique markers could be utilized in breeding programs to identify interspecific hybrids. A subset of 23 unique SSRs were found in the non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrid, and they may be useful in the characterization of the non-flowering phenotype. Conclusion: Markers identified in this study provide: (1) species-specific tools for confirmation of interspecific Sorghum spp. hybrids and quantification of gene flow between Sorghum spp., (2) candidate gene and genomic region resources for dissection of the non-flowering phenotype, and (3) Sorghum spp. hybrid-specific markers suitable towards development of perennial biofuel and forage sorghum feedstocks.","2012","2015-06-01 17:42:18","2015-06-01 17:42:18","","9-20","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20123099855","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent research has demonstrated that the Australian AA genome perennial populations have maternal genomes more closely related to those of O. meridionalis than to those found in Asian populations of O. rufipogon suggesting that the Australian perennials may represent a new distinct gene pool for rice. Results: Analysis of an Oryza core collection covering AA genome species from Asia to Oceania revealed that some Oceania perennials had organellar genomes closely related to that of O meridionalis (meridionalis-type). O. rufipogon accessions from New Guinea carried either the meridionalis-type or rufirpogon-type (like O. rufipogon) organellar genomes. Australian perennials carried only the meridionalis-type organellar genomes when accompanied by the rufipogon-type nuclear genome. New accessions were collected to better characterize the Australian perennials, and their life histories (annual or perennial) were confirmed by field observations. All of the material collected carried only meridionalis-type organellar genomes. However, there were two distinct perennial groups. One of them carried an rufipogon-type nuclear genome similar to the Australian O. rufipogon in the core collection and the other carried an meridionalis-type nuclear genome not represented in the existing collection. Morphologically the rufipogon-type shared similarity with Asian O. rufipogon. The meridionalis-type showed some similarities to O. meridionalis such as the short anthers usually characteristic of annual populations. However, the meridionalis-type perennial was readily distinguished from O. meridionalis by the presence of a larger lemma and higher number of spikelets. Conclusion: Analysis of current accessions clearly indicated that there are two distinct types of Australian perennials. Both of them differed genetically from Asian O. rufipogon. One lineage is closely related to O. meridionalis and another to Asian O. rufipogon. The first was presumed to have evolved by divergence from O. meridionalis becoming differentiated as a perennial species in Australia indicating that it represents a new gene pool. The second, apparently derived from Asian O. rufipogon, possibly arrived in Australia later.","2013","2015-06-01 20:25:34","2015-06-02 01:12:04","","","","26","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Annual; Australia; Genetic divergence; Oryza meridionalis; Oryza rufipogon; Perennial; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The legumes (pea, red clover, lucerne) accumulated larger amounts of nitrogen but lower amounts of K than rye, ryegrass, barley, and oilseed rape. The differences in K accumulation correlated with root hair length (R(2) = 0.50). Rye had an outstanding root surface that in total as well as per unit root dry matter was twice that of the other crops. The ranking in decreasing order was rye, ryegrass, oilseed rape, lucerne, barley, pea, and red clover. This ranking was unaffected (P > 0.05) by the initial soil K content although the root surface in all cases increased when grown in soil low on K compared to soils with a better K supply. This increase was achieved by increasing root hair length as root hair density was similar (P > 0.05) for all crops and soils.

The two varieties were grown under salinity levels of 0, 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1) and irrigated when the leaf water potential reached -1 (control), -1.5 and -2 MPa. Salinity and irrigation frequency significantly affected stem diameter, number of tillers, plant height, total leaf area and cumulative dry matter yield of ratoon forage sorghum (P<0.01). Low soil water (-2 MPa) reduced plant height in non-saline and medium saline conditions by 33.4 and 28.9%, respectively, whereas in highly saline soil there was 34.4% reduction in plant height even at medium water stress (-1.5 MPa). Maximum number of tillers (2.48 tillers plant(-1)) was produced in non-saline soil. Low soil water content and high salinity reduced the number of tillers produced. Total leaf area of plants also decreased with increasing salinity and irrigation interval. Overall Speedfeed variety had stems with a smaller mean diameter than KFS4 and produced a higher number of tillers than KFS4. Regardless of variety, leaf firing increased with increasing salinity, reaching 59.95% in the extreme salinity treatment of 15 dS m(-1), and it increased with increasing water stress reaching 48.77% in the extreme water stress treatment of -2 MPa. However, there was less water deficit and salinity injury noticeable in KFS4 at all irrigation levels compared to Speedfeed.

L.","My journey in changing facets of agronomic research during three decades of green revolution in India","Indian Journal of Agronomy","","0537-197X","","","The changing facets of agronomic research in India as observed and followed by me during the past three decades, are reviewed in this paper. Green Revolution ushered in a new paradigm of agronomic management of crops in India. Fertilizer responsiveness of dwarf wheat generated heavy demand of fertilizers and gave major boost to the Indian fertilizer industry. Thus, due to the increased availability of fertilizers in the market, sugarcane farmers also started using heavy doses of N fertilizer to improve the cane yield, but at the cost of sugar content. Therefore, determination of optimum dose of N became important. In the first decade of my research career, I worked in this direction to work out the optimum dose and time of N application in sugarcane. Later on, with the introduction of fertilizer-responsive short-duration varieties in many crops like pulses and oilseeds, multiple cropping emerged as an important concept for intensification of agriculture. Consequently, I reoriented my research activities to develop companion cropping system with sugarcane and worked out fertilizer requirement of different crop combinations. Within two decades of Green Revolution, due to expansion of irrigation facility, rice-wheat crop rotation became predominant production system in the Indo-Gangetic plains, with gradual decrease in the area under pulse cultivation. Efforts were made to introduce pulses as companion crops of sugarcane for sustaining soil fertility and providing extra income to cane growers. Within a short span of time rice-wheat system, due to heavy demand of nutrients developed soil fatigue and witnessed decline in factor productivity. My research interest again changed during 1980s towards conservation of soil-organic carbon, by utilizing the organic farm waste material and crop residues. Various options of green-manuring were also tried in rice-wheat and sugarcane-based cropping systems to achieve this objective and to increase the fertilizer-use efficiency. From high-input agronomy, my research interest thus, finally changed to conservation agronomy. Conservation of soil moisture through trash mulching, in-situ decomposition of trash using bio-agents and bio-manuring to improve the soil fertility as well as nutrient-use efficiency has now become my prime concern. In sugarcane, the improvement in productivity of ratoon crop remained a major research activity throughout my career.","DEC  2008","2015-06-01 18:23:12","2015-06-01 18:23:12","","245-254","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200900407146","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of an NFRB protects our living environment from deterioration (especially soil erosion) by increasing the surface coverage of the world's land, even in mountainous areas. Additionally a functioning NFRB enhances food sustainably and security, representing a tangible and renewable food resource production system. Research has identified the prospects of cultivating the NFRB in the form of forestry and also grassland. The review investigated the distinct differences of an NFRB from a range of approaches and discusses the environmental advantage and feasibility of cultivating NFRB. The ability of the NFRB to realize sustainable food resources production for ensuring food security is evaluated in terms of environmental and economical feasibility. A NFRB can attenuate climatic change by increasing CO2 absorption and fixation. It is worth considering the replacement of the annual food production system by the NFRB (especially in steeplands) in environmental law, and replacing the policy of maintaining annual food reserves by the NFRB in food security policy.","MAY  2014","2015-06-01 17:17:28","2015-06-01 17:17:28","","109-117","","2","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000336458200003","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture's dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essentials for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature's ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans can now build an agriculture based on nature's ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture.","February 2002","2015-06-01 19:46:08","2015-06-02 01:13:40","","111-117","","2","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Agriculture; Nature; perennial W/1 grain; Polyculture; ScienceDirect; search.grain; SPV; Sustainable; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (perennial N1 grain); WOS","agriculture; agrochemicals; alternative farming; disease control; domestication; ecology; ecosystems; evolution; insect pests; literature reviews; perennials; pest management; petroleum; plant pathogens; seed productivity; soil erosion; soil pollution; weed control; weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rows were composed of alternating strips of 4 plants of each species, which were staggered such that adjacent rows had plants of different species.

To feed the world, modern agriculture is primarily based on annual grain crops that replace native perennial plant communities on most of the arable land on the planet. This practice may not be sustainable due to high inputs of fresh water, fertilizers, and herbicides; soil erosion; and runoff water pollution. Recent biotechnology breakthroughs enable the fractionation of nonfood lignocellulosic biomass to multiple components, the conversion of nonfood cellulose to starch without sugar loss, the production of in vitro meat without slaughtering livestock, and the production of healthy oil from microbes, suggesting great opportunities of new biorefineries based on nonfood biomass. Perennial plant communities have higher biomass yield per hectare, have easily resource management, store more carbon, maintain better water quality, utilize nutrients more efficiently, tolerate more extreme weather events, and resist pests better than annual crops. Sustainable agriculture based on annual grains and perennial high-biomass yield plants along with new biorefineries could produce a myriad of products from biofuels (e.g., butanol and hydrogen), biomaterials, to food/feed. Sustainable agriculture and new biorefineries could be cornerstones of the coming sustainability revolution based on the most abundant renewable bioresource−biomass.","July 2015","2015-06-01 19:21:59","2015-06-02 01:14:01","","117-132","","0","47","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biofuels; Biorefineries; Perennial crop; perennial W/1 grain; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; SPV; Sustainability revolution; Sustainable agriculture; Synthetic food; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluation was based on green-wt. yields from a swath mowed across each plot prior to each grazing in a study of 36 mixtures in plots 25 ft. square replicated 6 times. The highest yielding mixture, over a 4-yr. period, contained smooth brome 4, orchard 3, tall oat 4, tall fescue 4, Ranger alfalfa 3, Ladino clover 2, and red clover 3 lbs. per acre. Owing to tall fescue this mixture was low in palatability. First-year results from a 1946 planting of 32 mixtures in plots 22.5 ft. square replicated 12 times indicate that tall fescue can be replaced and palatability improved with no loss in yield. Apparently, several combinations using smooth brome, orchard, tall oat or Reed canary with Ladino clover and Ranger alfalfa or red clover will give high producing pastures. Red clover contributes heavily to yield the first 2 grazing seasons. Tall oat gives high production quicker than any other grass. Smooth brome is slow and Reed canary slowest. Mixtures containing red clover should also include tall oat or orchard, or both, in order to hold the clovers below 60% as a safeguard against bloat. In all plantings barley was used as a nurse crop. Satisfactory stands were obtained by grazing the nurse crop in 1946, but the total returns for 1946 and 1947 were greater from plots that matured a crop of grain. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors","1947","2015-06-01 17:38:39","2015-06-01 17:38:39","","5-16-18","","(4)","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19482200007273","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, intermediate wheatgrass is currently being domesticated as a perennial grain crop. However, the genetic information for molecular breeding is quite limited. Here we report a molecular analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in intermediate wheatgrass using gene cloning and protein biochemistry. Five HMW-GS genes were isolated from individual intermediate wheatgrass plants: two x-type genes TiHGS1 and TiHGS4, and three y-type genes TiHGS2, TiHGS3 and TiHGS5. Among them, TiHGS5 was novel and possessed an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminal domain or repetitive domain. Sequence alignments showed that TiHGS1 and TiHGS2 genes shared high identities (&gt;96%) with the Glu-1Dx and Glu-1Dy genes, respectively, in common wheat and Aegilops species, TiHGS3 with HMW-GS genes from Dasypyrum or Pseudoroegneria, and TiHGS4 and TiHGS5 with HMW-GS genes from Thinopyrum elongatum.

Recently obtained genetic evidence provides new insights into this complex story. Genome-wide studies of variation demonstrate that the two varietal groups in Oryza sativa (indica and japonica) arose from genetically distinct gene pools within a common wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon, suggesting multiple domestications of O. sativa. However, the evolutionary history of recently cloned domestication genes adds another layer of complexity to the domestication of rice. Although some alleles exist only within specific subpopulations, as would be expected if the domestications occurred independently, other major domestication alleles are common to all cultivated O. sativa varieties. Our current view of rice domestication supports multiple domestications coupled with limited introgression that transferred key domestication alleles between divergent rice gene pools.","November 2007","2015-06-01 19:21:45","2015-06-01 19:21:45","","578-587","","11","23","","Trends in Genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forms with a suitable range of times of maturity can often be produced by selection, since many lines of the common varieties are mixed in this respect; as well as by Lysenko's method of crossing forms differing in the length of the first two developmental stages. The same principle can be applied to producing hardy varieties for the north, since cold resistance is very much correlated with the first developmental stage. A great advance in the direction of relieving the pressure at the beginning of harvest is afforded by the new perennial cereals produced by crossing with Agropyrum, perennial rye, etc., some of which in their second and later years mature much earlier than any other cereals, even winter rye, and can be harvested before the real pressure begins.

Some compatible N fixing trees under coconut are described, i.e. gliricidia ( Gliricidia maculata), coral tree ( Erythrina indica [ E. variegata]), agati ( Sesbania grandiflora), mangium ( Acacia mangium), subalbul ( Leucaena leucocephala), perennial pigeon pea ( Cajanus cajan) and casuarina ( Casuarina equisetifolia). By integrating N fixing trees in the coconut-based mixed cropping system, the use of chemical fertilizers could be minimized. Reduction in the use of nitrogenous fertilizers controls the emission of nitrous oxide which has ~300 times the warming capacity of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. The tree species introduced in the system will also assimilate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the tree biomass and soil. In this way, the N fixing tree population in the system contributes to climate change mitigation besides supporting important ecosystem services. Although N fixation is impeded in fertile soils, the trees could still perform protective functions benefiting the system as a whole.","2010","2015-06-01 17:24:15","2015-06-01 17:24:15","","2-6","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20103287549","","","","search.pigeonpea; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual plant fractions (leaves/stems/roots/flowers), 23 g dry matter pot(-1) (corresponding to 7300 kg ha(-1)), were incorporated into a sandy soil. The net mineralization of N was measured as N-15 recovery in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) following the wheat and in the soil mineral N pool. Dry matter and N yields of the wheat crop were largest in pots receiving the legume leaf materials and the oldest root fractions. The largest amount of net N mineralized was obtained after application of sweetclover leaves, 381 mg N pot(-1) (38% of added N), and a smaller amount was measured from red clover leaves, 215 mg N pot(-1) (26% of added N). The N release was much smaller from the stems, being on average 63 mg N pot(-1) (15% of added N), with intermediate values obtained from roots, 152 mg N pot(-1) (26% of added N). The effects of age of the legume fractions on net N mineralization were more pronounced for sweetclover than for red clover materials. Greater net N release was obtained from sweetclover leaves and roots with inceasing age, but the opposite was valid for stems. At final harvest of the ryegrass, an additional 2.8% of added legume N was mineralized, compared with at wheat harvest. The net N mineralized proportion of added N was significantly related to concentrations of N and cell wall constituents in the plant material. Differences in net N mineralization estimates were generally larger between plant fractions than between materials of different age, implying that leaf proportion of the above-ground biomass is of great importance when predicting net N mineralization from green-manure plant materials. In addition, the contribution from roots to net mineralized legume N could be substantial.","1999","2015-06-01 17:47:56","2015-06-01 17:47:56","","21-31","","1","208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000080566900003","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plots were occasionally irrigated. Infections by S. sorghi seemed to be more serious during the dry season (spring) than during and immediately after the rainy season. Chlamydospores remained viable for almost a yr. when kept dry in the laboratory. When smutted inflorescences and stalks were left in a heap in the field the chlamydospores showed fair viability after more than 7 mos. and induced infections amounting to 25-40 % of the control. When chlamydospores were mixed with soil and left in the field, with a light cover (a wire net), they were dead after 7 mos.; without protection they died within 40 days. The presence of glumes did not affect the results; and broken seed had no influence on infection. No effect from different fertilizers was detected. At harvest the parasite was still present in the stubble; heavily infected plants did not sprout again. Infection increased in the ratoon crop and spread from a smutted plot to an originally unaffected one. 26 vars. were tested for reaction S. sorghi and also, to Cercospora sorghi, Gloeocercospora sorghi, and Helmin-thosporium turcicum. Seed produced in Venezuela was often badly infected. Various fungicides were tested for seed disinfection and gave good control of the disease. Some fungicides were tested both in laboratory cultures and in the field at concns. lower and higher than ordinary, and the effect on germination and emergence were noted.

Timopheevi and T. polonicum and the soft wheats: A. intermedium, A. trichophorum, A. obtusiuscum [sic] and A. elongatum. The soft wheats were autumn forms and the hard, mainly spring forms. With all the species of Agropyron the highest percentage set was obtained from the crosses with the soft varieties and the lowest percentage in the crosses involving T. persicum. Of the Agropyron species, A. glaucum gave the lowest set when crossed with the wheats, and A. elongatum the highest. On back-crossing the hybrids from soft and hard wheats crossed with A. intermedium, to counteract the F 1sterility, the best set was obtained with soft wheat pollen, i.e. from 1.5 to 6.1%, while the corresponding figures for the hard wheats were 0.2 to 0.9%. Under the conditions at the station all Agropyron species (except the local ones) comprised winter, semi-winter and spring forms. The local types and A. elongatum were very winter-hardy and the latter species had the longest vernalization stage. The Agropyron species varied in the length of the second stage. The F 1 intergeneric hybrids were perennial forms of marked vigour. The F 1 from the crosses between autumn wheats and the local Agropyron were the most winter hardy, while the F 1 hybrids from the combination of autumn wheats with A. glaucum were the least so, the percentage that survived the winter being 65.8% for the former and 29.2% for the latter. Figures for the F 3 and F 4 generations show that, with few exceptions, crosses between spring wheats and the various Agropyron species used did not produce winter hardy forms. In 1940, 57 of the best F 4 strains superior to the standard Lutescens 1060/10 in various economic features were sown in the nursery. Some of them were perennial and showed high tillering capacity and a cultivated type of ear and grain and good threshing qualities, as well as being resistant to fungous diseases. In addition, 158 superior clones were chosen for their potential value in the breeding of perennial wheats. Hybrids between wheats and local Agropyron forms deserve attention for their drought resistance.","1941","2015-06-01 17:56:22","2015-06-01 17:56:22","","99-100","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19441601199","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifteen growing crossbred heifers (JerseyxRed Sindhi) of between 7-10 months age and pre-trial average body weight of 49-50 kg were divided on the basis of weight in to three treatment groups viz. T-1-hybrid sorghum+soybean, T-2-setaria+soybean and T-3-hybrid napier+soybean in a completely randomized block design. Intercropped forages were harvested fresh, chaffed and mixed before they were offered to the heifers. Chemical composition of the herbage, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight gain and nutrient digestibility co-efficients were estimated. The herbage mixtures had crude protein (CP) content in the range of 11.87 to 13.86% and ether extract (EE) contents were 2.91 to 3.11%, respectively. The herbage mixtures were rich in minerals (ash). The gross energy (kcal/g DM) was higher in hybrid napier+soybean, while hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had lower value for gross energy. The hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had higher contents of NDF, ADF, cellulose, lignin and silica as compared to that of hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. The heifers fed hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture had significantly (p<0.05) higher DMI g/kg W-0.75 (97.41 +/- 4.34) as compared to hybrid sorghum+soybean (88.31 +/- 2.66) and setaria+soybean (79.29 +/- 1.06) herbage mixtures. Nutrients digestibility, DCP percent, DCP intake and nitrogen balance were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the heifers fed on hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. There was a significant (p<0.05) difference among different herbage mixtures in TDN. The heifers on setaria+soybean herbage mixture had lower average body weight gain (g/day) than those on hybrid sorghum+soybean and hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixtures. Data obtained in this experiment demonstrated that herbage mixture of hybrid napier+soybean was better than hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures in the nutrition of growing heifers. It had highest nutritive value, batter digestibility co-efficients which showed better growth rate and higher feed efficiency. In ranking, hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture was better followed by hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean in nutritive value in the parameters studied. For future wasteland development program in humid-sub tropics of Himachal Pradesh hybrid napier and its intercropping with soybean is recommended for general adoption because of its better adaptability and higher nutritive value.","2002","2015-06-01 20:42:01","2015-06-02 01:16:43","","1754-1759","","12","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Cattle; Chemical composition; Digestibility; DMI; Feed Efficiency; Growth Rate; Intercropping; Perennial Grasses; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench] is a versatile feed grain crop which can be grown in multiple-cropping systems employed in the Southeastern USA. Two trials were conducted to compare the feeding value of either high- (Ht; bird-resistant) or low-tannin (Lt; non-bird-resistant) grain sorghum from early, ratoon (regrowth), or late crops when used as the primary energy source in diets for young swine. Each trial was a 2 X 3 factorial design and each involved 144 young pigs (Sus scrota domesticus) (17 lb average initial weight). Both trials were similar but each used grain from a different cropping year. For each year, the early crops (Lt and Ht) were planted in April and harvested in August. The early crop plants were then cut back after harvest with the ratoon (regrowth) crops harvested in December. The late crops were planted in July and harvested in December. The level of grain sorghum in the diet was constant across treatments and pigs were fed the diets (0.97% lysine) for 30-d. Rate of gain, daily feed intake, and feed-to-gain ratio were measured as a means to assess comparative feed value of the grain sorghums. An indigestible marker (chromic oxide) procedure was used to determine apparent dry matter (DM) and N digestibilities of the diets. In general, crude protein and crude fiber contents and content of most amino acids, including lysine, tended to be higher and grain test weight lower for the four ratoon crops (2 hybrids, 2 yr) than for the four early- or four late-planted crops. Nutrient composition, test weight, and tannin concentration tended to vary more among the ratoon crops. Pig average daily gain was not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary grain sorghum crop type (early, ratoon, or late) or grain hybrid (Lt or Ht). Ht grain diets resulted in poorer (P < 0.01) feed-to-gain ratio and N and DM digestibilities than Lt diets. Significant interactions included hybrid X crop type X crop year (trial) (P < 0.5) for feed-to-gain ratio and DM and N digestibilities; crop type X crop year (P < 0.01) for DM digestibility; and hybrid X crop type (P < 0.05) for N digestibility. Ratoon crops, in particular Ht ratoon crops, of grain sorghum showed more evidence of year-to-year variation in feeding value for young swine than early-planted or late-planted crops.","April 1990","2015-06-01 20:03:17","2015-06-02 01:17:19","","228-232","","2","3","","Journal of production agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); TX (ratoon* N5 sorghum); WOS","hybrids; nutrient content; nutritive value; regrowth; Sorghum bicolor; sowing date; swine; tannins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional pixel-based analysis of remotely sensed data results in inaccurate identification of some crops due to pixel heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability. These problems can be overcome using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, which incorporate new spectral, textural and hierarchical features after segmentation of imagery. We combined OBIA and decision tree (DT) algorithms to develop a methodology, named Object-based Crop Identification and Mapping (OCIM), for a multi-seasonal assessment of a large number of crop types and field status. In our approach, we explored several vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features derived from visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER satellite scenes collected during three distinct growing-season periods (mid-spring, early-summer and late-summer). OCIM was developed for 13 major crops cultivated in the agricultural area of Yolo County in California, USA. The model design was built in four different scenarios (combinations of three or two periods) by using two independent training and validation datasets and the best DTs resulted in an error rate of 9% for the three-period model and between 12 and 16% for the two-period models. Next, the selected DT was used for the thematic classification of the entire cropland area and mapping was then evaluated applying the confusion matrix method to the independent testing dataset that reported 79% overall accuracy. OCIM detected intra-class variations in most crops attributed to variability from local crop calendars, tree-orchard structures and land management operations. Spectral variables (based on VIs) contributed around 90% to the models, although textural variables were necessary to discriminate between most of the permanent crop-fields (orchards, vineyard, alfalfa and meadow). Features extracted from late-summer imagery contributed around 60% in classification model development, whereas mid-spring and early-summer imagery contributed around 30 and 10%, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the main groups of crops based on the presence and vigor of green vegetation within the fields, contributing around 50% to the models. In addition, other VIs based on SWIR bands were also crucial to crop identification because of their potential to detect field properties like moisture, vegetation vigor, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil. The OCIM method was built using interpretable rules based on physical properties of the crops studied and it was successful for object-based feature selection and crop identification.","June 15, 2011","2015-06-01 19:23:31","2015-06-01 19:23:31","","1301-1316","","6","115","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture; ASTER; Decision tree; Field-scale; OBIA; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Spectral and textural features; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At anaphase, chromosomes showed a normal segregation of 7 chromosomes to each pole in 87.61% of the cells. At the end of regular meiotic division, normal pollen grains had been produced and the fertility was found to be high. In tetraploid material at diakinesis and metaphase I, in addition to quadrivalents were found bivalents and univalent and trivalents were observed in metaphase cells. In the tetraoloid material, 39.6% of anaphase cells were found to be divided into 14 chromosomes to each pole.

The main objective of the study was to enhance the crop productivity on ravinous land with different on farm activities based on rain water management. Twenty five check dams were constructed earlier in the entire project area on down stream of nalas. The catchment area of these nalas bunds is about 200 ha and 20 hectometer surface water is arrested in these check dams every year, which was exploited for irrigation on 190 ha land. The mini earthen store reservoir in the form of contour bunds, submergence bunds, water harvesting bundhies, land levelling & smoothening and vegetative barrier, which were earlier formed also help in harvesting the maximum rain water under dry environment. The arrested rain water and run off control have helped in improvement of ground water table, which has risen to the extent of 3.85 m over the base year. The cropping systems followed in catchments area of check dams gave system productivity as 47.94 q/ha in sesamum-pea, 42.00 q/ha in sesamum-gram, 37.52 q/ha in sesamum-mustard and 72.48 q/ha in black gram-wheat, which was higher over the farmers practices. The cultivation on contour alignment gave system productivity of sesamum-pea by 37.41 q/ha, sesamum-gram by 34.86 q/ha, sesamum-mustard by 32.89 q/ha and black gram-wheat by 54.28 q/ha. The long duration pigeon pea raised in submergence bunding gave yield of 22.00 q/ha, which was higher over farmers practices (19.50 q/ha).

Perennial wheat responds much more strongly to organic fertilizer than annual spring wheat because of its greater ability to form roots under these conditions. Size of mature plant and yield of grain were likewise highest with peat-manure-NPK. Growth was strongly depressed on soil made acid with H2SO4, and was best on soil made alkaline to pH 7.17 with Ca(0H)2. Plants grown in Helregel's culture solution grew slightly better with the addition of 0.04% NaCl, and were able to reach maturity and form seeds when 0.35% NaCl was added. At this concn., seedlings of the spring wheat Caesium 0111 grew very poorly and died before reaching the stage of flowering.

In T. tubalicum, 5-21% of the ovules are defective and apomixis is frequent, which suggests it may be an amphidiploid. Pollination of T. palaeocolchicum (2 n = 28) by a perennial rye derived from winter rye x Secale montanum gave a set of 367 grains from 858 florets pollinated. The hybrids varied in fertility and their grains differed in size; some gave rise to segregating hybrids whereas others, mostly large and well developed grains formed on plants with low fertility, produced fertile, true-breeding plants assumed to be amphidiploids arising by pseudogamy; these resembled T. tubalicum in ear characters. Tabular data on content of trifructosan in 11 Triticum species, the amphidiploid, two rye species and Aegilops squarrosa show much higher values in rye and T. tubalicum than in other wheat species; relatively high values were found also in T. spelta, T. palaeocolchicum and the amphidiploid. It is thought probable that T. tubalicum arose from crosses of T. palaeocolchicum with a weed rye and is the earliest known Triticale; it would therefore have the genome structure AABBRR whereas T. imereticum has AABBCC [cf.

M.","On the ways towards perennial wheat.","Sotsialisticheskoe Zernovoe Khozyaistvo","","","","","Reference is made to the numerous useful qualities in the three species of Agropyrum that cross with wheat and which it would be desirable to introduce into wheat, for instance resistance to drought, cold, salty soil and various diseases, vigourous growth and lastly the perennial habit. The success of crossing depends very largely on the choice of parental strains, the success in different combinations varying from 7-10 to 90 or more per cent. The fertility of the F 1 hybrids also varies, being highest in some combinations of Triticum vulgare x A. elongatum. Thus as many as 3000 grains were obtained from seven plants of the wheat Sarrosa x A. elongatum, whilst from another T. vulgare with the same species of Agropyrum only 14, 000 grains were obtained from 2000 plants. Even different plants in the same F 1 vary in fertility. Great variations in fertility, as well as in all other characters, occur in the later generations. These, mainly obtained by back-crossing with wheat in the crosses with A. trichophorum and A. intermedium, contain less and less perennial forms, though the expression of this character varies with growth conditions, being more pronounced in the greenhouse than in the field. The later generations of the cross with A, elongatum, being largely obtained by selfing, contain many more perennial forms, sometimes up to 90 per cent, and in other ways more nearly resemble the Agropyrum parent. One constant perennial line was isolated from this cross in 1934 and is described and illustrated. It has an ear intermediate in type and small grain of the wheat type. Thus the possibility of obtaining true-breeding perennial lines from the cross has been demonstrated and it only remains now to isolate a form of higher quality. Many of the annual forms are also of exceptional interest for breeding, being distinguished by productivity, good vitreous grain, and complete resistance to rust and smut and this part of the problem can definitely be said to have been achieved. The high degree of pairing in the hybrids, where up to 21 bivalents have been observed, indicates the close relationship between the two genera. This supports the hope that the desired combinations will be attained, and suggests that the genus Agropyrum may contain the ancestors of the genus Triticum, in which case such crosses as these gain enormously in importance.","1935","2015-06-01 17:57:34","2015-06-01 17:57:34","","77-83","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19361600832","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most work has focused on placement, form, and timing of applied N to reduce losses from volatilization and denitrification. In contrast, less emphasis has been given to development of methods to adjust N rates in relation to the amount of N supplied by indigenous soil resources. As a result, N fertilizer recommendations are typically made for districts or regions with the implicit assumption that soil N supply is relatively uniform within these domains. Recent studies, however, document tremendous variation in soil N supply among lowland rice fields with similar soil types or in the same field over time. Despite these differences, rice farmers do not adjust applied N rates to account for the wide range in soil N supply, and the resulting imbalance contributes to low N-use efficiency. A model for calculating N-use efficiency is proposed that explicitly accounts for contributions from both indigenous and applied N to plant uptake and yield. We argue that increased N-use efficiency will depend on field-specific N management tactics that are responsive to soil N supply and plant N status. N fertilizer losses are thus considered a symptom of incongruence between N supply and crop demand rather than a driving force of N efficiency. Recent knowledge of process controls on N cycling, microbial populations, and soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition in flooded soils are discussed in relation to N-use efficiency. We conclude that the intrinsic capacity of wetland rice systems to conserve N and the rapid N uptake potential of the rice plant provide opportunities for significant increases in N efficiency by improved management and monitoring of indigenous N resources, straw residues, plant N status, and N fertilizer.","March 1998","2015-06-01 19:38:28","2015-06-01 19:38:28","","7-39","","1–2","56","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropping systems; Fertilizer management; Nitrogen accumulation; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Nutrient-use efficiency; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil organic matter; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The belated Neolithic opens up with extralocal crops domesticated elsewhere. Evidence is now forthcoming of the antiquity of the Neolithic with the local crop rice but its origin remains unknown. Evidence from the Mesolithic reveals that, as elsewhere, the animal domestication had preceded the plant domestication. Howsoever uncertain the evidence is, it does indicate the possibility of the occurrence of such wild grasses which are today the forgotten cereals and are cultivated by the tribals. The extralocal crops which entered the extreme northwest of the sub-continent were diffused among diverse and contemporaneous cultures from the west to the east and subsequently from the north to Maharashtra. Rice entered the wheat-barley and/or millet-based economy from the north (Ganga Plains) to the south subsequent to the diffusion of wheat and barley, and entered the deep south during the Iron Age, during which its cultivation had expanded into the rest of the sub-continent. Both cultivation and exploitation of wild plant life went on side by side. Dolichos biflorus and Paspalum scrobiculatum appear to have been domesticated in Neolithic and post-Neolithic times.","January 1978","2015-06-01 19:25:37","2015-06-01 19:25:37","","31-36","","1","7","","Journal of Human Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cultivated plants; history; Indian sub-continent; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"8IVVBCU8","journalArticle","1991","MARYUSHKINA, VY","PECULIARITIES OF COMMON RAGWEED (AMBROSIA-ARTEMISIIFOLIA L) STRATEGY","Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment","","0167-8809","10.1016/0167-8809(91)90018-S","","The strategy of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) has been analysed by comparing its position in five phytocenoses of the steppe zone of the Ukraine: weedy-fallow, agrocenoses of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), perennial grass mixture (Bromus inermis Medicago sativa + Onobrychis viciifolia) and a pasture community. Data were processed by direct gradient analysis along the axis of the foliar cover of common ragweed. An experiment was conducted in a freshly ploughed abandoned field with and without the manual removal of the common ragweed seedlings. Such removal imitated seedling extermination by the ragweed leaf beetle (Zygogramma suturalis F., Coleoptera, Chryzomelidae). The influence of common ragweed on the rate of progressive abandoned field succession was studied. If the foliar cover of common ragweed is high (greater-than-or-equal-to 30%), then it suppresses the local weed species in annual crop and weedy-fallow communities. Common ragweed is suppressed by perennial grasses in a perennial grass mixture and in pasture communities. Common ragweed strongly inhibits progressive succession by suppressing both annual and perennial species, and thus decreasing the species diversity of communities. Thus, during spontaneous introduction under the break of consortive relations, a peculiar 'drift' of common ragweed from the R-strategy towards the K-strategy occurs. Adventization of communities under anthropogenic action may be decreased by limiting introduction from other regions. Conversely, phytocenotic control of ragweed numbers by creating artificial phytocenoses of perennial grasses is appropriate for areas of adventitious species distribution. Reintroduction of local natural species, as well as increasing the number of reserves for the preservation of groups of these plants, are also expedient for increasing the buffer properties of anthropogenically controlled landscapes.","AUG  1991","2015-06-01 17:48:36","2015-06-01 17:48:36","","207-216","","3-4","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1991GE50600009","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to assess their capacity to regrow post-harvest and yield grain over successive years, and thereby identify characteristics common to the surviving breeding lines. Over the 3-year experimental period 61% of the 176 experimental entries demonstrated some capacity for post-harvest regrowth. Of 125 entries planted in the first two years of experimentation, 34% persisted to produce a second grain harvest in year 2. Three entries from 73 planted in 2008 persisted to produce grain in 3 successive years. In a subset of 87 entries that underwent cytogenetic analysis there was an association between regrowth ability and the presence of at least one whole genome equivalent (14 chromosomes) from the perennial donor species. If the wheat parent was a hexaploid (2n = 42), an entry required at least 56 chromosomes to achieve any substantial post-harvest regrowth. However, the presence of 56 chromosomes was no guarantee of a capacity to survive post-harvest. The morphology of the hybrid germplasm was highly variable for every trait assessed including grain yield, grain size, grain quality, harvest index, tiller height and head morphology; reflective of the diversity of pedigrees. Narrower kernels appeared to be associated with higher grain protein concentrations. Unextractable polymeric protein (UPP) correlates with rheological properties of the doughs; some of the experimental entries had very low UPP; the majority had high UPP suggesting useful flour, dough and baking properties. A high level of disease resistance was observed in the subset of entries tested for leaf, stem and stripe rust as well as wheat streak mosaic virus, indicating that further development of hybrid germplasm would be unlikely to pose an unacceptable disease threat to conventional cereal crops, particularly where amphiploids were deployed. The variability of the cohort and the presence of entries with desirable agronomic and grain quality attributes suggested a potential to breed and select for perennial wheat derivatives with commercially desirable characteristics.","2012","2015-06-01 20:42:43","2015-06-02 01:19:07","","68-89","","","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Intermediate wheatgrass; perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat); Perennial wheat; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; Tall wheatgrass; Thinopyrum elongatum; Thinopyrum intermedium; Thinopyrum ponticum; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","breeding lines; chromosomes; cytogenetic analysis; disease resistance; dough; field experimentation; flour; genome; germplasm; grain crops; grain protein; grain yield; harvest index; harvesting; hybrids; leaves; parents; pedigree; proteins; regrowth; rheological properties; seeds; stem rust; tillers; wheat; Wheat streak mosaic virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first Canadian cultivar of this crop (AC E-1), tested as LRC 96-1, was released in 2001 to a seed company for multiplication and distribution. Seed for commercial forage production is expected to be available in 2003. AC E-1 will have the distinction of being the first North American cultivar of PC Rye and the only perennial cereal crop specifically developed for forage production. PC Rye was originally developed in Germany by crossing Rye ( Secale cereale) with a Perennial Wild Rye ( Secale montanum). AC E-1 PC Rye has survived and produced economic amounts of biomass for four years under southern Alberta growing conditions. It has the ability to produce an amount and quality of silage similar to barley, which is grown extensively in the Canadian prairies for the purpose. Grazing studies with AC E-1 have shown that the crop can be used for grazing during its early stages of growth with good results. However, it produces less seed than the fall rye cultivars grown in the area and the seed heads are susceptible to ergot infection. Its poor seed yield and susceptibility to ergot may be due to a high proportion of sterile seed heads, the main drawback of this cultivar. Although ergot susceptibility is not a major concern for a silage crop, research at Lethbridge is directed towards improving seed head fertility of this crop, which will have a positive impact on its seed yield. This review deals with the historical background of this crop, present status, and our efforts to improve it.","2001","2015-06-01 17:31:07","2015-06-01 17:31:07","","13-19","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20013167250","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S.","Perennial grain crops: A synthesis of ecology and plant breeding","Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems","","1742-1705","10.1079/RAF200496","","Perennial grain crops would address many agricultural problems, including soil erosion, nutrient loss and pesticide contamination. Doubts about the possibility of perennial grain crops rest upon two assumptions: (1) that the relationship between yield and longevity is a fixed function that cannot be influenced by selection, mutation or environmental changes; and (2) that yield and longevity trade off in a bivariate manner to the exclusion of all other traits. These assumptions are consistent with the phenotypic trade-off model, but recent research suggests that a quantitative genetic model is a more appropriate approach to trade-offs. In the quantitative genetic model, environmental and genetic changes can result in increases in two traits simultaneously even when a trade-off, or negative correlation, exists between the two traits. Empirical evidence that the trade-off between perenniality and reproductive allocation is not fixed comes from wild, herbaceous perennials that can produce more than 2000 kg seed ha(-1) in the temperate zone, and herbaceous perennial crops that produce on average 8900 kg fruit ha(-1) in the tropics. Ecological literature suggests that most perennials produce small amounts of seed relative to their vegetative growth not as a physiological absolute, but rather as a result of natural selection in a stable, competitive environment favoring longevity. By selecting strongly for seed yield in a population of perennial plants, the plant breeder can likely achieve that which is rare in nature-a high seed-yielding perennial plant. The same general methodologies that have allowed annual grain breeders to increase grain yield and push many combinations of negatively correlated traits to levels of expression not seen in nature are available to the perennial grain breeder. Perennial,rain breeders are integrating ecological principles and traditional plant breeding methods in their efforts to develop perennial grain wheat (Triticum spp.), sorghum (Sorghum spp.), sunflower (Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) and rice (Oryza spp.).","MAR  2005","2015-06-01 17:18:44","2015-06-02 01:19:15","","5-14","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000229467200004","","","","search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, efforts to develop perennial grain crops which were initiated during the 20th century are discussed. These include attempts by the Soviets and Europeans to perennialize annual grains such as wheat and rye. More recently, efforts in the U.S. inspired by the publication of Dr. Wes Jackson's book, New Roots for Agriculture,1,2 have focused upon the domestication of perennial grass species.

Its multiple uses include food, fodder, manure and firewood. Data on perennial pigeonpea, together with relevant information on shorter-duration genotypes, are reviewed in this paper. Growth of perennial pigeonpea, like that of medium-duration grain types (150 to 190 days) in intercropping systems with cereals, is slow during the first 3 to 4 months. Therefore, it requires minimum sacrifice in terms of yield of annual crops in the system during the first year and offers many of the benefits of tree species in subsequent years. Total dry matter production potential of perennial pigeonpea in peninsular India is more than 15 t ha-1 year-1 consisting of about 2.0 t of grain, 3.0 t of leaf litter, 9.0 t of stems and 1.0 t of residue made up of podwalls and twigs. In addition, pigeonpea improves soil fertility by nutrient cycling and biological nitrogen fixation. Susceptibility of pigeonpea to diseases and negative effects on growth of annual crops are the potential constraints in the semi-arid tropics. Some pertinent areas for further research are proposed.","1990","2015-06-01 20:25:10","2015-06-02 02:00:05","","113-129","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Agroforestry; fodder; genotype; Grain yield; Perennial pigeonpea; Scopus; search.grain; search.pigeonpea; Soil fertility; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent statistics show that an additional 40 million hectares of rice paddy is needed to increase rice production to 118 million tons by 2035, a figure that is more than double the current rice production. Every year, rice is planted in approximately 14 million hectares of upland areas. Current benchmark yields of annual upland rice are lower than 1 t/ha. If upland rice yield can be increased to 3-4 t/ha, a reasonable yield under barren and infertile soil conditions, 40 Mt of rice can easily be secured. Traditionally, the uplands suffer from drought, infertile soils, weed infestation and plant diseases. Compounding these problems is the continuous erosion and degradation of upland soils due to agricultural use. A practical solution to these problems would be to breed and cultivate perennial upland rice that would not have to be planted annually. Not only would perennial upland rice reduce soil erosion by providing permanent groundcover. It would also improve the sustainability of the uplands for agricultural use and lower the annual inputs related to field operations, thus increasing the income of farmers.","2012","2015-06-01 17:26:23","2015-06-01 17:26:23","","191-201","","2","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20133031489","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Africa, the most important is Oryzae barthii. which comprises several vars. This sp. is widely distributed over the Egyptian Sudan, Tanganyika, the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, and French Guinea. It multiplies by seed, rhizomes, and short pieces of culms. Its persistence in nature is due mainly to reproduction by rhizomes, which are drought-resistant and resume growth with the first rain after the 7-mo's. dry season; 4 or 5 generations of tillers may come from one rhizome. The distribution of the species is controlled largely by the duration of soil inundation; it is absent from areas continuously under water. It is somewhat salt-tolerant, being found in soils with a content of NaCl up to 840 ppm. The potential economic uses of O. barthii are varied; the foliage is excellent for green forage, and suitable as hay for cattle and sheep. The straw can be used in the manufacture of paper. The grain is excellent for human consumption and has the desirable feature of a white pericarp. The main obstacles ot its domestication are its irregularity in date of ripening and low yield. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R. W.

I.","Perennial varieties of cultivated plants.","Novoe v Sel'skom Khozyaistve","","","","","The advantages of the perennial types which are found in related species of so many of the main crop plants are enumerated, these being largely associated with their greater vigour and yield, hardiness, disease and drought resistance and their considerably earlier maturity in the second and later years of vegetation; it is thus often possible to get more than one crop per year. In crossing wheat with perennial rye the best results have been obtained with ryes from Armenia-the hybrids from these forms were more fertile and gave a more fertile back-cross progeny than any others; this is ascribed to the fact that these forms have for thousands of years been growing in similar climatic conditions to the wheats, as a result of which ""their chromatin has become more similar"", owing to natural selection of a similar ecological type. Wheat is also being crossed extensively with Agropyrum and with perennial rye. Of the latter over 200 different parental combinations have been made, in which an average success of 70 per cent was observed. The most successful of all the combinations was leucurum 1364/1 x Secale moniamtm (Kat. 8) from Armenia which cross was made in 1933 and has now produced a fertile perennial T. durum, in which the yield and grain weight were superior to those of the standard varieties but the ear is unfortunately brittle. Hybrids of this form with standard wheat varieties have a tough rachis and it is thought probable that perennial tough forms will be obtained in the second or third generation. The hybrids are resistant to brown rust and quite immune to stem and yellow rust. New stems are formed after harvest and in 1936 these attained a height of 40-50 cm. and were cut for hay, and in 10-15 of the hybrids they produced a second crop of grain 50-60 per cent the size of the first, 15 to 24 grains being produced per ear, with a. 1, 000-corn weight of 35 grm. By suitable cultural treatments this second yield could be brought up to that of the first. Similar crosses are being made between perennial and cultivated rye, sunflower with Helianthus maximiliani and H. rigidus and cultivated sorghum with S. halepense and several perennial leguminous species are being crossed with the allied cultivated forms.","1937","2015-06-01 17:39:33","2015-06-02 01:20:29","","44 pp.-44 pp.","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19381601132","","","","search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are also potential direct production benefits from reduced external inputs, providing extra grazing for livestock in mixed farming systems, as well as benefits for whole-farm management which may offset lower grain yields. In addition to universal issues of domestication and breeding of perennial wheat, specific challenges for perennial wheat in Australia's dryland systems will include tolerance of water deficit and poor soil environments, and the risks of hosting foliar pathogens over summer. Temperate perennial forage grasses could indicate the potential distribution and traits required in perennial wheat adapted to more arid environments (e.g. summer dormancy). Several Australian native and exotic perennial relatives of wheat could also provide sources of disease resistance, and tolerance of soil acidity, drought, salinity and waterlogging. Still, several farming systems could accommodate perennial wheat with inconsistent persistence in some environments. While developing perennial wheat will be challenging, there is significant opportunity in Australia for perennial wheat to diversify current cropping options. The risks may be minimised by staged investment and interim products with some immediate applications could be produced along the way.","2010","2015-06-01 17:46:26","2015-06-02 01:20:40","","679-690","","9","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000281628100001","","","","AGRICOLA; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","arid lands; Australia; carbon; disease resistance; domestication; dormancy; drought; edaphic factors; farming systems; flooded conditions; forage grasses; grain yield; mixed grazing; pathogens; production technology; risk; salinity; soil erosion; soil pH; soil quality; soil water deficit; summer; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using classical breeding methods, new types of wheat have been developed that maintain the key characteristics of annual wheat, but continue to grow after harvest. Following dormancy in the winter, growth is initiated from the roots or crowns in the spring, allowing a crop to be harvested every fall. By retaining constant soil cover over multiple years, wind and water erosion would be dramatically reduced. In addition, the costs associated with annual seeding and tillage would be minimized, and unlike many reduced tillage systems, it is expected that standard seeding equipment would be suitable for stand establishment. Other potential benefits of perennial wheat include improved wildlife habitat, more efficient use of available water, provision of a potent carbon sink, and the possibility of integrating straw retrieval into a small grains cropping system. Past attempts in the first half of the last century failed to develop perennial wheat as a viable crop, primarily because of low yields, and the research was ultimately abandoned. Perrennial wheat production may now be viewed as acceptable for highly erodible land or for obtaining carbon sequestration credits. This paper presents an overview of solutions to the obstacles encountered by previous researchers, introduces some of the newly developed perennial wheat lines, and discusses considerations for management practices.","2001","2015-06-01 20:43:39","2015-06-02 01:21:14","","147-151","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Carbon sequestration; Cereal grains; Conservation reserve program; Crop cover; No-till agriculture; plant breeding; Scopus; search.wheat; soil erosion control; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); TX (perennial N1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","annuals; crop management; cropping systems; crown; dormancy; habitats; no-tillage; Pacific States; perennials; roots; soil degradation; soil erosion; Triticum aestivum; wildlife","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the bunds with moderate and limited water supply, iron deficiency adversely affected ratoon performance moderately and severely, respectively. None of the ratoons lodged due to the frequent occurrence of extremely strong typhoons. The potentials of continuous ratooning (twice) appeared encouraging with very good water supply based on the performance of two early maturing varieties. The second ratoon had much higher yields and better grain characteristics than those of the first ratoon thus best demonstrating the feasibility of having a good ratoon only under adequate or abundant water supply condition where favorable crop nutritional factors apparently exist Also, the presence of a high proportion of basal tillers might have somehow contributed to better anchorage and non-lodging tendency of the ratoons particularly under abundant water supply condition. The superior yielding selections found highly suitable both for dry-seeding and ratooning purposes generally exhibited such agronomic traits as being medium late maturing, relatively short statured, very high in tillering and panicle producing abilities, slightly lodging or non-lodging, average-sized in panicles and grains and having a high degree of tolerance to drought and iron deficiency. A ratoon crop appeared to have several advantages over a succeeding newly-established transplanted crop such as the elimination of the turn-around period and transplanting material and labour inputs, much reduced fertilizer input, extra-ordinary lodging resistance and much shortened growth duration.","1979","2015-06-01 18:41:09","2015-06-01 18:41:09","","95-101","","2/3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093019620","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench] in the field. In efforts to build simulation models of ratoon grain sorghum, modellers have assumed that the planted and ratoon crops grow similarily. This study was undertaken to document the growth of ratoon grain sorghum and test the hypothesis that growth and development of the ratoon crop is similar to the planted crop. Experiments were conducted from 1985 through 1987 under irrigated field conditions using nine hybrids of medium/medium-late maturity on a Houston Black clay: fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellustert. In two of the three years, grain-yield of the planted crop exceeded the ratoon while grain-yield was equal in the other year studied. Rapid development of tillers produced much higher leaf-area indexes (L) and vegetative biomass early in the plant's ontogeny for the ratoon compared to the planted crop. Depending on hybrid and year, each primary shoot (PS) of the planted crop produced from 4 to 7 tillers within 20 days of harvest of the planted crop. At harvest, however, only 2–3 tillers/PS remained and only 1.7 tillers/PS (on average) produced grain. The planted crop allocated a higher proportion of its total above-ground biomass to grain than did the ratoon crop. Differences in the degree of tillering and partitioning of biomass to grain were found among hybrids. Yet, a significant hybrid×year interaction suggests that partitioning was dependent on the environment. Phenology of planted and ratoon crops were similar. Grain-forming tillers produced the same number of leaves as the primary shoot of the planted crop, and differences in time to anthesis between the planted and ratoon crops averaged approximately 100 of the 1000 heat units (7°C base temperature). Based on our observations, the assumption that growth of planted and ratoon grain sorghum are similar appears to be in error. However, the phenology of grain-forming ratoon tillers appeared to mimic the phenology of the planted crop's primary shoot.","June 1990","2015-06-01 19:39:54","2015-06-02 01:29:33","","205-219","","3–4","23","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 sorghum; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting hydroxycinnamic acids and esters are amplified in several cascades by a combination of reductases, oxygenases, and transferases to result in an organ and developmentally specific pattern of metabolites, characteristic for each plant species. During the last decade, methodology driven targeted and non-targeted approaches in several plant species have enabled the identification of the participating enzymes of this complex biosynthetic machinery, and revealed numerous genes, enzymes, and metabolites essential for regulation and compartmentation. Considerable success in structural and computational biology, combined with the analytical sensitivity to detect even trace compounds and smallest changes in the metabolite, transcript, or enzyme pattern, has facilitated progress towards a comprehensive view of the plant response to its biotic and abiotic environment. Transgenic approaches have been used to reveal insights into an apparently redundant gene and enzyme pattern required for functional integrity and plasticity of the various phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways. Nevertheless, the function and impact of all members of a gene family remain to be completely established. This review aims to give an update on the various facets of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, which is not only restricted to common lignin or flavonoid biosynthesis, but feeds into a variety of other aromatic metabolites like coumarins, phenolic volatiles, or hydrolyzable tannins.","January 2010","2015-06-01 19:24:37","2015-06-01 19:24:37","","2-20","","1","3","","Molecular Plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","anthocyanin; biosynthetic pathway; coumarin; flavonoid; lignin; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Phenylpropanoid; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; tannin; volatiles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These provide novel contexts in which to study source vs. sink limitations of plant productivity. This is one of the first investigations of source: sink effects on photosynthesis, seed size, and regrowth in perennial cereal crops as well as in the commercially important annual rye (Secale cereale L.). Through experimental manipulations of field-grown plants, we studied the effect of manipulations of source: sink ratio (25% decreases and 100% increases) on photosynthetic rate in perennial wheat [Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. R. Dewey], perennial rye [S. cereale x Secale strictum (C. Presl) C. Presl subsp. strictum (syn. Secale mon-tanum Guss.)], annual wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and annual rye. We measured carbohydrate pools, seed size, and regrowth as further indices of source vs. sink limitation. Perennial wheat showed sink limitation throughout. Annual and perennial rye appeared to be colimited. Low source: sink ratios in perennial wheat and rye were associated with up to 25% higher photosynthetic rates while high source: sink ratios led to up to 20% decreases. Seed size showed more stability under source: sink manipulation in perennials than in annuals while regrowth of perennials was not affected by source sink ratio, and all three species showed more stability of seed size in response to source: sink manipulation than annual wheat. Our results are consistent with perennial cereals operating below their maximum photosynthetic capacity, in contrast to annual wheat, and following a conservative reproductive strategy. By selecting for greater sink strength in perennial wheat, breeders may be able to achieve higher rates of photosynthesis and support higher yields in this new crop.","2014","2015-06-01 20:42:29","2015-06-02 01:30:03","","274-283","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We fully reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of AA- genome species with confidence. Oryza meridionalis, native to Australia, is found to be the earliest divergent lineage around 2.93 mya, whereas O. punctata, a BB- genome species, serves as the best outgroup to distinguish their phylogenetic relationships. They separated from O. punctata approximately 9.11 mya during the Miocene epoch, and subsequently radiated to generate the entire AA- genome lineage diversity.

The plant suffered a &gt;50% reduction in fresh biomass when exposed to a butachlor dose of 5 mg L−1. However, a significant further biomass reduction only occurred when the dosage level of butachlor was increased to 40 mg L−1. The root was more sensitive than the shoot to butachlor toxicity. It appears that the inhibition of fine root development under butachlor stress was the upstream cause for the retarded plant growth. A butachlor dose of 5 mg L−1 was sufficiently high to cause significant H2O2-induced oxidative damage in the plant cells, as indicated by the increased MDA and the lower production rate relative to consumption rate of CAT.

Moench] varieties to salinity and irrigation frequency were studied from January to December 2009. Two salt tolerant varieties of forage sorghum namely Speedfeed and KFS4 were grown under salinity levels of 0, 5, 10, 15 dS m -1 and irrigated when the leaf water potential reached -1(control), -1.5 and -2 MPa. Salinity and irrigation frequency significantly (P≤0.01) affected leaf water potential, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and stomatal size. Though both varieties were sensitive to salt and water deficit the KFS4 variety had 10.7, 8.2, 6.1 and 4 percent higher leaf water potential, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, respectively compared to Speedfeed, hence KFS4 is more tolerant to stress conditions compared to Speedfeed. Combination effect of high salinity and low water availability had an adverse effect on stomatal conductance. When irrigation was delayed from the leaf's water potential of -1 to -2 MPa, the chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were decreased by 26.8, 10.1 and 28% respectively. The highly significant declined was mostly at -2 MPa irrigation frequencies, it means irrigation of forage sorghum can be delayed till leaf water potential reaches to -1.5 MPa, which takes about two weeks time. The number of stomata and the size of their apertures determine the extent of gaseous exchange and hence the photosynthetic potential. The number and dimension were less in the treated plants.","2014","2015-06-01 19:08:08","2015-06-01 19:08:08","","2277-2289","","16","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20143228439","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its growth and development are affected by the environment factors and the growth condition of the main crop. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different cultivations (DS: direct-seeding, ST: seedling-throwing, TP: transplanting) and planting periods of the main crop on physiological traits and rice yields, as well as to find the source of the nutrients in the ratoon crop by studying the stubble dry matter and nitrogen translocation of pre-anthesis and its efficiency in the ratoon crop. The yields of the main crop were different significantly. The yield of TP was significantly higher than ST and DS as well as the yield of D3 was more than the yields of other periods. In the ratoon crop, the yield of D1 was more than that in other periods. The ratooning ability was different significantly among different cultivations. The cultivations affected the tillering ability in the ratoon crop and the translocation of the stubble dry matter and nitrogen uptaking in which TP was better than others. From March to April, sowing or transplanting date did not affect the stubble dry matter and N translocation of pre-anthesis and its efficiency.

Nitrogen balance in a paddy-field water-purifying system in which cattle feces were applied was studied for 4 years to assess the suitability of the system for a subtropical area, Japan. Three successive harvestings using ratoon of forage rice following one rice transplanting were conducted with chemical fertilizer and high and low rates of cattle-feces application. Nitrogen load was 81. 3-495. 0 kg N ha-1 year-1, while nitrogen uptake was highly dependent on the yield of the first harvesting. Annual variation of forage rice yields was large, ranging from 15. 5 to 26. 8 Mg ha-1 owing to fluctuation in the yield at second and later harvestings. On average, nitrogen was lost by leaching at a rate of 2. 3-3. 4 kg N ha-1 year-1. The nitrogen content in soil at a depth of 0-5 cm increased up to 12. 2 kg N ha-1 over the 4-year period compared with that before the field experiment. However, continuous application of cattle feces could slightly increase the nitrogen content in soil at a depth greater than 35 cm. Our results showed the ability of flooded forage rice to remove nitrogen at up to 320. 1 kg ha-1 year-1 for a field to which cattle feces were applied.

Triticum * Agropyron hybrids will be further investigated and multiplied and crosses of wheat with other genera such as Elymus, and with other species of Agropyron will be studied. With oil crops the objectives comprise breeding sunflowers combining high yield and oil content with resistance to drought, broomrape and shedding, study of the possibilities of using hybrid seed, and testing other plants for oil production. Millet varieties should combine yield, drought resistance, grain quality and freedom from shedding and lodging. Lucerne will be bred for yield of seed and hay and for tolerance to the unfavourable conditions of the region.

The present study examined the effects of planting date (three dates from mid-March to mid-June) on primary and ratoon crop fresh biomass, brix, and estimated sugar yield of three sweet sorghum cultivars ('Dale', 'Topper 76-6', and 'M-81E') grown at three sites from North (29 degrees 24'N) to South Florida (26 degrees 40'N). Across all treatments, primary crop fresh biomass, brix and estimated sugar yields were 70 Mg ha(-1), 148 g kg(-1), and 5.69 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Primary crop yields were greatest for the two earliest planting dates (mid-March to mid-May), and for our southernmost site. The yield potential for ratoon crops was in general only about half as much as the primary crop across all years, sites, and cultivars for the earliest planting date. An exception, however, was ratoon crop yields at the southernmost site, which were in some cases equal to or greater than primary crop yields. Low primary crop brix values were found for all cultivars on the muck soils in South Florida compared to the other two sites, and for M-81E compared to Dale and Topper 76-6. These low brix values were correlated with greater fresh biomass production. Further research is needed on planting dates for optimizing primary and ratoon crop yields along with varietal development with improved ratoon crop yields.","NOV-DEC  2011","2015-06-01 19:08:14","2015-06-01 19:08:14","","1827-1833","","6","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000296727400031","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tests were designed to have one to three test concentrations below the 20% effects concentration (EC20), and five to six test concentrations above the EC20. Definitive tests for each chemical used two soil matrices, three plant species, and replicates at 10 nominal concentrations, including negative control. Soil chemical concentrations were determined before planting and on completion of the phytotoxicity tests. Threshold responses interpreted as the EC20 for each species endpoint were calculated from regression analyses. The geometric mean of the EC20 values (excluding emergence, mortality, and nodule numbers) for each species resulted in values of 30.6 mg/kg for Co and 27.9 mg/kg for Ni.","MAR  2006","2015-06-01 17:30:13","2015-06-01 17:30:13","","865-874","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000235700600029","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wild and cultivated rice (variety Minghui-63) were grown in a common garden in Hunan province, China, and crop-specific genetic markers were used to detect hybridization following hand-pollinations. Using 11 sequential pollination treatments, the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen was investigated. Foreign pollen from the crop resulted in lower pollen germination, fewer pollen tubes per style, and a significant reduction of seed set, demonstrating a disadvantage of foreign pollen even in the absence of pollen competition. When 1 : 1 pollen mixtures were applied, only 2% of the resulting seeds were hybrids, revealing a much stronger disadvantage of foreign pollen when competing with conspecific pollen. Testing the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen suggested that conspecific pollen is often more successful than foreign pollen. Nonetheless, hybridization is possible following the deposition of pollen mixtures, especially when foreign pollen arrives earlier than conspecific pollen. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated rice could slow the rate of crop-to-wild gene flow, but even if pollen competition was ubiquitous it would not prevent gene flow from the crop.","FEB  2002","2015-06-01 17:27:25","2015-06-01 22:24:22","","289-296","","2","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000173715400010","","","","Oryza rufipogon; O. sativa; Pollen competition; Reproductive isolation; Scopus; search.rice; Sequential pollination; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlations between main parameters were analysed at interspecific level. For each species we described the type of pollen presentation and examined its systematic significance. The high P/O values observed reflect low pollen transfer efficiency, typical of xenogamous species. Lowest P/ Os were found in species with brush or explosive tripping mechanism, while highest ones were associated to primary pollen presentation. No trade-off was observed between P/O and the volume of a single pollen grain, nor between pollen number and pollen grain volume. Perennials showed higher P/Os compared to annuals, in accordance with the assumption that annual species are often self-compatible while most perennials are outcrossers. Fruit and seed set, evaluated in eight species under different experimental conditions, showed a close dependence on insects, and the existence of self-compatibility in three species (Colutea arborescens, Coronilla emerus, Hedysarum coronarium). In Colutea arborescens and Coronilla emerus pollen-pistil interaction and pre-zygotic barriers to selfing were investigated through stigma receptivity tests and in-vivo pollen germination trials. Results demonstrated the importance of the stigmatic cuticle in reducing levels of autogamy.

However, the introduction of silver barb only had a significant effect on the number of rice tillers in the ratoon crop and not on the paddy yield. The quantitative differences in the diets of tilapia and common carp were minimal: both species fed mostly on detritus. Ricefields without silver barb produced the highest paddy yield (3120 kg ha(-1)). The total yield of introduced fish increased after increasing the stocking density of silver barb from 319.9 to 494.1 kg ha(-1).

Although the temperature remained below 10C and a long period of rain apparently influenced the growth and survival of adults, nymphs hatched on potted ratoon rice plants and were able to develop into adults. In screen cage studies, the duration of the egg stage was 22 days and peak hatching was observed 47 days after adults were released onto plants. The duration of the 1st- to 5th-instar nymphs were 6-21, 12-21, 9-19, 10-20 and 10-20 days, resp. On ratoon rice, adult emergence occurred after 80-90 days. In Taipei, 73 new adults were counted after an initial release of 100 adults onto ratoon rice in a screen cage. In northern Taiwan, unfavourable winter conditions prevented the population from increasing but were not severe enough to prevent a few insects surviving until the following spring.

Root samples of the two rice varieties Yatanartoe and Taungpyan that are commonly cultivated in double rice-cropping sequences in Myanmar and represent irrigated and rainfed lowland rice varieties, respectively, were obtained for nematode analysis. During the summer-irrigated rice-growing season the root population density of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. graminicola showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in January and at the heading stage of the rice plants in March 2010. With the onset of the monsoon rains, the J2 population densities in the roots of ratoon rice plants gradually decreased in May. During the rainfed monsoon rice-growing season, very low population densities of M. graminicola J2 were detected in the roots of rice plants, while the root population density of H. oryzae juveniles and adults showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in August and at the heading stage of the rice plants in October 2010. With the onset of the dry season, population density of H. oryzae in the roots reached the lowest density at harvest in November. Root galling caused by M. graminicola followed the same trend as the J2 population densities throughout the irrigated season. No root galls were observed during the monsoon season.

WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera (Horvath), Homoptera: Delphacidae) is an important insect pest of rice in Taiwan occasionally. Present study was conducted to investigate its population fluctuations, to determine the factors affecting abundance, and to develop the models for forecasting its population abundance based on the data collected from the monitored fields and traps from 1982 to 2002 in Chiayi region. According to the catches of adult by traps and the population monitoring in paddy fields, the population of WBPH in recent years tended to increase distinctively, especially in the second cropping season. It was observed that the WBPH could overwinter on ratooning rice in Taiwan with a very low population of macropterous adult which could supposedly migrate to the early-planted rice of the first cropping season from late December to the beginning of January. The adults of the first generation from the early- planted rice appeared from late March to early April and most of them migrate to the later planted rice. The population peak in the first cropping season mostly appeared during the nymphal stage of the third generation from late May to early June. However, the population abundance in the third generation was positively correlated with the total catches of air-borne net trap from late April to early May, but not with the overwintered population, indicating the influence of immigrant population affecting its peak population was greater than that of locally overwintered population. On ratooning rice of the first cropping season, very rare nymph could be observable, except macropterous adults. In the second cropping season, the WBPH went through 3 to 4 generations. The populations of the insect in paddy fields were greatly affected by the date and population of immigrants as well as the planting time of rice. The early-planted rice usually received higher population of the immigrants, and the population peak mostly appeared in the fifth generation, while in the common (middle) or later-planted rice, the population peak appeared in the nymphal stage of the sixth or seventh generation, but mostly in the seventh generation in the later planted rice. Population abundance was positively correlated with the total catches by light trap in August, and the temperature in September and October, but it was negatively correlated with the average temperature in August and rainfall in September and October. The population declined sharply in the eighth generation from late October to early November, and macropterous adults could rarely be observed on ratooning rice from December to early January in a few years. Several models for forecasting its population abundance both in the first and second cropping season were developed for further tests of their validity.","December  2004","2015-06-01 18:25:00","2015-06-01 18:25:00","","315-332","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200500110353","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to develop a strategy for evaluation of natural resources, systematic leaf sampling has been conducted and their genetic characteristics measured with 16 SSR loci. In order to determine population structure, a small number of individuals localized together were regarded as sub-populations belonging to a single mother population. Annual individuals were clustered at particular peripheral areas of the pond. Perennial individuals were close by and growing within deeper pond water. Scores of observed heterozygosity (Ho) were not significantly different between annual and perennial sub-populations, but relatively lower in annual ones. Genetic distance among annual and perennial sub-populations in close juxtaposition at peripheral sites showed that annuals were clustered against perennials. In addition, comparison of perennial sub-populations peripheral areas and inside the swamp, found they clustered together and were some distance from annual ones. When the genetic components were compared in detail, private alleles were frequently found in annual plants, suggesting there might be restriction of gene flow between annual and perennial types. Partitions of deep water perennial sub-populations identified private alleles in particular areas, suggesting there were some areas with unique polymorphisms. Combining peripheral perennial sub-populations led to the disappearance of most private alleles which implied there is frequent gene flow among perennial sub-populations. This in-situ conservation site allowed us to observe the succession of populations and also to research detailed population structure of a typical wild population and this found wild rice genetic structure in this single swamp is complex. The data obtained will provide valuable insight about how to evaluate wild populations genetically and how to deal with such populations as field collections.","OCT  2012","2015-06-01 17:26:15","2015-06-01 22:19:45","","311-322","","5","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000323535400004","","","","Annual-perennial differentiation; In-situ conservation; Life history; Oryza rufipogon; Population structure; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fully modern and technologically sophisticated Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens communities re-engineered their ecological niche in keeping with these changes by mapping on to newly productive hunting localities, gathering grounds, and raw-material sources and situating their wintering/home base residential sites in relation to the others. Acorns, nuts, annual seeds, and other foods accessed within such logistic networks were at first gathered wild, but over millennia came to be harvested, tended, and finally domesticated in great quantity. Agriculture, population, and infrastructural additions to natural landscapes expanded in scope. Over a long period, originally familistic lineage heads and elders claimed an ever-increasing authority and personal share of the collective wealth generated by the community. Archeological evidence and written histories, appearing earliest in Central China, document the rise of elite family dynasties that garnered enormous wealth and luxury through their control of agriculture, industry, and trade, while peasant laborers profited far less. Military force applied to outsiders on their borders, and at times to their own people, became an important instrument of this ruling class. Central Riverine China led in all these developments, and over time neighboring peoples in Northeast China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East engineered their own civic and productive infrastructures according to the same dynamics, resulting in a pervasive spread of anthropogenic landscapes throughout East Asia.","December 2013","2015-06-01 19:24:27","2015-06-01 19:24:27","","46-56","","0","4","","Anthropocene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture; Anthropocene; Anthropogenic landscape; East Asia; Human niche construction; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Social complexity; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper summarizes some potential opportunities for better managing existing riparian ecosystems, or for creating hydrologic regimes favoring re-establishment of new riparian communities in the southwestern United States. Generally, management opportunities exist where either the amount of water or duration of streamflow can be increased, or both. Various-sized channel structures, ranging from small gully check dams to large flood-control structures, have been used successfully for both stabilizing erodible channels and lengthening streamflow duration. These channel structures trap sediment in upstream deposits which store water and release it slowly over time, thereby producing perennial flow in previously ephemeral streams. In addition to providing a more favorable hydrologic regime, the deposited sediment also provides a nutrient-rich medium which further favors plant establishment and growth. The amount and duration of streamflow through a riparian zone can also be increased by manipulating upslope vegetation where deep-rooted plants are replaced with shallower-rooted species using less water. Case studies documenting these different watershed practices and the resulting riparian communities are discussed.","June 1, 1990","2015-06-01 19:24:11","2015-06-01 19:24:11","","385-403","","0","33–34","","Forest Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes include the increase of non-rice areas (vegetable fields and woodlots), the introduction of a second cropping season and the abandonment of the traditional synchrony in the cropping regimes over whole regions. Such changes are likely to have an effect on the balance between rice pests (plant and leaf hoppers, e.g. Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera) and their natural enemies (spiders, predatory bugs and parasitoids), and therefore could be of considerable interest in the context of pest management. The model explicitly considers several arthropod species and their population dynamics in several rice fields with different cropping cycles. Thus various spatio-temporal land use regimes can be investigated and compared in their effect on pest abundance. According to the model results, a high proportion of vegetable fields reduces pest abundance. Whether synchronous cropping reduces pest abundance, depends on the interactions between their natural enemies, particular the feeding behaviour of the mirid bug Cyrtorhinus lividipennis. A cropping regime that minimises pest abundance in all circumstances, does not exist. Whether traditional farming practices are superior to modern ones or not, is very much influenced by the type of integration of different control strategies and tactics and the ecology of the species involved.","February 20, 2001","2015-06-01 19:39:02","2015-06-01 19:39:02","","135-159","","2–3","137","","Ecological Modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arthropods; Conservation biological control; Host–parasitoid interactions; Population model; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Synchronisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"S6Z7P5NW","journalArticle","1981","Badulin, A. V.; Lomtev, A. V.","Predators of the wheat blossom mite.","Zashchita Rastenii","","","","","The wheat blossom mite, Steneotarsonemus panshini Vainshtein & Beglyarov, is an important pest of hard wheat wherever it is grown and also infests other wheats of the tetraploid group. It develops in large colonies in the blossoms (sometimes 135 or more in 1 head) and the mites feed on the stamens and pistils, causing sterility and as a result partial or complete emptiness of heads. Some 75-80% or more of plants may be affected, and the yield may not equal the quantity of seed sown. The authors working in the USSR in 1964-79 observed no parasites or diseases of the mite on spring hard wheat or perennial grasses, but there were several predators. These were identified as Amblyseius bicaudus Vainshtein, larvae of Malachius viridis F. and larvae of Arthrocnodax sp., of which the former 2 were by far the most numerous and active. In places where S. panshini was very numerous, such as where hard wheat had been grown for 4-5 years in succession, the population of Amblyseius was 7-21/100 g soil and that of Malachius 7-8/m2. Both predators were voracious feeders, Amblyseius consuming an example of the pest in 40-50 sec, and Malachius devouring 35-50 mites per min. Amblyseius was also observed in galls on the heads of reeds [Phragmites australis] (up to 150-200 in each) formed as a result of infestation by S. badulini Vainshtein, S. phragmitidis (von Schlechtendal), S. gibber Suski and Tarsonemus piliger von Schlechtendal. Amblyseius is 2.5 times the size of S. panshini, and, like it, does not enter diapause, feeding in suitable conditions throughout the year. Its eggs are laid singly in particular sites in the ear. In wheat fields, overwintering occurs in the soil, and numbers depend on host numbers. If S. panshini disappears from the soil, so does Amblyseius. Both Amblyseius and Malachius afford important control and can be reared in the laboratory for this purpose.","1981","2015-06-01 17:50:06","2015-06-01 17:50:06","","35-35","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19820500109","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It occurs on oats, barley and wheat, but Agropyron elongatum and A. glaucum are immune. Wheat-Agropyron hybrids vary greatly in resistance, but the valuable perennial wheat line no. 34085, after exposure to infected insects in the field, yielded only 1.5-4.1% of diseased plants, out of 3552 exposed, while the spring wheat vars., lutescens 062 and caesium 0111, had 25-35% infection under the same conditions.

There would be a great potential to increase rice harvest area via ratoon cropping or stubble cropping and a possibility of increasing yield via fixing heterosis by vegetative propagation. A possible donor of the trait for ratoon or stubble cropping is O. rufipogon. The other species possessing rhizome formation ability for breeding of perennial rice are O. longistaminata, O. officinalis, O. rhizomatis and O. australiensis. In this study, the perennial trait was transferred from wild species O. longistaminata, O. rhizomatis and O. officinalis to cultivated rice ( O. sativa) through distant hybridization. Genotypes of O. sativa and wild species, pollen fertility of male species and environmental factors could contribute to crossability or germination rate of the resulting embryos.

Leafhopper vectors and associated natural enemies were sampled by a D-Vac suction machine from rice crops, nurseries, and fallow fields in Malaysia between December 1983 and May 1984. Leersia hexandra Sw. vegetation in wet, fallow rice fields harbored significantly higher densities of Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky). Nephotettix virescens (Distant) was relatively abundant in second-stage rice nurseries. Nephotettix nigropictus (Stål) and N. malayanus Ishihara et Kawase were only moderately abundant or absent in the habitats sampled. Nephotettix parvus Ishihara et Kawase, a reported vector, was not caught. Spiders, in particular hunting spiders and orbweb weavers, numerically comprised the major natural enemy guilds in all habitats except in direct-seeded rice and single-stage nurseries, where predatory insects were more abundant. Egg parasitoids were the only parasitoid guild in all habitats except in L. hexandra vegetation where low numbers of nymphal-adult parasitoids were recovered as well. Oryza sativa, Fimbristylis miliacea (L.) Vahl and L. hexandra were the most commonly encountered tungro hosts. All habitats with rice potentially perpetuate tungro, particularly ratoon and volunteer rice which carry tungro and vectors to the next season crop and nurseries which are more susceptible to vectors and tungro infection. Fimbristylis miliacea may act as a tungro reservoir when rice is absent but cannot support vectors. Leersia hexandra harbors high densities of vectors but its role as a tungro host is more limited. Elimination of fallows with rice or tungro hosts is recommended as a preventive practice. However, weedy habitats without tungro hosts are beneficial as they harbor a variety of natural enemies of tungro vectors. Such vegetation should be tolerated where possible. Resistant varieties or selective insecticides should be used to prevent tungro infection in the nursery stage without destroying the diverse natural enemy complex.","1990","2015-06-01 20:46:32","2015-06-02 01:37:52","","1-15","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives This study estimated positive skin test response rates in NHANES III and identified predictors of one or more positive test responses. Comparisons with NHANES II were also made. Methods In NHANES III, 10 allergens and 2 controls were tested in all subjects aged 6 to 19 years and a random half-sample of subjects aged 20 to 59 years. A wheal-based definition of a positive test response was used. Results In NHANES III, 54.3% of the population had positive test responses to 1 or more allergens. Prevalences were 27.5% for dust mite, 26.9% for perennial rye, 26.2% for short ragweed, 26.1% for German cockroach, 18.1% for Bermuda grass, 17.0% for cat, 15.2% for Russian thistle, 13.2% for white oak, 12.9% for Alternaria alternata, and 8.6% for peanut. Among those with positive test responses, the median number of positive responses was 3.0. Adjusted odds of a positive test response were higher for the following variables: age of 20 to 29 years, male sex, minority race, western region, old homes, and lower serum cotinine levels.

The best times of sowing were determined, as well as, for some crops (corn, potatoes, sunflowers), the principal methods of sowing and maintenance. Between 1936 and 1941, the methods and optimal quantities for the application of mineral fertilizers, the interrelationship of nutrient substances, the effectiveness of root feeding and various other methods of cultivation were studied in sugar beets. From 1944 to 1958, questions of the grassland system of agriculture were investigated and agrotechnical methods were worked out for the cultivation of perennial grasses for hay and seed. Area and area-cluster sowing and the fertilizer requirements of sugar beets in crop rotation with perennial grasses were studied. Methods for increasing the yield of winter wheat with respect to non-fallow predecessors, the cluster method for the application of fertilizers to corn, and times and methods for sowing groats were studied.

Methane is produced in the anaerobic zones of submerged soils by methanogens and is oxidised into CO2 by methanotrophs in the aerobic zones of wetland soils and in upland soils. Methanogens and methanotrophs are ubiquitous in soils where they remain viable under unfavourable conditions. Methane transfer from the soil to the atmosphere occurs mostly through the aerenchyma of aquatic plants, but also by diffusion and as bubbles escaping from wetland soils. Methane sources are mainly wetlands. However 60 to more than 90 % of CH4 produced in the anaerobic zones of wetlands is reoxidised in their aerobic zones (rhizosphere and oxidised soil-water interface). Methane consumption occurs in most soils and exhibits a broad range of values. Highest consumption rates or potentials are observed in soils where methanogenesis is or has been effective and where CH4 concentration is or has been much higher than in the atmosphere (ricefields, swamps, landfills, etc.). Aerobic soils consume atmospheric CH4 but their activities are very low and the micro-organisms involved are largely unknown. Methane emissions by cultivated or natural wetlands are expressed in mg CH4·m–2·h–1 with a median lower than 10 mg CH4·m–2·h–1. Methanotrophy in wetlands is most often expressed with the same unit. Methane oxidation by aerobic upland soils is rarely higher than 0.1 mg CH4·m–2·h–1. Forest soils are the most active, followed by grasslands and cultivated soils. Factors that favour CH4 emission from cultivated wetlands are mostly submersion and organic matter addition. Intermittent drainage and utilisation of the sulphate forms of N-fertilisers reduce CH4 emission. Methane oxidation potential of upland soils is reduced by cultivation, especially by ammonium N-fertiliser application.","January 2001","2015-06-01 19:39:06","2015-06-01 19:39:06","2001-03-01","25-50","","1","37","","European Journal of Soil Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","consumption; emission; Methane; production; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); review; ScienceDirect; search.rice; soils; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This rice–wheat (R–W) system brings together conflicting and complementary practices. Much of the system operates at low yield because of inadequate nutrients and inappropriate water management. The challenge to research is to understand crop responses to the required combination of practices so that management systems can be devised for high and sustainable combined yield. The repeated transitions from anaerobic to aerobic to anaerobic growing conditions affect soil structure, nutrient relations, the growth of the component crops, and their associated pests and diseases. This review establishes realistic yield targets and discusses strategies and tactics to improve complementarity of the two crops by choice of cultivar, sowing time, mechanization, soil and water management, choice and combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers, management of weeds, pests and diseases, and the inclusion of other crops into the system, especially legumes. While research must attend to existing problems and improve resource-use efficiency of existing practices, the review suggests the need to look for new production strategies that might avoid existing constraints in some areas of the R–W region. In particular, soil, water and nutrient management strategies, such as reduced tillage and use of raised beds, that avoid the deleterious effects of puddling on soil structure and fertility, improve water- and nutrient-use efficiencies, and increase crop productivity, may be appropriate.","February 2001","2015-06-01 19:37:56","2015-06-01 19:37:56","","93-132","","2","69","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nutrients; Productivity; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice–wheat; ScienceDirect; search.rice; search.wheat; South Asia; SPV; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The severity of competition was high in years of low rainfall and on long-duration crops such as castor and pigeonpea. Based on total biomass, sole Leucaena was most productive; even on the basis of land productivity requiring both Leucaena fodder and annual crops, alley cropping had little or no advantage over block planting of both components. Application of hedge prunings as green manure or mulch on top of 60 kg N and 30 kg P2O5ha-1 to annual crops did not show any benefit during the experimental period, characterized by below average rainfall.

Because most annual crops have less extensive, shorter-lived root systems than do perennial species, with a correspondingly lower capacity to manage nutrients and water, annual cropping systems tend to suffer higher levels of soil erosion and generate greater water contamination than do perennial systems. In an effort to reduce soil degradation and water contamination simultaneously something that neither no-till nor organic cropping alone can accomplish - researchers in the United States, Australia and other countries have begun breeding perennial counterparts of annual grain and legume crops. Initial cycles of hybridization, propagation and selection in wheat, wheatgrasses, sorghum, sunflower and Illinois bundleflower have produced perennial progenies with phenotypes intermediate between wild and cultivated species, along with improved grain production. Further breeding cycles will be required to develop agronomically adapted perennial crops with high grain yields.","2010","2015-06-01 20:24:26","2015-06-02 01:39:41","","513-521","","7","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; plant breeding; Scopus; search.grain; search.sorghum; search.wheat; sorghum; SPV; Sunflower; Sustainable agriculture; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (perennial N1 grain); Wheat; WOS","cropping systems; Desmanthus illinoensis; food supply; grain crops; grain yield; Helianthus annuus; hybridization; legumes; nutrients; oilseed crops; root systems; soil erosion; soil water; staple foods; United States; water pollution; wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A perennial dual-purpose cereal could confer additional economic and environmental benefits. We establish that, at the end of a second growth season, selected perennial cereals were able to achieve up to 10-fold greater below-ground biomass than a resown annual wheat. We review and expand the data on available, diverse, perennial, wheat-derived germplasm, confirming that perenniality is achievable but that further improvements are essential through targeted breeding. Although not yet commercially deployable, the grain yields and dry matter production of the best performing lines approach the benchmarks predicted to achieve profitability. On reviewing the genomic composition of the most promising wheat-derived perennials, we conclude that the best near-term prospect of a productive breeding program for a perennial, wheat-derived cereal will utilise a diploid, perennial donor species, and the most promising one thus far is Thinopyrum elongatum. Furthermore, the breeding should be aimed at complete wheat-Th. elongatum amphiploids, a hybrid synthetic crop analogous to triticale. We advocate the generation of many primary amphiploids involving a diversity of Th. elongatum accessions and a diversity of adapted annual wheat cultivars. Primary perennial amphiploids would be inter-crossed and advanced with heavy, early-generation selection for traits such as semi-dwarf plant height, non-shattering heads, large seed size and good self-fertility, followed by later generation selection for robust perenniality, days to flowering, grain yield, forage yield, stability of grain yield across seasons, and disease resistance.","2014","2015-06-01 17:17:34","2015-06-02 01:39:49","","1147-1164","","11","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000345323600007","","","","search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, in this study, we assessed the F6 and F7 generations of 180 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from crossing Nongan/Sathi planted in Seoul, Korea. A laboratory assessment (double pots allelopathy bioassay) and a field assessment (rice ratoon interplanting barnyardgrass seedling) were used to screen the allelopathic potential of the rice cross. Both methods used barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli Beauv. var. frumentaceae) as a plant (weed) indicator to evaluate how rice suppressed plant growth. The results indicated that some prospective lines have HAP, exhibiting high suppression of barnyardgrass height and shoot dry-weight. Further selection for desired agronomical characteristics was performed for F8 RILs in the field in Korea, with some selected F9 lines exhibiting HAP and LAP during repeated planting in Bogor, Indonesia. The allelopathic potential of the Nongan/Sathi rice cross was confirmed on F10 RILs by evaluating agronomic performance.

An improved hybridization technique by which fertile hybrids from crosses between lucernes with 16 and those with 32 chromosomes can be obtained is referred to. The method involves fertilization of non-emasculated flowers with mixed pollen containing self pollen or pollen of related species and forms. It is expected that, in breeding work with red clover, heterotic hybrids may be produced by hybridization involving highly fertile Armenian alpine strains and northern Pecorskii [Pecora] strains. Trials of vetches, Vicia variabilis at Erevan and V. amoena at Stavropolj, are mentioned.

The government has undertaken embankment and sluice-gate projects to protect boro crops from early flash flood water. While the major beneficiaries of these projects will be medium and large farmers who own over 70% of the cultivable land, the landless and small farmers may also benefit from more secured ratoon cultivation. This study, conducted in three haor areas in Sunamganj district, indicates that ratoon cropping is an important source of self-employment for the landless and small farmers and contributes a significant portion of their income. Ratoons are currently grown on only a small proportion of boro land, because of the problem of early flash floods, and lack of interest by medium and large farmers who own the land, for reasons of social prestige. However, the area under ratoon is expected to increase as embankments are completed. Reducing the risk of ratoon cropping through embankments increases the probability that medium and large farms will grow ratoons. The government can protect the interests of the rural poor by enacting rules for a ratoon sharing arrangement.","1990","2015-06-01 18:32:17","2015-06-01 18:32:17","","121-131","","1/2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19931852237","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the susceptibility to BYDV-GAV of P. huashanica was evaluated following inoculation using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). Additionally, an aphid-transmission test was conducted for further verification of virus infection. The results indicated that BYDV-GAV could infect P. huashanica but accumulated to much lower level in inoculated leaves of P. huashanica than in the leaves of resistant wheat line Zhong 5 and the susceptible wheat line 7182. However, no BYDV-GAV particles could be detected in new leaves of inoculated P. huashanica.

Land and climate characteristics of each crop with its requirements were also determined and rated based upon Parametric and simple limitation method proposed by Sys et al. [1]. The obtained indexes indicated that land suitability classes varied from S2 (moderately suitable) to N (Not suitable). The highest land suitability class for crops are: S2 for Rice, Spinach, Beans, Radish, Garlic, Shall cress, Clover, Lettuce, Rape seed, Bean (vulgaris and faba cultivars) and S3 for Wheat, Carrot, Barley, Triticale, and Rice (Ratoon). The most important limiting factors are: climate (low temperature and high rainfall at vegetative and reproductive growth stages), drainage (shallow water table depth), soil (texture) and fertility (low organic carbon content, pH) (alone or in combination) respectively, those influence adversely on the land suitability classes, especially climatic and drainage limitation, because of growing season in autumn and winter Verification of the factors and their relative significance is very important for decision on land suitability.","2013","2015-06-01 20:44:46","2015-06-01 20:44:46","","5395-5403","","10","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Land suitability; Paddy fields; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; Second crops; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In isotonic solutions of NaCl and Na 2SO 4 the perennial wheats gave higher yields with Na 2SO 4. Thus with 0.35% NaCl the yield per pot (three plants) was 11.03 grm. and with 0.5% Na 2SO 4 it was 14.76 grm. ; with 1% NaCl the yield was 3.63 grm. and with 1.5% Na 2SO 4 it was still 10.76 grm. In the early growth phases however the perennial wheat was less tolerant of the sulfates than the chlorides. The straw was found to contain larger quantities of salts than the grain and in fact exuded much of it on to the surface. The plants grown in high salt concentrations bore quite large grains, which had a higher protein content than those grown without salt.","1944","2015-06-01 17:56:08","2015-06-01 17:56:08","","80-87","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19451600948","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many perennial spring crops are also highly frost resistant. The author's early work with hybrids between wild and cultivated species is mentioned with more recent work on the production of perennial wheat and the problem of eliminating the F 1 sterility in wheat x perennial rye crosses. After 189, 000 pollinations, hybrid combinations were chosen which on back-crossing gave a set of 0.01-2.00 per cent. Only a very small proportion of the plants raised from such seed showed normal fertility. In a cross between Leucurum 1364/1 and perennial rye apparently back-crossed to perennial rye two large seeds were obtained of the Triticum durum type. One of these seeds produced a normally fertile plant. The hybrid proved to have 42 chromosomes and was therefore an amphidiploid resulting from the union of two unreduced gametes. No back-crossing to the rye had therefore occurred. This plant produced seed in 1933 and twice (summer and winter) in 1934 and 1935, thus indicating a perennial wheat had been obtained. The numerous progenies were resistant to drought and rust, being only slightly attacked by brown rust and not at all by stem or yellow rust; they also showed high yields, e.g. 70 grains per ear with a 1000 grain weight up to 50 grm. The perennial wheat is a vigourous plant which in the second year frequently gives a higher yield and usually ripens 10-15 days earlier than the autumn sowing of the first year. It can also be used for hay, yielding about 1-2 tons per hectare. The second harvest in the year amounts to 50-80 per cent of the first and the 1000 grain weight is 35 grm. The winter-hardiness of the hybrids has been little studied but the winter form survived the 1935-36 winter. In 1937 a few plants without the defect of fragile ears were selected and the type is to be tested in variety trials. A coefficient of multiplication of 11, 339 has been obtained and, in 1938 it is hoped, 30, 000 grains may be obtained from 100 plants from one grain. Spring forms were also found among the hybrids. Similar investigations axe being conducted with perennial hybrids from perennial x annual rye and wild perennial rye plants are also being collected for breeding plants suitable for use as hay. Work has also been done on perennial vetches ( Vicia cracca and Lathyrus species) and sorghum. Forms of L. latifolius with non-splitting pods have been obtained, while perennial sorghum hybrids should prove valuable in view of their normal fertility, great drought resistance, hardiness under poor soil conditions and high coefficient of multiplication.","1938","2015-06-01 17:39:27","2015-06-02 00:04:25","","213-19","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19391600180","","","","search.rye; search.sorghum; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Out of 60 random primers, which were initially screened against DNA from four individuals, 20 generated highly reproducible RAPD fragments which were then used for further population analysis. With these primers, 95 discernible DNA fragments were produced and 78 (82.1%) were polymorphic, which indicated that high levels of genetic variation existed in these natural populations. In addition, the Chinese populations showed greater polymorphism than those from Brazil at both the population and regional levels. This is noteworthy considering that the Chinese populations are from a relatively restricted area of China. The factors responsible for these findings include the contrasting mating systems in the Brazilian and Chinese populations, and gene flow from annual cultivated rice to perennial natural populations in China. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation between individuals within populations, between populations within regions, and between regions. Results showed that 61.8% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two continents, whereas only 14.9% and 23.3% was attributable to population differences within regions and to individual differences within a population, respectively. The great genetic differentiation between the Chinese and Brazilian populations is in agreement with recent treatment of the American form of O. rufipogon as a separate species, O. glumaepatula.","JUN  1999","2015-06-01 17:27:37","2015-06-01 22:11:27","","638-644","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000081323900007","","","","AGRICOLA; Genetic variation; Oryza glumaepatula; Oryza rufipogon; RAPDs; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); TX (perennial N1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","Brazil; China; genetic polymorphism; genetic variation; Oryza rufipogon; random amplified polymorphic DNA technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis to develop calibration models to predict the feedstock composition and the release and yield of soluble carbohydrates generated by a bench-scale dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis assay. Major feedstocks included in the calibration models are corn stover, sorghum, switchgrass, perennial cool season grasses, rice straw, and miscanthus. Results: We present individual model statistics to demonstrate model performance and validation samples to more accurately measure predictive quality of the models. The PLS-2 model for composition predicts glucan, xylan, lignin, and ash (wt%) with uncertainties similar to primary measurement methods. A PLS-2 model was developed to predict glucose and xylose release following pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. An additional PLS-2 model was developed to predict glucan and xylan yield. PLS-1 models were developed to predict the sum of glucose/glucan and xylose/xylan for release and yield (grams per gram). The release and yield models have higher uncertainties than the primary methods used to develop the models. Conclusion: It is possible to build effective multispecies feedstock models for composition, as well as carbohydrate release and yield. The model for composition is useful for predicting glucan, xylan, lignin, and ash with good uncertainties. The release and yield models have higher uncertainties; however, these models are useful for rapidly screening sample populations to identify unusual samples.","2015","2015-06-01 20:41:33","2015-06-02 01:41:31","","43","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Biofuels; Biomass conversion; Cellulosic biomass; Compositional analysis; Enzymatic hydrolysis; FT-NIR; Herbaceous feedstocks; High-throughput assay; Multivariate analysis; NIR spectroscopy; PLS; Pretreatment; Reactivity; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moench] while maintaining silage yield. In a 1-yr preliminary study, first-cut sorghum was harvested at mid-vegetative, late-vegetative, boot, bloom, and hard-dough stages of maturity. Regrowth was harvested in late August. In a 2-yr experiment, yield, ensiling losses, intake, and in vivo apparent digestibility of vegetative sorghum (initial and ratoon cuts wilted 24 h) were compared with direct cut hard-dough-stage sorghum. Forages were stored in 1.8-Mg-capacity (fresh wt.) experimental sites and, upon opening, were fed to lambs (Ovis aries). Results from the preliminary experiment indicated that dry matter (DM) yield of first-cut sorghum was greatest at the hard-dough stage; however, nutritional value was greatest for the mid-vegetative stage. Maximum yield for the combined harvests was obtained when first harvest was made at boot stage, The 2-yr experiment average DM yields were 7.3 Mg ha(-1) for combined initial (mid-vegetative stage) and ratoon crops, compared with 6.7 Mg ha(-1) for the single hard-dough-stage harvest. Ensiling losses did not differ with harvest regime. Vegetative sorghum was more digestible than sorghum harvested at the hard-dough stage (670 vs, 570 g kg(-1)). These studies suggest that sorghum harvested twice per season (with wilting) will produce a higher quality silage than a single hard-dough stage cutting, without yield reduction.","1995","2015-06-01 20:47:00","2015-06-02 01:41:51","","952-957","","5","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); TX (ratoon* N5 sorghum); WOS","crop yield; digestibility; dry matter accumulation; feed intake; forage crops; harvest date; lambs; maturity stage; nutritive value; ratooning; Sorghum bicolor; sorghum silage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The identification of an appropriate technology with low input, such as ratooning, would allow this niche to be utilized. Field experiments were conducted at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 cropping seasons to evaluate the performance of the main and ratooned crops of lowland NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in a lowland rice-ratooned rice-fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook F.) sequence. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The lowland rice varieties used were NERICA-L 19, NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 22, NERICA-L 24, OFADA, NERICA-L 26, NERICA-L 41, NERICA-L 42, NERICA-L 44 and NERICA-L 47. The grain yield of the main rice crop ranged from 5.0 to 7.3 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 cropping season and from 4.1 to 9.1 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009. The ratooned rice had a grain yield of 1.0-4.7 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 and 1.2-3.4 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009. The total grain yield obtained in 2007-2008 from the main and ratooned rice crops in seven months was 6.7-11.6 t ha(-1), while in 2008-2009 it was 5.3-2.6 t ha(-1). The fresh leaf yield of fluted pumpkin ranged from 14.6 to 16.9 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 and from 18.3 to 19.8 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009, similar to previously reported rainy season unfertilized yields. Thus, a ratooned rice crop appears to be a feasible technology capable of boosting rice production and consequently increasing the overall productivity of the inland valley in a rice-rice-vegetable cropping sequence.","OCT  2012","2015-06-01 18:21:24","2015-06-01 22:02:06","","551-562","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000309098900007","","","","Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven photoperiod-sensitive rice cultivars (BR22, BR23, BRRI dhan34, BRRI dhan37, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan40 and BRRI dhan41), including three fine grain aromatic cultivars (BRRI dhan 34, BRRI dhan37 and BRRI dhan38), were transplanted on 15 and 30 December 2001. After harvest of the boro crop, the ratoons were allowed to grow and in the succeeding aman, a good harvest was obtained from those ratoons. In the boro season, the highest yield was obtained from BRRI dhan41 (7.51 t/ha) followed by BR23 (7.06 t/ha). The yield of aromatic cultivars was ~5 t/ha. The ratoon yields of both aromatic and non-aromatic cultivars in the succeeding aman season were also encouraging and produced ~2 t/ha, which was more than the average yield of local cultivars normally cultivated in the transplanted aman season in that region. The highest yield was obtained by BR23 (2.87 t/ha) followed by BRRI dhan37 (2.63 t/ha). From this experiment, it was revealed that the photoperiod-sensitive rice cultivars could be planted in the early boro season and the ratoons from this crop also produced a good harvest. This might be a low-cost rice cultivation technique in those areas, where crop establishment in the transplanted aman season is somewhat difficult due to the early intrusion of tidal water in the field at the end of boro season.","2004","2015-06-01 18:25:16","2015-06-01 18:25:16","","368-371","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20043039585","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first (main) crop was harvested at mass maturity, after which the tillers were hand mowed to stubbles of about 10 cm tall. These were then left without any further input, until the ratooned plants were ready for harvest. The result showed a large variation in the ratoon performance among NERICA, with ratoon ability ranging from 13% (NERICA 2) to 39% (NERICA 14 and 17). Total grain yield (main plus ratoon) was significantly different (p&lt;0.001) from that of the main harvest. The maximum total grain yield was 6.141 ha-1 for NERICA 2 followed by NERICA 15 and 11 (6.02 and 6.01 t ha-1, respectively). The yield increase of more than 1.5 t ha-1 (the average yield of upland rice in Sub-saharan Africa) recorded in NERICA, with no additional input was very encouraging.

High-stubble and node-cutting experiments were conducted. The length of the middle nodes' axillary buds was longer than that of other nodes during fully heading stage (FHS) in the main crop. The growth rate of all axillary buds was slow from FHS to 20 days after FHS, and accelerated from 20 days after FHS to maturing stage. However, the growth rate of higher nodes' axillary buds was faster than that of lower nodes. Plant height of ratooning rice of the 2nd and 3rd node from the top of Pei'ai 64S/E32 and of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th node from the top of Peiliangyou 500 in vitro were shorter than in vivo. The higher the nodal position the bigger the difference in height. Compared to those in vivo, the panicle length and spikelets per panicle of all ratooning rice nodes in vitro were higher. The lower the node position the bigger the difference, which suggests that the dependence of middle and higher node axillary buds to stubble nutrition was higher than that of lower nodes, and the limitation of nutrient application to lower node axillary buds was higher than that to higher ones in vivo. The difference between ratooning rate of axillary buds from different nodes was bigger in vivo than that in vitro. The correlation between total N content of internodes and ratooning rate of corresponding axillary buds was positive at 0.05 level from FHS to 10 days after FHS, but it was negative or very weak from 20 days after FHS to maturing stage. The higher soluble sugar and starch content in full heading stage did not increase ratooning rate. From 10 days after FHS to maturing stage, negative correlation existed between starch content and ratooning rate, and positive correlation existed between soluble sugar content, soluble sugar and starch in gross and ratooning rate. The results suggests that total N content of internodes is the main deciding factor in determining the ratooning rate of corresponding-node axillary buds in early productive stage.","2005","2015-06-01 18:24:30","2015-06-01 18:24:30","","330-336","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20053068955","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resistance to multiple pathogens, therefore, will clearly be important in disease management. The objective of this research was to evaluate disease resistance in 10 perennial grain accessions (one to two accessions of each: perennial wheat (Thinopyrum sp. x Triticum aestivum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), perennial rye (Secale montanum), hexaploid triticale (Triticum turgidum x S. montanum), octoploid triticale (Triticum aestivum x S. montanum), tetraploid perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum)) to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), take-all (caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), wheat streak mosaic, and barley yellow dwarf, four important diseases of the Great Plains. Several of the grasses were resistant to tan spot, barley yellow dwarf, and wheat streak mosaic. Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T. ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra, a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control. However, none of the 10 grass accessions appeared highly resistant to take-all, and substantial losses in biomass were observed, although such effects may be moderated under field conditions due to the potential for take-all decline in perennial plantings.","2005","2015-06-01 20:43:27","2015-06-02 02:07:44","","1235-1240","","11","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.grain; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grass (c.v. Midnight II) was subjected to soil drying for 5 d and then rewatered for 1 d in growth chambers. Drought stress increased superoxide (O2−) production of leaves and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content of the leaves and roots. Recovery enhanced leaf O2− production and root H2O2 content. Lipid peroxidation of the roots increased 4.5-fold and 2.4-fold under drought stress and recovery, respectively. Drought stress increased the leaf activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1), and the root activities of catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) and MDHAR, while reducing the root activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) and DHAR, respectively. The increased leaf activities of APX, MDHAR, DHAR and the root activities of MDHAR and CAT were observed after rewatering, compared to the control. For the leaves, the expressions of iron SOD (FeSOD), cytosolic copper/zinc SOD (Cu/ZnSOD), chloroplastic Cu/ZnSOD, and DHAR were down-regulated by drought stress but recovered to control level after rewatering, while the expressions of GR and MDHAR were up-regulated and remained that levels after recovery. For the roots, the expressions of cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD, manganese SOD (MnSOD), cytosolic APX, GR, and DHAR were down-regulated under drought stress but recovered except for GR and DHAR, while MDHAR expression was up-regulated. No differences in CAT transcript abundance were noted among the treatments.

Dairy cows were offered GS or 2 intercrop silages prepared from wheat and either Magnus peas (MW, a tall-straw variety) or Setchey peas (SW, a short-straw variety) ad libitum. The respective intercrops were supplemented with 4 kg/d of a dairy concentrate (CP = 240 g/kg dry matter; MW4 and SW4), and the GS were supplemented with 4 (GS4) or 8 (GS8) kg/d of the same concentrate. The second experiment measured the forage DM intake, digestibility, rumen function, and microbial protein synthesis from the forages by offering them alone to 3, nonlactating cows (3 × 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods). Forage dry matter intake was greater in cows fed the intercrop silages than those fed GS. Milk production was greater in cows fed SW4 than those fed GS4 or MW4, but similar to cows fed GS8. Dietary treatment did not affect milk fat, protein, or lactose concentrations. The intercrops had greater N retention, and were more digestible than the GS, and these factors probably contributed to the greater forage DM intakes and greater milk production from the intercrop silages compared with the GS. Rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations were similar across forages, but urinary purine derivative excretion was greater in the cows fed the intercrop silages than the GS, suggesting that rumen microbial protein synthesis was enhanced by feeding the intercrops. In conclusion, similar milk yield and milk composition can be obtained by feeding SW and 4 kg of concentrates as that obtained with GS and 8 kg of concentrates. Feeding intercrop silages instead of GS with the same amount of concentrates increased forage intakes, N retention, and microbial protein synthesis.","October 2004","2015-06-01 19:33:07","2015-06-01 19:33:07","","3398-3406","","10","87","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bi-crop; cereal-legume; pea-wheat; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); rumen function; ScienceDirect; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research was conducted to determine the effect of length of drain period at main-crop harvest on ratoon rice productivity on an Everglades Histosol. Our research was conducted in 250-L (0.95 m height, 0.58 m i.d.) custom-made water control lysimeters filled with a Pahokee muck soil (euic, hyperthermic Lithic Medisaprist). Ratoon reflood timing treatments were 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 d drained beginning at main-crop maturity. Ratoon-crop grain yield exhibited a significant quadratic response to length of drain period with maximum grain yield produced at 28 d drained. Ratoon panicle number was not affected by reflood timing, but quadratic responses to length of drain period were observed for grain number and 1000 grain weight. We propose that the resultant effect of reflood timing on ratoon grain yield was the combined responses to increasing mineral N supply and increasing water stress associated with delayed reflooding. For drained durations < 28 d, the beneficial effects of increased mineral N supply resulting from organic matter oxidation resulted in a net increase in ratoon-crop yield. Conversely, for drained periods > 28 d, the detrimental impact of prolonged water stress dominated the response to reflood timing and ratoon rice yields declined.","1994","2015-06-01 20:46:28","2015-06-02 01:43:32","","478-482","","3","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","crop yield; drained conditions; duration; flooded conditions; Florida; grains; Oryza sativa; plant-water relations; ratooning; rice; water stress; yield components","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RBs grew very slowly or were in dormant state during 5-19 days after full heading when the CCs were relatively low in leaves and leaf sheaths. However, the GG of RB quickened after 19 days of full heading when the CCs increased in leaves and leaf sheaths. The buds in lower nodes were longer than those in higher nodes at the earlier stage (19 days after full heading) when the CC in the stems of lower nodes was higher than that of higher nodes. However, the buds in higher nodes grew faster than those of lower nodes at the late stage (33 days after full heading) when the CCs in buds and stems of higher nodes were higher than those of lower nodes.

The close association of atopy with IgE may not occur in subarctic populations as it does in developed countries in temperate climates. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between total and specific IgE concentrations and clinical atopy in 5- to 8-year-old Alaskan native children. Methods: Medical record reviews, interviews, physical examinations, serum IgE measurements, and radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) were performed. Results: The IgE geometric mean was 122.1 IU/mL. Fifty-eight percent of patients had IgE levels greater than 70 IU/mL, and 17% had levels greater than 1,000 IU/mL; 14% had RAST values greater than 0.35 kU/L. Both IgE levels greater than 70 IU/mL and greater than 1,000 IU/mL were associated with RAST values greater than 0.35 IU/L (P = .004) and early wheezing (P = .005) but not with current wheezing, asthma, eczema, or a history of allergies. A RAST value greater than 3.51 kU/L was associated with eczema (P = .04) but not with allergies or wheezing. Children with current wheezing were more likely to have allergies (P = .03) but not eczema, an IgE level greater than 70 IU/mL, or a positive RAST value. Children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were not more likely than controls to have current wheezing. Conclusions: Elevated serum IgE concentrations, including levels greater than 1,000 IU/mL, are common among Alaskan native children; positive RAST reactions to aeroallergens are not. The IgE levels do not relate to wheezing, eczema, a history of allergies, or past hospitalization for RSV infection but likely reflect infections other than RSV and environmental factors in subarctic indigenous populations.","AUG  2006","2015-06-01 17:30:11","2015-06-01 17:30:11","","209-215","","2","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000239853400014","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since perennial plants allocate resources preferentially to perpetuation and to structural and functional characters that provide drought tolerance, they tend to have lower reproductive output (yield) than their congeneric annuals. Four species of Lesquerella native to arid regions were evaluated to understand the relationships between reproduction, drought tolerance, and their association with the plant's life span. We assessed the following set of characters (defined as plant strategies): phenology, gas exchange, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, total biomass and biomass allocation. Annual (Lesquerella gracilis and Lesquerella angustifolia) and perennial (Lesquerella mendocina and Lesquerella pinetorum) species were compared under water limiting conditions. Within this set of species differences in structural and functional characters were observed. The annual, L gracilis showed a plant strategy characterized by high reproductive output, harvest index (HI) and specific leaf area (SLA). L mendocina (perennial), produced more total biomass, but had a low reproductive output, and also showed characters that provide drought tolerance (high allocation to roots-root mass ratio (RMR), and storage-total non structural carbohydrates (TNC) and low SLA). The annual L angustifolia and the perennial L pinetorum had intermediate plant strategies (i.e. intermediate values of traits typically related with annual or perennial life span). In the case of L. pinetorum we found some traits common to L mendocina: long vegetative period, high biomass, CO(2) assimilation rate (A), and water use efficiency (WUE), and low SLA. The high reproductive output in L. pinetorum was a result of both, higher total biomass and longer growing season compared to the annuals, and of higher HI in relation to the other perennial. These differences in plant strategies among perennial Lesquerella show that there are different combinations of traits that could be used as criteria for the selection of a perennial crop in programs of domestication for Patagonia and others arid lands.","SEP  2011","2015-06-01 17:18:08","2015-06-02 02:07:51","","1386-1392","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000294315500022","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydroquinone was lethal to rice at and above 5 mM. It was phytotoxic to green musk chara at as low as 0.01 mM and lethal at 0.075–0.10 mM. The toxicity symptoms on the weed were dull green appearance followed by loss of biomass, and bleaching and fragmentation of the plant resulting in death in 3–12 days. The treated plants showed an excessive leakage of cellular constituents reflecting loss of cellular membrane integrity. There was a loss of metabolites like starch, sugars, amino acids, phenolics, protein, phosphorus, potassium, and chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid pigments with the advancement of the treatment and concomitant accumulation of oxidative stress as reflected by initial spurt of activity of some of the enzymes of the oxidative stress. Relatively higher toxicity of hydroquinone, a phytotoxin, to green musk chara than to rice appeared to be due to capability of the latter to withstand excessive accumulation of the chemical in the roots and inability of the chemical to reach the shoots. The phytotoxin appears to have killed the weed by causing massive damage to cellular membrane integrity, loss of metabolic activities and macromolecules, accompanied by associated starvation and accumulation of oxidative stress. Such a differential toxicity of a phytotoxin, which is short lived in the environment, to a crop and associated weed may have potential of weed management under certain circumstances.","October 2005","2015-06-01 19:21:25","2015-06-01 19:21:25","2005-11-01","82-96","","2–3","83","","Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aquatic weed; Carotenoids; Catalase; Chara zeylanica; Chlorophyll; Enzymes of oxidative stress; Glutathione reductase; Glutathione S-transferase; Green musk chara; Hydroquinone; Metabolites; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Peroxidases; Phytotoxin; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Solute leakage; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

V.","Removal of vernalization changes in the process of vegetative reproduction of plants","Fiziol Rastenii [transl]","","","","","In perennial rye plants, the vernalization changes arising in the meristem may be removed during the formation of vegetative shoots forming from both the apical growing point of an elongated vegetative stem (Anatolian rye, timothy), and from the lateral meristem in axils of upper leaves of a reproductive stem. The removal of vernalization changes helps the plant to form organs which have the ability to undergo hardening, and by this to acquire a great degree of frost resistance. The removal of vernalization changes does not mean rejuvenation, and the plant developing again during this process remains older in age. The process of removal represents 1 of lengthening the graded development of the perennial plant, but not a return to its original state. The phenomenon of removal of vernalization and similar changes is distributed among all living forms of perennial plants[long dash]grasses, shrubs, and trees; because of this, we can hardly be mistaken if we say that it is one of the cardinal physiological processes which determine the ability of these plants to survive the unfavorable period of winter, and in essence determines the possibility of survival of many of them as perennials. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ","1958","2015-06-01 17:37:07","2015-06-01 17:37:07","","158-165","","(2)","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19593400005585","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To combine on the one hand resistance to Phytophthora and to wart disease with good yield and other desirable tuber qualities and on the other hand frost resistance with high quality are the two main objects in the potato breeding experiments. Barley breeding is directed in the winter types towards increasing winter hardiness and resistance to lodging and in the spring types to the production of reliable forms as regards yield and a good naked barley for brewing purposes. The main aim in regard to wheat is the production of types that are winter hardy, of high baking quality and hardy as regards soil conditions. Intergeneric crosses have so far given no outstanding results. Efforts are being made by inducing self-pollination to obtain varied material for selection with a view to developing a short-strawed rye. Perennial rye strains from a Petkus x Anatolian wild rye cross giving a good yield of grain are being tested in large numbers, and may ultimately prove valuable as fodder. A suggestion is put forward that the bitter lupin should be replaced by the sweet lupin and other Leguminosae as a source of plant proteins for fodder purposes. Breeding work is also being directed towards the production of fodder plants of suitable fat content to reduce the high imports of oil cake, etc., into Germany. The primary object of the extensive vine breeding operations in progress is the production of a variety equal in quality to the best German grapes and completely resistant to Peronospora, and also as resistant as possible to Roter Brenner ( Pseudopeziza tracheiphila] and true mildew. Breeding experiments are also being carried out in hopes of developing high quality stocks and good mildew resistant direct producers. From the cross and self-pollination of apple trees 30, 000 seedlings have been raised. It is hoped to obtain Fusicladium resistant types of apples and pears as well as valuable commercial types. Similar work is being done with cherries, plums, peaches and apricots. Earliness is the chief aim in vegetable breeding and in tomato breeding in particular a combination of earliness with good keeping properties is hoped for from certain crosses that are being tried. A mildew resistant, large berried gooseberry will probably soon be ready for distribution to growers and some new forms from gooseberry x currant and raspberry crosses may follow. The main object as regards forest trees is to evolve races of pines that are resistant to leaf cast and one such race has been under test for several years. From crosses with poplars it is hoped rapidly growing and well developed types may be obtained.","1933","2015-06-01 17:40:05","2015-06-01 17:40:05","","5 pp.-5 pp.","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19341600633","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development and control of scum on the surface of the soil of pot plants was investigated. It was found that the algae could be controlled effectively by reducing the frequency of watering so as to allow the surface soil periodically to dry out. Frequent watering not only encouraged scum, but also depressed growth in young plants. Tomato and lettuce seedlings pricked out in early summer and watered every fourth day for 3 weeks were well ahead of those watered more often. Sowing lettuce. The germination and growth of lettuce seedlings resulting from different methods of sowing varied widely. The depth of sowing may vary from1/16 to 0.25 in. but must be uniform within each box. Of the various methods of watering tried, dipping proved most satisfactory and produced a stronger type of plant. Tomato rogues. Plumpton King is apt to throw rogue plants that cannot be distinguished at the seedling stage by the usual characteristics. The comparison of plant characteristics at the seedling and later stages has led to the development of a technique for recognizing a proportion of the rogues at a very early stage. Orchard cover cropping. Trials with orchard cover crop mixtures emphasize the need for breeding herbage crops especially for this purpose. Timothy grass (S.50) was much more easily cut by the gang mower than Perennial Rye (S.23) even if allowed to get too long. It is probable, however, that Timothy is also too strong growing for the district, which has an annual rainfall of less than 25 inches, especially on light land.","1950","2015-06-01 17:38:17","2015-06-01 17:38:17","","152-3","","","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19500300496","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research was performed in 1994 and 1995, in greenhouse conditions at the U.S.A.M.V. - Bucarest. The experiments were made in four variants and five repetitions. The fertilizer application was made before sowing, with increasing doses of nitrogen (0, 50, 150, 250 kg N/ha) at constant level of potassium (200 kg K/ha). An amount of 0.2 g seed mixture was used for each vegetation pot, correlated with the amount of seeds used for sowing in field. The biological material consisted of Dactylis glomerata, Festuca pratensis and Medicago sativa for the first mixture and Trifolium repens, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perene and Festuca pratensis for the second mixture. The fodder were harvested three times in 1994 and five times in 1995, at equal time intervals. In the plant samples, the following quantities were measured: the soluble nitrate, phosphorus and potassium content, the total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content and the protein content. The yield for each variant was also registered. The two fodder plants mixture reacted differently to used nitrogen fertilizer dose. The accumulation rate of the nitrates in plants was higher in the early growing phases. The nitrates content decreased during the vegetation period as an effect of dilution as well as due to using of the nitrates by plants in metabolic processes. The nitrate content accumulated in the two fodder plants mixtures does not exceed the admitted limits, namely 750 ppm nitrates, for these plants.","1997","2015-06-01 17:19:30","2015-06-01 17:19:30","","81-90","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20063185400","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Institute of Grain Husbandry of Southeastern USSR Wheat Work at this Institute included propagation of the recently selected spring wheats Lutescens 53/12 and Albidum 43, and selection of the following new spring varieties: Lutescens 758, Albidum 21, 24 and 210. Besides these, the spring wheats Saratovskaja [Saratov] 27 and 28 and Lutescens 1433 and 1237 have been obtained by complex hybridization methods. The Station has submitted to State Trials the new spring wheat varieties Flora 5, 6 and 7. Flora 5 appears to be more productive than Lutescens 62 under conditions of the Non-Black Earth Belt. A hardy winter wheat Lutescens 319 has been selected. Buckwheat Tetraploids have been produced of 22 local varieties. Oats Hybrid 113 (- Nemcinovsku [Nemcinov] 2) has been obtained from Moskovskii [Moscow] A-3 15 x Orel [Eagle]. The variety is large grained, resistant to lodging and yields 27 c. per ha. more than the standard. Rye A new variety, Volzanka [Volga], has been bred, yielding 24-5 centners per hectare. Barley Breeding for gluten content is in progress. Agropyron hybrids The study of Cicin's Agropyron wheat hybrids was carried on. Optimal quantities of seed for sowing for each hybrid variety were determined. The most promising of the perennial wheats in the districts around Moscow are the varieties 2, 3 and M-164. They can be harvested two years in succession, some plants surviving the third year. These wheats produce grain of good baking properties containing 21-74% crude protein. Some 2000 families of other perennial hybrids are undergoing selection for their perennial habit. The annual Agropyron-wheat hybrids 599 (= Sehurdinovka), 4871, 186 and 64/65 and the square heads 1 and 2 have been submitted to State Tests. An aniphidiploid was obtained in 1947 of the hitherto sterile wheat-rye-Agropyron combination. Legumes Intraspecific hybridization with pea, vetches, lupin, and clover is being carried out. The clover Mos-1 has been released as a standard for Moscow province. Potato In productivity tests seedling 157-3 and Snezinka [Snow Flake] 33 and 35 did well. Sunflower In varietal trials, Saratovskii [Saratov] 188 was the most productive. Some 27 inter-varietal hybrids obtained from natural cross pollination were tested. Other crops The experimental programme includes work with perennial flax, sweet sorghum and millet. The use of vegetative grafting in overcoming incompatibility in hybridization of distant forms has been studied. Yellow Acacia, pea, Cyphomandra and tomato were the experimental plants. Repeated grafting of pea on Acacia stocks has resulted in no changes in the eighth pea seed generation. Stavropolj Experimental Field for Perennial Crops Work has been concerned with the production of distant rye, wheat and sorghum hybrids. The problems of sterility and brittleness of the ears in hybrids have been overcome. Wheat Amphidiploids of Agropyron-wheat hybrids have been produced which are hardier, more productive and with larger grain than their parental forms. Perennial forms have been obtained. Rye Perennial rye has been obtained by crossing winter rye with wild perennial rye. Pending the results of State Tests the rye is being used for forage. Sorghum Perennial sorghum has been obtained from the cross between sweet Sorghum x wild gumai sorghum. Breeding it as a cereal continues. The present form produces up to 16% sugar and does well on sandy soil of semi-deserts of the Stavropolj Territory, where it grows 2-5 to 3 m. above the ground. Other crops Breeding is in progress of perennial vetchling, vetch and Jerusalem artichoke. Lysenko's theory of phasic development is being applied to several horticultural plants. Subsidiary Base for Distant Hybridizaiion of Wheat of the Timirjazev Agriculiural A cademy The report of the work of this Station is presented by A. P. Zebrak. Wheat Over 100 amphidiploids have been obtained by colchicine. The disease resistant Triticum Timopheevi was used as a component in all crosses, as a result of which the hybrid offspring has certain undesirable characters. These could be eliminated through selection. Crosses between the amphidiploids and T. vulgare soft wheats have given a variety of forms. This method is expected to cancel out T. Timopheevi genomes. Crosses are being made between the hard and soft wheats. As a result 70-chromosome amphidiploids have been obtained. The amphidiploids are being studied. The study includes the crosses between the amphidiploids of winter habit and amphidiploids of the spring habit type. Dokucaev Institute of Agriculture for the Central Black Earth Belt Study of open cross pollination is in progress. It has been found that the method does not yield heterotic forms, but that the hybrids become increasingly productive. Wheat Four new winter wheats have been obtained in the above manner, including Stepnaja [Steppe] 135 which at the Mironovskaja Station has outyielded Ukrainka [Ukrainian]. Four spring wheats have been selected and are undergoing tests. Rye Two promising rye varieties have been selected from naturally cross pollinated ryes.

"UHRJ8VX2","journalArticle","2004","Cox, T. S.; Picone, C.; Jackson, W.","Research priorities in natural systems agriculture.","Journal of Crop Improvement","","1542-7528","10.1300/J411v12n01_10","","Over the course of millennia and most dramatically in recent years, agriculture has eroded natural capital as it has supplied human demands. These tendencies can be offset by infusions of fossil fuels for fertility, pest control and traction, but only partially and not over the long term. This could be called the ""problem of agriculture,"" in contrast to problems in agriculture. Natural ecosystems are unmatched for efficient nutrient recycling, solar energy use, and biodiversity preservation, but they cannot feed dense human populations. An ecological agriculture that is a synthesis of natural and agricultural systems can save soils from erosion and reduce chemical and water use. Reducing chemical pollution of air, water and soils will conserve wildlife habitat, improve water quantity and quality and protect human health. By practicing an agriculture that has conservation as a direct result, farmers can become better stewards of the land. Lower input costs and inherent sustained soil fertility will mean more profit for farmers and communities. Principles of natural systems agriculture (NSA) are applicable to any food- or fibre-production system worldwide. In the central Great Plains of the United States, agriculture should mimic the native prairie, which is a polyculture of herbaceous perennial plants. The Land Institute has spent 25 years studying the structure and function of prairies. Now we and other research organizations are breeding perennial grain crops, including cool- and warm-season grasses, legumes and composites. We are following two parallel strategies: selecting wild perennials for greater seed production and other traits of domestication and hybridizing wild perennials with annual crops to combine desired traits. Although the breeding process will take many years, the effort will be repaid many times over if we achieve our goal: a lasting solution to the 10 000-year-old problem of agriculture.","2004","2015-06-01 17:18:54","2015-06-01 17:18:54","","511-531","","1/2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20053003183","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydrological conditions (duration and intensity of flooding) vary with the toposequence position between the fringe and the centre of the valley. Production methods tend to evolve from the currently predominant unbunded plots without external input use, to input-intensive production in bunded plots. Agronomic management interventions co-evolve and may include varietal choice, herbicide use, and mineral N fertilizer application. The response of rice and the associated weeds to such interventions is likely to vary with the prevailing hydrological regime. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in northern Ivory Coast to determine the impact of water regime (plot position in the valley, presence of bunds) and input use (mineral N fertilizer and herbicide) on the productivity (yield and N use efficiency) of traditional and modern rainfed lowland rice cultivars and the biomass and composition of the associated weeds. Installing field bunds reduced seasonal variations in ponded water depth and resulted in a mean increase in rice grain yield of 30–40% (p &lt; 0.005). This increase was associated with a 25% lower cumulative weed biomass and a several-fold increase in the agronomic use efficiency of applied mineral N in bunded than unbunded plots. Under low input management, traditional varieties tended to out-yield modern varieties in unbunded plots. Improved crop management such as herbicide and fertilizer application, and the construction of field bunds was more effective to increase the yield and N use efficiency in the flooded valley centre than in the drought-prone valley fringes. There is a need for site-specific targeting of modern cultivars, land development and improved production methods in the inland valleys of the West African savanna zone.","November 10, 2009","2015-06-01 19:22:09","2015-06-01 19:22:09","","304-310","","2","114","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","N use efficiency; Oryza sativa; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Weeds; West Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warming shortened the pre-heading phase respectively by 3.3 d, 1.7 d and 2.0 d in the AW, DW and NW plots, while the post-heading phase stayed almost unchanged. During the three years, warming slightly decreased the aboveground biomass by an average of 9.1%, 10.3% and 3.3%, and the grain yield by an average of 0.9%, 6.4% and 6.1% in the AW, DW and NW plots, respectively. Warming tended to decrease rice photosynthesis rate and stimulate the nighttime respiration rate. It also enlarged the flag leaf area and increased its chlorophyll content. No significant difference and interaction in the actual response of rice growth were found between the warming regimes. The above evidences suggest that the expected warming less than 2.0 °C may not cause significant decrease in rice productivity in East China.","September 12, 2011","2015-06-01 19:22:11","2015-06-01 19:22:11","","259-265","","3","123","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomass production; East China; Free air temperature increase; Global warming; Grain yield; Midseason rice; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that Kentucky blue seed germination rate was the highest at 25 degrees C (40-50%), decreased significantly at 30 degrees C (23-30%) and dropped to 0 at 40 degrees C. For the Bermuda cultivars, seed germination rate was two fold higher at 30 degrees C then 25 degrees C, and reached the highest at 40 degrees C. The cool season perennial rye and Bent grass seeds germinated well between 25 and 30 degrees C. Their germination rate was significantly lower at 40 degrees C. After exposure to 38 degrees C for 2 d, the chlorophyll content decreased significantly for Bermuda cultivars, remained stable for Bent grass and perennial rye, and increased to the greatest extent for Kentucky blue. Leaf soluble protein contents increased significantly for Kentucky Blue, but remained stable for most of the other cultivars. Western blot with Hsp70 and dehydrin antibodies identified that the Bermuda cultivars had a dynamic changes in the profile of the heat and dehydration stress-related proteins. No similar changes were detected in Kenblue cultivars. High temperature induced dehydrin homolog proteins, but not the Hsp 70 in Perennial rye and Bent grass cultivars. Findings from this research can be used to differentiate cool season and warm season grass cultivars in terms of germination and survival ability under high temperature.","APR  2007","2015-06-01 17:30:05","2015-06-01 17:30:05","","95-100","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000259850600002","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Management and policy changes in the 1980s and 1990s emphasized non-insecticidal tactics to avert BPH outbreaks. However, insecticides have resurfaced as the primary means for controlling rice insect pests and tropical Asian countries have recently experienced planthopper outbreaks in record numbers. Our review of factors that have contributed to the outbreaks points to insecticides as the most tangible outbreak factor primarily because of their harmful effects on natural enemies. BPH resistance to insecticides and especially imidacloprid has increased the probability of outbreaks as farmers have applied increasing quantities of insecticide in an attempt to combat resistant populations. Similarly, heavy use of nitrogen fertilizer, especially on hybrid rice, has increased the potential for outbreaks. Other factors triggering outbreaks are less documented, but we discuss the possibility that the high outbreak synchrony in geographically separated populations of BPH may suggest a “Moran effect” such as climate that promotes an environment favoring above-average increases in BPH populations. Also, we hypothesize that BPH functions as a metapopulation and, as such, periodic outbreaks could be a natural phenomenon requiring resupply of planthoppers into vacant areas to ensure genetic linkage among subpopulations. We conclude with a series of recommendations for research and policy changes aimed at better understanding the cause of BPH outbreaks and for developing sustainable management practices to prevent future outbreaks.","March 2012","2015-06-01 19:38:22","2015-06-01 19:38:22","","122-140","","1","15","","Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural landscapes; Insect outbreaks; Intra- and inter-population variation; Metapopulation; Moran effect; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Tropical pest management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertions in six genes in 95 cultivated and wild rice genotypes. These six genes are likely to be functional based on nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution ratios which were found to be significantly &lt; 1. Different conservation patterns of these retrotransposons in genes were observed in cultivated and wild rice species. Four out of seven retrotransposon insertions appear to predate the ancestral Oryza AA genome. Two of these insertions in genes 4 and 5 occurred early in the evolutionary history of Oryza. Two retrotransposon insertions in gene 1 arose after the divergence of Asian cultivated rice from its wild ancestor. Furthermore, the retrotransposon insertion in gene 3 appears to have occurred in the ancestral lineage leading to temperate japonicas. Conservation of retrotransposon insertions in genes in specific groups, species, and lineages might be related to their specific function.","April 15, 2008","2015-06-01 19:21:47","2015-06-01 19:21:47","","50-58","","1–2","412","","Gene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evolution; Oryza; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Retrotransposons; Rice genome; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The treatment efficiencies were assessed during different seasons as a completely randomized factorial experiment in split plot design. The research tasks involved: (1) quantifying the seasonal extent of metal accumulation in soil and assessing the seasonal impact on metal speciation for different soil amendments and plant species; (2) determining seasonal accumulation differences between sampling periods in plant parts; and (3) assessing the influence of root–soil interactions on metal dynamics. The amendments decreased the exchangeable fraction and plant uptake of all four metals. The lowest mobile fractions (exchangeable and carbonate bound) were found in soils growing Festuca for Cu, Lolium for Mn and a Lolium/Poa/Festuca combination for Pb and Zn. Metal accumulation and metal dynamics in the rhizosphere soil are compared with those of the bulk soil.

Substantial infestations (&gt;5.6 stem borers/m2) remained in rice culms regardless of cutting height (20 vs. 40 cm). However, the 20-cm cutting height reduced E. loftini infestations by 70–81% whereas D. saccharalis infestations were not affected. Plant dissections showed that compared to D. saccharalis larvae and pupae, relatively more E. loftini immatures are located high in rice plants (&gt;20 cm from the base of the culm). In October, the ratoon crop was more infested with stem borers than the unmanaged main crop stubble during the first year of the study. The opposite was observed during the second year. Differences in unmanaged main crop stubble phenology between the two years likely caused these differences in infestation levels. During the post-growing season, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble decreased over the winter. After favorable winter conditions, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble did not differ, attaining 3.3 E. loftini/m2 and 0.4 D. saccharalis/m2 by March 2008. In March 2009, rice stubble harbored 0.3 E. loftini/m2 and 0.2 D. saccharalis/m2 regardless of whether only a main crop or a main and ratoon crop had been produced. This study showed that a lower rice harvest cutting height can suppress late season E. loftini populations.

The production of cows in early (P&lt;0.001; 17.6 vs. 15.2 l milk/cow day; 516 vs. 455 g protein/cow day for cows fed R and the remainder, respectively), but not late, lactation fed rice was significantly higher reflecting the higher (P&lt;0.007) digestible organic matter intake of kikuyu pasture of these animals (9.4, 7.2, 7.2 and 6.4 kg/cow day, for cows fed R, BG, B or M, respectively).

The results of this study show that the milk response was greatest to rice as opposed to barley or maize, when Holstein–Friesian dairy cows grazed kikuyu. Rice also had the highest in sacco organic matter digestibility in the rumen. It was hypothesised that this increased productivity to feeding rice was due to the availability of more fermentable energy in the rumen which would result in synchronising more N available from kikuyu for the synthesis of microbial protein as compared to cows fed barley. However, there were nutrient differences between the four carbohydrate sources which may, in part, be responsible for the production responses.","May 2004","2015-06-01 19:23:27","2015-06-01 19:23:27","","197-206","","2–3","87","","Livestock Production Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbohydrate supplements; Kikuyu; Microbial protein; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying causes of these variations in responses remain poorly understood. In the present study, it was hypothesized that different plant responses come mainly from the duration of exposure to the gas, growing conditions, and sampling procedures. A two-year field study was conducted in open-top chambers (375 vs. 550 μmol CO2 mol−1 air) using a japonica rice variety (Oryza sativa L. cv. Ariete) as the test crop, with plants grown under elevated [CO2] during their entire life cycle. Leaf, stem and root samples were collected at five different growth stages, and submitted to a series of physiological and biochemical measurements. The carbon:nitrogen ratio and total non-structural carbohydrates were increased by elevated [CO2] in all plant tissues. Data showed that under elevated [CO2], there was a reduction in the total phenolic and total flavonoid contents measured during the seedling, tillering, elongation, and flowering stages in all plant organs, probably resulting from a relaxation of the antioxidative system during seed germination. By contrast, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents increased under elevated [CO2] at maturity, a change in response which coincided with acclimation of photosynthesis. The same trends were observed for sixteen individual phenolic compounds, including the allelopathic tricin, the phytoalexin sakuranetin and several O-glycosylated flavonoids of ecological importance. Overall, the results indicated that during the early stages of plant development, photosynthates were mainly used to synthesize proteins and meet the growth demand of the plant. Growth reduction at maturity made more resources available for the synthesis of phenolic compounds.","March 2014","2015-06-01 19:21:03","2015-06-01 19:21:03","","28-37","","0","99","","Environmental and Experimental Botany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon dioxide; Flavonoids; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Phenolic acids; Photosynthetic acclimation; Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Tricin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of main crop total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) and main crop N topdressing on ratoon crop yield of four contrasting field-grown rice cultivars were evaluated in Texas during 1988 and 1989. Allowing panicles to develop normally or removing the upper two-thirds of each main crop panicle 10 d after initial main crop beading created a range in TNC of the culm and leaves during later stages of main crop development for determining TNC effects on ratooning. Nitrogen applied 10 d after initial main crop heading corrected any possible N deficiency, but did not increase main crop yield, TNC, or ratoon crop yield, indicating no benefits to N applied immediately after main crop beading. During main crop grain filling, culm and leaf TNC levels of plants with normal panicles decreased to low levels (0-90 g kg-1), then gradually increased and ranged from 40 to 170 g kg-1 at harvest. In contrast, TNC in culms and leaves of plants with incomplete panicles gradually increased during main crop grain filling reaching 140 to 310 g kg-1 at main crop harvest. Main crop plants with elevated TNC levels produced ratoon yields up to 5.3 Mg ha-1, averaging 48 and 33% higher than plants with low TNC at main crop harvest in 1988 and 1989, respectively. These data illustrate a moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.66) between ratoon yields and TNC in culm and leaves at main crop harvest for effects due to years, panicle removal, and cultivars.","January 1993","2015-06-01 20:01:39","2015-06-02 01:50:35","","150-153","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","carbohydrates; crop yield; cultivars; double cropping; filling period; heading; nitrogen fertilizers; Oryza sativa; ratooning; stems; Texas; top dressings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on land and water management, rice ecosystem is mainly divided into lowland, upland and deep water or floating rice. Rice ratooning is mainly practiced on lowland rice ecosystem. Ratooning provides higher resource use efficiency per unit time and per unit land area. However, better yield of ratoon crop is possible by adopting appropriate management practices for main crop as well as for ratoon crop. These management practices include land preparation, adequate plant density and spacing, use of appropriate cultivars, water management, application of adequate rate of fertilizers, appropriate height of cutting, and control of diseases, insects and weeds.","2003","2015-06-01 18:25:30","2015-06-01 22:09:57","","881-918","","5-6","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000182438900020","","","","Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of  main crop harvest cutting height on ratoon crop agronomic performance, yield, and yield  components. The ratoons of both a semidwarf and non-semidwarf southern U.S. long-grain rice  cultivars were evaluated in the field for two growing seasons for response to main crop harvest  cutting height. Main crop plants were harvested at a cutting height of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and  0.5 m above the soil surface. The semidwarf cultivar had 7 and 40% higher grain yields than the  taller cultivar in the main and ratoon crops, respectively. Ratoon plant height and days to 50%  heading were numerically different for the two cultivars, but the same in proportion to their main  crop traits. Reduced cutting heights delayed ratoon maturity by up to 4 d, but had minimal  effects on ratoon plant height. No interactions between cutting height, cultivar, and/or year were  found for ratoon yield or yield components. Highest ratoon yields were obtained at cutting  heights of 0.2 to 0.3 m. Increasing cutting heights had little effect on ratoon panicle number per  meter squared, but significantly decreased in number per panicle, which led to decreased ratoon  yields at the highest two cutting heights. The results show that proper main crop harvest cutting  height can increase ratoon yields, but selecting a cultivar with inherent ratooning ability is  also essential to successful rice ratooning.","1993","2015-06-01 20:46:30","2015-06-02 01:51:13","","1139-1142","","6","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); TX (ratoon* N5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","crops; crop yield; cultivars; Florida; Oryza sativa; ratooning; yield components","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic study of the life history and population dynamics of this insect was conducted during the 2002 growing season at the Louisiana State University Rice Research Station, Crowley, Acadia Parish, LA, an area where it is a particularly severe pest. By monitoring weevil populations using collections from overwintering sites, from plots of rice planted throughout the growing season, and from light traps, and by dissecting collected weevils to assess the conditions of their fat bodies, flight muscles and ovaries, we concluded that a portion of the weevil population in Louisiana is univoltine, another portion is bivoltine, and another portion may pass through multiple generations if young rice is continually available. However, only one generation of weevils developed in a single rice field. Adult weevils invaded rice fields in apparently large numbers prior to flooding. Weevils possessing both well-developed ovaries and well-developed flight muscles were found in both light traps and rice plots, suggesting that adults were capable of seeking new habitats by flying if rice plants were not suitable for oviposition. Weevils were able to complete a generation on ratoon-crop rice. The emergence of overwintered weevils started in late March, with peak emergence occurring during April and May. Return to overwintering sites began in early June and continued until October. Weevils appeared to move among overwintering habitats. A comparison of weevil population dynamics in rice plots planted on different dates supported the use of early planting as a management strategy.","OCT  2004","2015-06-01 18:25:02","2015-06-01 22:09:42","","623-642","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000225282900016","","","","Fat bodies; Flight muscles; Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus; Oryza sativa; Ovarian development; Population dynamics; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ir is particularly widespread in the lowlands of the Northwest, where high yield reductions occur each year. Under natural conditions, losses can exceed 90 %. The impact of the disease on the yield is closely related to the time of infection, Four insect vectors have been identified so far, i.e., three beetles of the Chrysomelidae family (the two rice hispa Dicladispa gestroi and Trichispa sericea, and Chaetocnema pulla) and one grasshopper, Oxya sp. Due to its large distribution in the virus endemic area, Dicladispa gestroi is considered the most important vector responsible for the infection of large areas. RYMV is easily sap transmissible, a fact which plays an important role in the epidemiology of the disease in this region. From the three rice seasons grown in the Northwest, the rice of the rainy season suffers most from RYMV. The existence of infected stubble and ratoon of the intermediate season allows the first rice hispa that appear after diapause to become infectious.","MAY  1997","2015-06-01 18:27:46","2015-06-01 18:27:46","","289-295","","3","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1997XK53500011","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the tropics, BPH is usually regarded as a secondary pest which becomes a problem only due to misuse of insecticides. Thus the risk of inadvertently inducing resurgence by the planthopper must be considered when attempting to control other rice pests. In temperate rice systems, the number of immigrants entering the crop and the temperature during the growing season are the main driving variables determining BPH population size. Here decisions can be made both in response to early warnings of planthopper immigration and in response to monitoring of populations during the cropping period. With RTVD (which occurs only in tropical systems), measures to prevent plant-to-plant spread of the disease within a crop are relatively ineffective. Early warning of the risk of tungro infection, however, would allow preventive measures to be taken such as the adjustment of planting times or the targeted deployment of resistant varieties.","June 1996","2015-06-01 19:38:30","2015-06-01 19:38:30","","359-368","","4","15","","Crop Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","expert system; forecast; migration; Nephotettix spp.; Nilaparvata lugens; pest surveillance; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); rice tungro virus disease; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Simulation; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were 2 photoperiodic responses to light: the first (more strongly expressed) was observed in non-vernalized plants, the second (more weakly expressed) in vernalized ones. Vernalization was facultative. The response to light in plants changed with time. Adaptive capacity was lost and development was significantly delayed under the light conditions that preceded the advance of winter, but these light conditions promoted normal plant development during the favourable spring-summer period. The length of the vegetative period was determined by the first response to light in plants sown in spring, but by the second response in plants sown in winter.","1990","2015-06-01 17:32:33","2015-06-01 17:32:33","","195-200","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19910743838","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their inclusion in farming systems is limited by poor seedling vigour, thought to be associated with greater allocation of biomass to perennating organs in roots, and poor adaptation to some soils and climatic conditions in south-western Australia. For this reason, interest in other perennial options such as perennial wheat is increasing. In this research we compared early (29-day) seedling growth and root : shoot ratios for annual and perennial medics (Medicago truncatula and M. sativa), and for annual and perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum x Agropyron cross). For the medics, the annual reached the 6-leaf stage after 29 days and produced more root and shoot biomass than lucerne (4-leaf stage after 29 days), but there was no difference in root : shoot ratio or depth of root growth. For wheat, there were no differences in root growth, shoot growth, or root : shoot ratio between the annual and perennial lines (Zadoks growth stages 23 and 21, respectively, after 29 days). The poor competitive performance of M. sativa seedlings relative to M. truncatula was not due to changed allocation of biomass to shoots, but was related more to seed size (2.7 and 5.0 mg, respectively). This does not seem to occur to the same extent in perennial wheat lines, suggesting that their seedling performance may be more competitive.","2011","2015-06-01 20:42:51","2015-06-02 01:51:31","","367-373","","5","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","lucerne; Perennial crops; Scopus; search.wheat; secondary salinity; seedling vigour; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responses were estimated using an in-growth mesh tube method and a flow model for C accumulation. The BNPP of the well-managed pastures was twice that of either NS or Bh. Turnover losses of the well-managed pastures were 1–2 times greater than NS and Bh. Decomposition constant of roots of Bd was lower than that of either NS or Bd + Ap, which resulted in higher residence time for Bd roots. The amount of BNPP remaining in the soil after 1 year of decomposition was about 2.3 times higher under well-managed pastures compared to that under NS. Higher C accumulation under well managed introduced pastures resulted, to some extent, from the high BNPP of the introduced species, possibly stimulated by fertilizer applied at establishment and regularly for maintenance and coupled with lower litter quality as indicated by high C:N and C:P ratios and decomposition dynamics of the below-ground residues.","May 2006","2015-06-01 19:25:17","2015-06-01 19:25:17","","28-38","","1","87","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Below-ground productivity; Descomposition; Forages; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; South America; SPV; Tropics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include varieties released to commercial production as well as varieties which are being further improved or undergoing state tests. Of the winter wheats bred at Rostov, the new varieties Ferrugineum 734, Lutescens 61 N36 and Lutescens 61 N46 are under trial, and the variety Zernogradka [Grain Town] has been released. Zernogradka was obtained from the local variety M-59 x Zarja [Dawnj. It is ferrugineum wheat, highly productive, hardy, and resistant to lodging, shedding and in some degree to brown rust and loose smut. Its grain is of high milling and baking quality. Zernogradka does particularly well on humid soil, where it outyields regularly the standard variety Hostianum 237. Eight spring wheats selected at Rostov, viz. Sivouska 23 [Grey Awns] 23, Melanopus 180 and 1934, Hordeiforme 273, 364 and 672 and the more recent hybrid variety 2N18 have been submitted to state tests. So far only Hordeiforme 672 has been released. This new spring wheat was obtained by individual selection from the Don Garnovka wheats, after which it has been given the vernacular name Donskaja Garnovka. The variety has an intermediate maturation period and is resistant to drought, brown rust and Phytophaga destructor. The new variety is superior in yielding capacity to the standard Melanopus 69. The work with barleys resulted in Submission to state tests of 14 new varieties, of which the varieties Medicum 440 and 214 are noted for their yields and other economic characters, and Rostovsku Golozernyi 289 [Rostov Naked Seed 289], considered as the most promising of the new varieties. Rostovsku Golozernyi 289 was obtained from Coeleste x Medicum 26. Its grain is large and without lodicules and has a 1000 grain weight of 52 grm. The awns are smooth. The variety is early maturing, resistant to lodging and to some degree resistant to bunt, Helminthosporium and bacterial rot. The yields compare favourably with the yields of the standard Trebi. On the negative side are noted its susceptibility to loose smut and to injury by saw fly. The released varieties of forage plants selected at the Station include the following: the lucerne Kubanskaja Zeltaja RSOS [Yellow Kubanj RSOS], obtained by mass selection of local wild forms, and hardy, productive, and resistant to drought, pests and diseases; the sainfoin variety Dvukosnyi Zakavkavsku RSOS [Double Harvest Transcaucasian RSOS], obtained by group selection from Transcaucasian sainfoin, combining high yielding capacity with resistance to pests and diseases and unfavourable weather conditions; and the Bromus variety Poluk orne vis cnyi 2 RSOS [Half Rhizome 2 RSOS] noted for moderate requirements, high quality hay and beneficient effect on soils, and individually selected from a Tulun sample of Bromis inermis Leyss.

The results have been so-satisfactory that by 1933 77'36 per cent of the plants gave a set of more than 20 grains per ear, some giving as many as 40-50 grains. Further selection was therefore made on these strains for grain size and plants showing the effects of inbreeding were discarded. Combinations are also to be made with other strains of selfed rye from which it is hoped to obtain the long desired high-yielding, short strawed rye. The results show that it is possible to produce a self-fertile rye which is completely immune to the bad effects of inbreeding, and the next step is the production of autogamous strains. Crosses between Petkuser rye and the perennial Secale montanum anatolicum to combine the perennial habit with the qualities of cultivated rye are also being made and from the progeny it has been possible to select strains without the brittle rachis and small grains of the wild rye. The dry summer of 1933 has also selected out the drought resistant plants. It is yet to be seen how constant this perennial tendency will remain, but such a perennial rye should be of great value as a fodder plant.","1934","2015-06-01 17:40:01","2015-06-01 17:40:01","","271-74","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19341600977","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its high self-incompatible nature, genetic improvement of this species has proven difficult thorough conventional breeding methods. Genomics is a tool that will help accelerate the improvements to ryegrass in traits recalcitrant to traditional conventional breeding. These traits include increased biomass, improved digestibility and enhanced drought tolerance. With this as our goal, we carried out a SAGE based transcriptome program in perennial ryegrass from livestock active paddocks and laboratory raised plants (Sathish et al., 2007). The SAGE tags were mapped to our proprietary methyl-filtered (GeneThresher®) perennial ryegrass genome sequence database. Genes and promoters were selected based on the transcriptome data and were functionally tested in transgenic rice, using the services of a commercial research lab - MetaHelix in Bangalore, India. We have identified ryegrass genes that confer increased shoot biomass in rice and ryegrass gene promoters that are constitutively expressed in transgenic rice. Leads from the functional testing are being fed into the perennial ryegrass Cisgenic® program of the Pastoral Genomics Research Consortium in New Zealand, where ryegrass may be improved using only ryegrass genetic elements, using our high-throughput Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation platform (Bajaj et al., 2006). We have also serendipitously identified a gene that improves the seed yield (but not the biomass of the plant) in rice by almost two fold. We will present the salient findings from our research in the presentation.","2010","2015-06-01 20:25:50","2015-06-01 20:25:50","","69-71","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Lolium perenne l.

However, only 84% of rye SSR markers were amplified in S. sylvestre indicating that this species had the furthest relation to the cultivated rye. The PCR products resulting from rye SSR tended to have similar size as the original size, while wheat SSRs tended to have a shorter size than that of the original size. Polymorphism in the allelic number and size was found in 68% of the rye and 40% of the wheat SSR markers. Several alleles were unique for the annual and perennial rye taxa, which were counted for 22 and 15%, respectively. Some SSR markers also produced specific alleles that could be used to identify certain taxa. The genetic relationships within the genus Secale based on SSR markers were discussed.","2013","2015-06-01 17:29:33","2015-06-01 17:29:33","","163-170","","4","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20143065016","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of the new forms have proved to be of great practical value from the point of view of yield, disease resistance, grain quality, early maturity, cold and drought resistance and other agronomic characters and some of the best varieties are briefly described. The amphidiploids have proved to be of insufficiently high quality and hardiness to be used in agriculture, but are being used for crossing with other species and genera.

To optimize the transformation conditions, two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains, LBA4404 and EHA105, carrying plasmid pCAMBIA3301, were used to transform embryogenic calli of perennial ryegrass; two factors affecting transformation efficiency, acetosyringone and mannitol, were then determined. Addition of acetosyringone during the incubation of bacteria and the co-cultivation process increased the transformation rate. Transformation efficiency could be further increased by osmotic treatment with 0.4 mol/l mannitol before infection. Using this optimized transformation system, the rice vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene, OsNHX1, was transferred into perennial ryegrass by Agrobacterium-mediated method. The transformants were confirmed by both PCR and Southern blot analysis. The resultant transgenic ryegrass had better salt-tolerance. After stress treatment for 10 weeks with 350 mmol/l NaCl, transgenic plants survived, while wild-type plants did not. The leaves of transgenic plants accumulated higher concentrations of Na+, K+ and proline than those of the control plants. These results demonstrate the OsNHX1 gene was successfully transferred into perennial ryegrass by Agrobacterium-mediated method, and the salt-tolerance of perennial ryegrass was improved by overexpression of the OsNHX1 gene.","July 2005","2015-06-01 19:21:29","2015-06-01 19:21:29","","65-73","","1","169","","Plant Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Na+/H+ antiporter; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Salt-tolerance; ScienceDirect; search.rice; search.rye; SPV; Transgenic perennial ryegrass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was aimed to screen 68 of rice genotypes that have ratoon traits from 68 genotypes, to determine the selection criteria for ratoon rice and to determine the performance of selected genotypes in tidal land. The experiment was designed in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replicates. Each genotype was planted in four rows of 5 m long with spacing of 20x20 cm with 20 days old seedling. Each hill was planted with one seedling. Plants were harvested 32 days after heading by cutting at a height of 10 cm from the soil surface. One day after harvest, the land was irrigated as high as 3 cm and sown Urea 50 kg ha-1, TSP 30 kg ha-1 and KC1 25 kg ha-1. Of the 68 genotypes tested, the highest nine at ratoon genotypes were tested in tidal acid sulphate soil in a RCBD with three replicates. The results showed that there was a variation of ratooning ability among genotypes tested with regard to yield of ratoon. Culm diameter of main crop had highest significant direct effect to yield of ratoon. Genotypes of IPB97-F-13-1-1, IPB107-F-14-4-1, IPB107-F-14-5-1, IPB Batola 6R, Inpago IPB 8G, IPB 4S, IPB BATOLA 5R, IPB 3S and IPB107-F-18 were able to produce at least 7.5 g/hill of Dry Milled Grain (DMG). The ratoon of these genotypes produced the yield of at least 40% from the main crop, showed good performance and possessed similar harvesting period. Further, the ratoons of IPB97-F-13-1-1, IPB107-F-14-4-1, IPB 4S and IPB 3S produced 1.55, 1.60, 1.53 and 1.53 t ha-1 of DMG in the acid sulfate soil, respectively.

Although none of the individual lines were consistently more tolerant than any other line, 23 individual plants were selected from 13 lines for superior vigour and colour in the presence of Al. The growth of three of these elite plants was examined on a reconstructed acid soil profile protected from prevailing weather conditions allowing control of the moisture status of the soil. The plants selected for Al tolerance in solution culture had significantly higher yields before drought and after recovery from drought than the rye-grass cultivars Ariki, Ellett and Droughtmaster and 4 other hill country lines which were previously selected for high yields in the presence and absence of nitrogen, and for drought and grassgrub resistance. Of the total number of plants tested from all cultivars and lines, <2% had yields that were greater than one third of the yields of the 3 Al tolerant plants. The better performance of the Al tolerant plants is attributed to better root growth in the acid soil. Three polycrosses were made from the 23 Al tolerant plants selected in solution culture. When tested in solution culture, the yields of the half-sib families in the presence of Al averaged approximately twice that of Grasslands Nui in one experiment, but were similar to Grasslands Nui in another. Heritability of total yield and relative yield in the presence of Al, calculated from half-sib measurements on a single replicate basis, averaged 0.33 and 0.24 respectively. Individual plants from the half-sib families from two polycrosses were grown in a nursery and heading date and vigour recorded. There were no significant differences in heading data between the polycross lines and either of the cultivars Grasslands Nui or Yatsyn. Although there were significant differences in spring vigour between lines, they were not significantly different from either Grassiands Nui or Yatsyn. Twelve of the polycross lines showed decreased vigour in summer and autumn. This decline in vigour was attributed to damage from Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis) as a consequence of low levels of lolium endophyte (Acremonoim lolii).","1992","2015-06-01 20:31:36","2015-06-02 01:52:54","","9-19","","1-2","146","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; aluminium tolerance; Breeding; heritability; Lolium perenne L.; Perennial rye-grass; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","acid soils; aluminum; crop yield; heritability; line differences; Lolium perenne; metal tolerance; New Zealand; phytotoxicity; plant breeding; screening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C. partellus generations overlapped, and all developmental stages were present throughout most of the summer (November-March). The borer completed two and a half generations per season. The first generation occurred during October-November, infesting only early grain sorghum tillers from a ratoon crop. C. partellus produced an additional one and a half generations on the commercial crops that emerged later. In March-April, fifth and sixth instars of the third generation entered diapause in the dry stalks. During the second part of August, the larvae started to emerge from diapause and all had pupated or emerged as adults by October-November. Diapausing larvae were present during most of the year. An increase in the proportion of young larvae indicated an increase in the population, and an increase in the proportion of pupae indicated a decline. Infestation by borers started on the funnel leaves and then moved down in the stalks as the season progressed. The majority of winter larvae diapaused in the lower parts of stalks. Pupal parasitism generally peaked at 100% and this corresponded with a decline of the first-generation larvae. The most abundant pupal parasites were Dentichasmias busseolae Heinrich at Brits, and Pediobius furvus (Cahan) at Warmbaths. Larval parasitism lagged behind peak larval populations and peaked at 80% parasitism. The most abundant larval parasite of C. partellus was Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron). Most recorded parasites are indigenous to Africa and their association with the exotic C. partellus is relatively new. Although they reduced densities of C. partellus, parasites did not reduce densities below economic damage levels.","April 1992","2015-06-01 20:03:17","2015-06-02 01:53:23","","518-529","","2","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); TX (ratoon* N5 sorghum); WOS","Chilo partellus; Ichneumonidae; parasites; Pediobius; population density; seasonal variation; South Africa; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined the seasonal occurrence of L. striatellus in an agricultural area in central Kyushu in which cropping systems have been changing since the 1970s. The first generation of L. striatellus emerged in the spring, not only on barley, oats, and Italian ryegrass but also on spring crops of forage maize. The second generation of L. striatellus adults emerged in forage maize fields in July, after harvesting of winter crops of barley, oats, and Italian ryegrass. These results suggest that spring crops of forage maize are important hosts of L. striatellus from spring to early summer. The overwintering generation of L. striatellus was collected from rice ratoon, suggesting this is a favorable host for L. striatellus during winter.

Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999 to evaluate RUE as a function of growth and development in a commercial rice field near El Campo, TX. Half-hourly averages of carbon assimilation were obtained from tower-based conditional sampling (CS), and Qi was measured with quantum sensors. We found a high correlation between half-hourly averages of CO2 exchange rate (CER) and Qi. RUE steadily declined during growth of the primary crop, from 3.18 to 2.65 μg μmol−1 quanta, in 1998 and 1999, respectively, for leaf area index (LAI) between 1 and 2, to 1.57 and 1.55 μg μmol−1 quanta, respectively, for LAIs exceeding 5. Post-anthesis values of RUE were substantially lower than pre-anthesis values at comparable LAIs. Post-anthesis RUE in the ratoon crop was also lower than pre-anthesis RUE. Daily totals of CER and Qi values were also strongly correlated.

The daily Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange (NEE) showed a seasonal variation with a maximum uptake rate of 39 g CO2 m−2 day−1 in late July when the leaf area index of the rice reached its peak. Daily NEE turned positive, indicating emission from the paddy, about 2 weeks before harvest, because of the declining photosynthesis rate of rice in its mature stage and enhanced ecosystem respiration from the drained paddy. Quantum yield of the primary crop showed a declining seasonal trend from 0.11 mol CO2 (mol quantum)−1 in the early growth stage to below 0.05 mol CO2 (mol quantum)−1 after heading. The ratoon crop had little effect on the seasonal CO2 budget of 2002, because its growing period was restricted to 1 month. The paddy field acted as a CO2 sink for about 100 days from late May until the end of August, indicating that the paddy field functioned as a source of CO2 for more than 70% of the year. The ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to ecosystem respiration (Re) was 1.53 for the primary crop period and 0.43 for the ratoon crop period. Drained days accounted for as many as a half of the primary crop period days and the ratoon crop period was restricted in length, thus we obtained small ratios of GPP to Re in the two periods. During the post-heading period, the half-hourly CO2 storage below the flux measurement height was occasionally comparable in magnitude to the eddy CO2 flux over the canopy. When the friction velocity was less than 0.1 m s−1, the storage term accounted for 6% of NEE on average even after influence of temperature on nighttime NEE was removed. Estimating the storage term from a single height measurement underestimated it by 22%.","December 14, 2005","2015-06-01 19:38:58","2015-06-01 19:38:58","","93-109","","1–4","135","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon exchange; Eddy covariance; Paddy field; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following a study of the size, shape and quality attributes of induced tetraploid kiwifruit, three methods for seed evaluation were compared to uncover the effect of chromosome doubling on seed development, quantity and quality in induced tetraploids of Actinidia chinensis. Results over 3 years consistently showed that colchicine-induced tetraploids had a significantly lower seed density in transverse sections of fruit, fewer normally filled seeds, and more unfertilized and aborted seeds than their diploid progenitors. The weight of filled seeds of colchicine-induced tetraploids from the commercial gold-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar ‘Hort16A’ was significantly (33%) higher than that of their diploid progenitor. In contrast, the weight of filled seeds from the fruit of colchicine-induced red-fleshed A. chinensis tetraploids was significantly lower than that of their respective diploid progenitors. Seed size may have been related mainly to the availability of pollen from nearby males of the same ploidy. The dry seed coat colour of colchicine-induced tetraploids was brown in comparison to the black seeds of diploids. This is the first time that the reproductive nature of autotetraploid kiwifruit has been systematically characterized.

The revival ability of the young seedling after periods of desiccation can be influenced by several factors: (1) the stage of seedling development - the later the stage at dehydration, the longer the root length and the lower is the percentage of seedlings that survive; (2) the length of the period of desiccation - the longer the period that the seedlings are under desiccation, the lower is the percentage of seedlings that survive; (3) endosperm size - the smaller the proportion of endosperm that remains in the caryopses, the lower is the percentage of seedlings that revive, determined by (a) the stage of seedling development, and (b) the proportion of the endosperm that is removed by cutting; and (4) caryopsis size - the larger the polymorphic caryopses, the higher is the percentage of young seedlings that revive from periods of desiccation. The physiological and ecological implications of L. racemosus seedling desiccation tolerance are that under extreme desert and unpredictable environmental conditions, the chances of seedling establishment are increased.","JUN  2004","2015-06-01 17:30:31","2015-06-01 17:30:31","","233-239","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000223041600014","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated seedling growth of six crop species in crude oil contaminated soils. The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse. Weathered crude oil was added to an Ipava silt loam soil at the rate of 0 (control), 10, 50 and 100 g of crude oil kg(-1) of soil, which was then placed into pots. Irrigation was used to maintain soil moisture at approximately field capacity. Five seeds of Zea mays, Meticago sativa, Lolium perenne, Triticum aestivum, Glycine max or Vicia villosa were sown per pot. The experimental design was completely randomized with five replications per treatment. Germination and seedling height data were recorded on day 7, 14, 21 and 28. Plants were harvested on day 28, separated into shoots and roots and dried to measure biomass. Analysis of variance was used to determine treatment significance. Significant treatment mean values were separated using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Test. Based upon percent emergence and plant biomass production in contaminated soil, Z. mays and G. max seedlings show the greatest potential to enhance remediation.","AUG  2006","2015-06-01 17:47:00","2015-06-01 17:47:00","","310-317","","4","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000239118000009","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated how non-crop habitats in one AES influence seed-eating ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and post-dispersal weed seed predation, an ecosystem service provided by these beetles. We found that the abundance of beetles was higher in the non-crop habitats than within the crop fields. Species diversity (measured by Simpson's D), however, was greater in crop fields than in non-crop habitats. In addition, beetle assemblages were distinct between the crop and non-crop habitats possibly due to differences in the frequency and intensity of disturbance between crop and non-crop habitats. Seed predation by small predators (mainly ground beetles) was greater in the non-crop habitat than within the potato field. Moreover, we found a positive association between seed predation and beetle diversity both within the crop and in the non-crop habitat which provides evidence of a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet, differences in species assemblages suggest that species identity also affects rates of seed predation.","May 15, 2010","2015-06-01 19:25:07","2015-06-01 19:25:07","","329-336","","3–4","137","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agri-environment scheme (AES); Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Biological weed control; Carabid; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Post-dispersal seed predation; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We grew tetraploid S. bicolor, F-1 hybrid (BC0), and two backcross generations (BC, and BC,) in a randomized block design to examine total biomass, seed yield, and allocation to plant parts within and across generations. Root, rhizome, stem and leaf, and total biomass decreased from the BC, to BC, to S. bicolor generations, whereas panicle mass, seed mass, and reproductive allocation were lowest in the BC0 generation (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Mean seed mass (g.plant(-1)) was 39.1 in the BC0, 107.3 in the BC1, 84.1 in the BC2, and 92.7 for the S. bicolor parent, which translated into yields of 171.9, 471.6, 396.7, and 407.5 g.m(-2), respectively. Reproductive allocation varied from 14.7% in BC0 to 28.9% in BC2 compared with 33.5% in S. bicolor. Mean allocation to rhizomes was 2.71% in BC0 but negligible in BC1 and BC2. There was no relationship between rhizome mass and seed mass within any generation, but there was a positive correlation between total plant mass and rhizome mass in BC0. We divided the BC0 population into four groups with respect to rhizome production and found no significant differences among the groups in plant size or seed yield. Within each generation, reproductive allocation was inversely related to culm mass. The lack of an apparent trade-off between allocation to rhizome versus allocation to seed within any generation supports the possibility of combining within a population high seed yield and production of perennating belowground organs.","APR  1994","2015-06-01 17:19:42","2015-06-02 01:54:28","","468-474","","4","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1994NN38200008","","","","search.grain; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to investigate the determinants of increased FeNO in bakery workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 424 supermarket bakery workers used a questionnaire and serum specific IgE to wheat, rye and α-amylase. FeNO during the work shift were assessed using a hand-held portable sampling device (NIOX MINO). Results: The median FeNO was 15 ppb, in atopics 21 ppb and current smokers 12 ppb. Increased FeNO was strongly associated with IgE to wheat independent of smoking and atopy status. In the multivariate model, IgE to wheat, current smoking, atopy and age were significantly associated with FeNO. Stratified analysis in a subgroup of atopic non-smokers demonstrated the strongest relationship between FeNO and various clinical endpoint such as wheat (OR=9.43) or rye (OR=11.76) sensitisation, work-related allergic rhinitis (OR=8.13) or asthma (OR=5.44), and probable baker's asthma (OR=6.72).

The objective of this study was to quantify brown rust development in sugarcane after the addition of silicon fertilizer to texturally distinct soils over three sugarcane cropping cycles. One experiment was conducted for three years with sugarcane grown in 100 L pots receiving four levels of silicon fertilizer (0, 185, 370, 555 kg ha−1 Si), with three different soil types (Quartzipsamment-RQ; Rhodic Hapludox-LV; Rhodic Acrudox-LVdf), in randomised blocks design with four replications. Silicate fertilisation increased Si concentrations in the soil and sugarcane leaves. The incidence of brown rust was influenced by Si rates and soils type for the plant cane and second ratoon. For the plant cane, Si application reduced the maximum rust incidence, which was estimated by the b1 parameter of the monomolecular model, with values reaching 29%, 41% and 47% for the RQ, LV and LVdf, respectively. For the RQ, the b1 value was reduced by 20%, 20% and 59% of the control treatment values for the 185, 370 and 555 kg ha−1 Si application rates, respectively. There was a significant reduction in brown rust incidence as a function of increasing leaf Si concentrations in all soil types. These results suggest that Si fertilisation could play an important role in the management of brown rust for sugarcane.","November 2013","2015-06-01 19:39:20","2015-06-01 19:39:20","","72-79","","0","53","","Crop Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Disease; Nutrition; Puccinia melanocephala; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Saccharum hybrids; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Silicate; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains varied considerably depending on the year and level of fertilizer and a large number of years and fertilizer levels were required to estimate the ripening ability. Cultivar differences in the ratoon volume varied largely depending on the ripening stages and appeared clearly at the early and late stages every year or at the intermediate stage in certain years. Cultivar differences in the ratoon volume at these ripening stages appeared clearly for every year and every level of fertilizer application, unlike the percentage of ripened grains. In each experiment at the early, late and intermediate ripening stages, correlation coefficients between the ratoon volume and the percentage of ripened grains for different fertilizer levels were generally low or high without clear or with clear cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains and the correlation coefficient for the level at which cultivar differences were most clearly revealed, was higher than +0.7 in each experiment. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between the ratoon volume for fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains could not be revealed and the percentage of ripened grains for fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences were most clearly revealed, were higher than +0.7 in most of the cases. Based on these results, it was considered that the ripening ability could be easily selected based on ratoon volume at the ripening stage even for low fertilizer levels at which cultivar differences in the percentage of ripened grains did not appear clearly. Secondly, using F 3 pedigree lines derived from the crossing of two cultivars, a selection experiment for ripening ability based on the ratoon volume at the early ripening stage was conducted for 2 generations at a low fertilizer level. Inter-line differences in the ratoon volume and percentage of ripened grains were both significantly large and the correlation coefficient between the two characteristics was significantly high in the F 5 selected lines. Based on these results, it was considered that the simplified method of selection for ripening ability based on the ratoon volume was effective in rice breeding.","2004","2015-06-01 18:25:12","2015-06-01 18:25:12","","49-56","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20083078591","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One practice, ratoon-cropping, may increase productivity and reduce per-unit production costs associated with conservation tillage farming systems in tropical and subtropical regions. sorkam, a dynamic plant growth model for grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], was used to evaluate the potential of rainfed ratoon grain sorghum over diverse climatic regions of Texas. Eleven independent data sets collected in the U.S.A. from sites in Georgia and Texas were used to determine the model's accuracy. The model produced realistic estimates of grain yield for planted, ratoon, and combined (planted + ratoon) crops. Simulated grain yields usually were within 25% of the observed yield for the planted, ratoon, and combined crops with cultivars that produced the highest ratoon grain yield at each location. Ratoon grain yield results of multi-year simulations (10-30 years) from 14 locations over the eastern half of Texas using historic, location-specific, meteorological data indicated that the probability of obtaining ratoon grain yield > 3.0 Mg/ha was confined to the upper coastal plain region of Texas. The area best suited for rainfed ratoon grain sorghum appeared to be confined south and east of a line running from west of Corpus Christi to Beeville to College Station to west of Center, Texas. Use of crop models can play an important role in identifying strengths and weaknesses of potential cropping systems when used in combination with historical climatic data and/or computer weather generators.","1988","2015-06-01 20:47:06","2015-06-02 02:08:29","","63-74","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 sorghum; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research described here aims at translating the biophysical processes that affect field drying of grass into parameters sets to be used for decision support systems that would aid effective management of field wilting for silage making. A mechanistic model of field drying of grass was implemented, largely based on Thompson's (1981) multi-layer canopy representation. Given the meteorological conditions at a 10 minutes interval, an iterative algorithm calculates the profile of evaporation within a drying swath. The time course of moisture content is calculated by integration. The model is shown to reproduce in detail changes of swath moisture content, including dew interception at night time. Three input parameters (i.e. swath resistance per unit tissue moisture content, minimum initial resistance and water content at stomatal closure) were adapted in order to simulate different conditioning treatments. Model predictions and measurements on reference plots were compared with experimental drying rates of perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne), either lightly or heavily conditioned. The results make clear that coupling grass handling procedures to parameters of a mechanistic model of the drying process can provide tools for use in optimising such procedures.","April 1996","2015-06-01 19:51:31","2015-06-01 19:51:31","","305-311","","406","","","Acta horticulturae","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","AGRICOLA; search.rye; SPV; TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","mathematical models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) sponsored a joint project from 2004 through 2009 to study the feasibility of developing and conserving water to provide sufficient water to farmers in the Lower Colorado River basin, while allowing transfer of water to the city of San Antonio. A major focus of the project was the development of a web-based rice water conservation analyzer (RiceWCA) to evaluate field- and regional-level costs, water savings, and yield benefit associated with implementing on-farm conservation measures, including precision leveling, multiple inlets, conservation tillage, lateral improvement, tailwater recovery, and a production system based on growing high-yielding water efficient cultivars. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the crop development and water balance components of RiceWCA. RiceWCA uses a phenology model to time water management events, including flushing and flush drainage for the main crop, and permanent flood, flood maintenance, and drainage before harvest for the main and ratoon crops. RiceWCA simulates daily water balance for each rice field within the Lower Colorado River basin, as affected by the degree of implementing different conservation measures. The water balance model includes site-specific estimation of soil saturation deficit, evapotranspiration, percolation, seepage, rainfall, irrigation, and tailwater. The water balance model was calibrated and verified using 2000 and 2002 weekly irrigation records for the Lakeside and Gulf Coast irrigation districts, and validated using 2001, 2003, and 2004 weekly irrigation records. Tailwater recovery offers the largest water saving, followed by adoption of high-yielding cultivars, multiple inlet systems, precision leveling, and conservation tillage. Water saving from lateral improvement varies depending on the extent of existing laterals.","December 2012","2015-06-01 19:38:42","2015-06-01 19:38:42","","66-82","","0","115","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conservation tillage; Lateral improvement; Multiple inlet; Precision leveling; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Tailwater recovery; Water balance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an overview of SHS and then examines in detail whether the prevalent belief in the great environment-friendliness of SHS is really justified. It is brought out that widespread use of SHS is likely to cause, per kilowatt of power generated, no less significantly adverse environmental impacts than large hydropower systems and some other conventional sources of energy. While supporting the ongoing global efforts to maximize the use of SHS, the authors advocate much greater circumspection than is being exercised at present vis-a-vis SHS.

We quantified soil moisture, lysimeter NO3 leaching, soil labile C accrual, and grain yields in the first 2 yr of a perennial grain crop under development [kernza wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey] relative to annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under three management systems. Overall, differences between annual and perennial plants were much greater than differences observed due to management. In the second year, perennial kernza reduced soil moisture at lower depths and reduced total NO3 leaching (by 86% or more) relative to annual wheat, indicating that perennial roots actively used more available soil water and captured more applied fertilizer than annual roots. Carbon mineralization rates beneath kernza during the second year were increased 13% compared with annual wheat. First-year kernza grain yields were 4.5% of annual wheat, but second year yields increased to 33% of wheat with a harvest index of 0.10. Although current yields are modest, the realized ecosystem services associated with this developing crop are promising and are a compelling reason to continue breeding efforts for higher yields and for use as a multipurpose crop (e.g., grain, forage, and biofuel).","2013","2015-06-01 20:24:02","2015-06-02 01:57:17","","735-744","","3","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using US BSNE sandy samplers, the main surface types and the amount of sand transport with changing height under the sandstorm weather condition in South Xinjiang were observed and analysed. The results indicate that the order of amount of sand transport on different types of surface is: bare and abandoned farmland, sand heaps of activated shrub clusters, the active sand dunes on the edge of the desert, the rural roads. The amounts of sand transport are little in the seal sandy farmland, cottons covered the film, lucerne fields, winter wheat, cotton covered stalk and film, the forest land and cotton stalks inside the stubble fields. The amounts of sand transport are more in cottons covered with film paralleling with wind direction than being vertical. The amounts of sand transport in 0-160 cm height obviously relate to types of the surface. The amounts of sand transport ( M, g cm -2) follow the regular changes of exponential function M= aZ b with height ( Z, cm) on the bare ground, abandon farmland, sand heaps of activate clusters, the active sand dunes on the edge of the desert, which have no or few vegetation coverage. Best fit results were obtained by using the multinomial M= a+ bZ+ cZ2+ dZ3 in fields with vegetation coverage, forest land, etc. Wind erosion amount reduced exponentially with the increase of vegetation cover degree and water content of soil top layer. When vegetation degree is more than 20% or water content of soil top layer more than 5% can obviously reduce the amount of sand transport. There are serious wind erosion in bare farmland, abandoned sandy farmland, sand heaps of activated clusters, active sand dune and rural road, which are also main dust sources of the sandstorm in South Xinjiang. Some measures should be adopted to control the soil wind erosion and reduce sandstorm dust and sand source in South Xinjiang, such as expanding the cultivated area of winter wheat, planting perennial grass and green crops, etc, implementing the protective cultivation system, avoiding over-grazing and cultivating rationally on the intermediate zone, sealing and breeding naturally, abandoning and transforming the cultivated land and hardening the rural roads etc. rational cultivation on the intermediate zone, and practicing natural sealing and breeding.","2008","2015-06-01 17:46:50","2015-06-01 17:46:50","","3158-3167","","10","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20083291529","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the links between their impacts on the soil environment and the resulting modification of natural selection pressures on engineer as well as on other organisms have received little attention. We suggest that the strategy evolved by species, or functional groups to control their environment can explain the difference between extended phenotype and accidental engineers. Extended phenotype engineers concentrate their activities on the building of biogenic structures in order to maintain optimal conditions for their growth. Conversely, accidental engineers expend energy in moving through the soil to be as close as possible to their optimal environment. We discuss in this paper why termites and ants are best viewed as extended phenotype engineers, and particularly how their impacts on ecosystem functioning can be considered as results of their requirements and how their activities could induce feedback loops affecting themselves. We also focus on the engineering activities of earthworms and discuss why some species can be considered as extended phenotype while others are more accidental engineers. Finally, we discuss links between the strategies developed by engineers and ecosystem functioning. Although both types of engineer create “hot-spots” in soil, we argue that extended phenotype engineers have a greater effect on the maintenance of ecosystem heterogeneity since they concentrate their activities at a few points, as compared to accidental engineers which may move through the soil and thus contribute to homogenisation of nutrient distribution throughout the whole ecosystem.","June 2006","2015-06-01 19:25:29","2015-06-01 19:25:29","","153-164","","2","32","","Applied Soil Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ants; Earthworms; Ecosystem engineers; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil ecology; SPV; Termites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha-1, and rice straw at 5 t ha-1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss. Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but FYM significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39. 1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with FYM mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with FYM and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semiarid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil.","1992","2015-06-01 20:22:04","2015-06-02 01:58:07","","195-215","","2-3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR ""pigeonpea""); ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.pigeonpea; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon$pea"")); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shanyou 63 was carried out in cement-bottomed plots. The plots were drained 15, 25 and 33 days after full heading, which coincided with mid-summer drought in Chongqing, and re-irrigated 15 days after harvesting the main crop. Daily mean temperature and relative humidity in the plant canopy and at 2/3 of plant height from the ground showed a highly significant negative correlation both in the drainage treatments and in the undrained control, r ranging from -0.765 to -0.831. Soil moisture decreased with the advancement of drainage. Organic matter, soil pH and total N, P and K were all lower in the drainage treatments. Drainage 15 days after heading gave fewer green leaves remaining on the stalk, lower grain weight, seed-setting rate and yield/plant and shorter buds; however, the plants matured earlier, and the bud at the 5th node from the top was longer than in the other treatments. The ratoon crop in this treatment had poorer plant establishment, and lower panicle-forming percentage, bud utilization rate and panicle-to-shoot ratio, giving a yield of 1178 kg/ha as compared with 1438 and 1936 kg/ha for the other two treatments and 2573 kg/ha for the control. The soil moisture in the three treatments during drainage averaged 34.3%.

While N cycling dynamics during the growing season (fall, winter, and spring) are well-studied in California grasslands, details about summer N cycling are scarce, presumably because researchers assume that nothing biologically important happens in soils during the hot, dry summer months when grasses are dead or dormant. However, studying soil N dynamics over the summer is crucial to understanding soil N availability at the beginning of the subsequent growing season. To characterize the differences between summertime and growing season N availability and microbial processing of N, we compared N pool sizes, rates of N mineralization, potential nitrification, potential denitrification, and microbial biomass during the dry non-growing season (late spring and summer) with those of the moist growing season (fall, winter, and early spring) in a California grassland. Many of the patterns we observed differed from our expectations; net mineralization, both nitrification and denitrification potentials, and microbial biomass all increased during summer. Our findings raise questions about the controls on N cycling in Mediterranean-type grassland ecosystems where plant productivity is controlled by rainfall, and suggest a greater level of complexity in the mechanisms behind N cycling dynamics in California grasslands than previously thought.","June 2011","2015-06-01 19:23:59","2015-06-01 19:23:59","","185-192","","2","48","","Applied Soil Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Denitrification; Hydrological connectivity; Mineralization; Nitrogen; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Wet–dry cycles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Khudzik, which indicate that the structure of soil does not exert the determinant influence on crops ascribed to it by V. R. Vil'yams. Soil structure becomes more favorable to plant maturation not only when planted in perennial grasses, but under continuous planting of annuals as well. Even though certain tilled crops do not bring about an improvement in soil structure, corn is a better predecessor than spring wheat. The crop obtained after ploughing was higher in the Southeast, even though the structure of soil is better after scuffling than after ploughing. Spring wheat following on sod often gives a lesser crop than after some other predecessors, even though soil structure improves after grasses. Clean fallow comprises a good predecessor for all crops, even though soil structure does not improve through fallowing. The significance of soil structure is lessened in drought regions or nullified by factors of its formation. The perennial grasses and Sudan grass exert a favorable effect on soil structure, but dessicate the soil deeply and extensively. Furthermore, cereal grasses deteriorate the N content of soil. Perennial grasses will prove preferrable to annual legumes on steep slopes (danger of erosion), on compound soils where structural alkali soils predominate, on irrigated soils where harvests of 100 metric cntr/ha of lucerne hay are possible. The effective productivity of soil is not governed solely by structure, but also by numerous other factors, a majority of which are controlled by man. The experience of numerous farms which abandoned the grassland system, yet achieved still greater cropping and production yields, confirms further the lack of agronomic justification for that system of farming. It would be improper to designate the new farming system as ""fallow-ploughing"" thus emphasizing the nonexistent major significance of fallowing, or as ""seeding-ploughing"" inasmuch as row width furrow ploughing will continually diminish with expanded application of herbicides and methods of crop care do not govern either the direction or the arrangement of a farming system. The designation ""arid farming system"" will reflect better the regional characteristics and the trend of the agrotechnical measures (with reference to the Povolzh'e region).","1961","2015-06-01 17:52:34","2015-06-01 17:52:34","","60-63","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19634200011910","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of modified land covers on soil water dynamics. In each individual year, modified land covers including winter rye-corn (rC), winter rye-soybean (rS), kura clover as a living mulch for corn (kC), and perennial forage (PF), as well as conventional corn (C) and soybean (S), were grown in subsurface drained plots in north-central Iowa. Results showed that subsurface drainage was not reduced under modified land covers in comparison to conventional corn and soybean. Soil water storage (SWS) was significantly reduced by PF treatments during the whole growing seasons and by kC during May through July when compared to the cropping system with corn or soybean only (p&lt;0.05). Treatments of rC and rS typically maintained higher SWS than C and S, respectively, during the 3 years of this study. In the spring during a 10-15-day period when the rainfall was minimal, SWS in plots with rye, kura clover, and forage decreased at a significantly higher rate than the C and S plots which were bare. Estimated evapotranspiration (ET) during this period was significantly higher in rS, kC, and PF treatments than C and S. The results of this study suggested that significantly higher ET and similar drainage for modified land covers may increase water infiltration, which would be expected to reduce surface runoff thus to decrease stream flow.

Overall, the ratooning ability of japonica was better than that of indica, however the percentages of somaclones with high ratooning ability and improvement in average ratooning ability compared to the parent were higher in the indica variety. Ratoons from somaclones were shorter than those of their parents, with the reduction being greater in Pokkali than in Fuzisaka-3. Panicle length of somaclones was slightly increased over that of the parents in both varieties. Ratoon spikelet sterility was higher in somaclones than in parents, although the magnitude was low in Pokkali. A number of somaclones produced no yield due to complete spikelet sterility.

N fertilization tended to decrease the per cent Ladino clover and the protein and Ca content in the clover -grass forage and increased the protein content of the grass herbage. The Ca content of the grass herbage was decreased by N fertilization. The P and Mg contents of the clover-grass and grass herbage were not appreciably altered by N fertilization. Decreasing the time interval between N applications resulted in a more even production of dry matter over the growing season but did not increase the total seasonal yield.

Treated and control lots of seeds of meadow fescue, perennial rye grass, Kentucky Blue grass, oats, spring rye, and wheat produced plants with the same growth rate and time of maturity. A study of the flowering of larkspur, marigold, nasturtium, snapdragon, stock, and zinnia plants from treated seeds revealed no significant differences from the control plants, either in the number of plants producing flowers or in the number of flowers produced.

Frequency of isolation was significantly greater from plots which had been limed and from those receiving nitrogen; there was, however, no evidence of an interaction between lime and nitrogen. There was also a significant seasonal variation in frequency of isolation. This could not be related simply to either soil moisture or temperature considered independently, but there was evidence of interaction in that low frequencies were associated with either (a) low temperature (&lt; 7° C.) and high moisture or (b) high temperature (&gt; 7°) and low moisture; higher frequencies, on the other hand, were associated with high temperature coupled with high moisture. Frequency of recovery of the fungus from soil samples incubated in the laboratory for 28 days, under a wide range of temperature and moisture conditions, followed closely that found in the field. The inhibitory effect of high temperature at low moisture levels was not observed in sterilized soil, and it has been concluded that under these conditions microbial antagonism plays a significant role in determining the activity of F. culmorum. It has been found that, in sterilized soil at low moisture levels, Trichoderma viride suppresses growth of F. culmorum at temperatures above 10°, whereas at lower temperatures F. culmorum suppresses T. viride.","September 1961","2015-06-01 19:33:49","2015-06-01 19:33:49","","343-353","","3","44","","Transactions of the British Mycological Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; search.rye; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water quality in canals carrying drinking water deteriorates due to pollution by fouling organisms. In a river, representing another type of flow, there are three factors relating to self-purification of water: sands through which the water filters; shallow stretches of water with aquatic vegetation, in which a segment of biogenic substance is surrendered, quantity of plankton decreases and a coagulation of some substances does occur; also, deep water sedimentation stretches in which suspended matter settles. These natural resources should be subject to intelligent exploitation. The significance of sand in self-purification of water was demonstrated on laboratory models. Discussed are trends in practical exploitation of higher forms of aquatic vegetation, in part with relation to water supply, where cultivation and harvest of plants for farm animal fodder is one of the economically sound means, while exploitation of the antagonism of higher aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton represents a radical means of controlling florescence. It would be proper to limit research at the start to four plants, most promising from the standpoint of fodder, annual and perennial rice, canary grass and sloughgrass; the work should involve crop assimilation and development of farming techniques on a scale of one to two farms.

A.; Carberry, P.","Sorghum in the farming system: reviewing performance, and identifying opportunities by doing on-farm research.","AIAS Occasional Publication","","0728-859X","","","Until recently the investigation of crop management on-farm has been a minor part of the broad scientific research effort. Researchers have been content rather to apply skills derived from crop science to solve specific plant problems of adaptation and protection, nutrition, water use and so forth. Any particular farmer best appreciates the specifics of managing his or her own crop and paddock combination, such that interaction with researchers may diminish once the general principles of crop and plant performance are understood. In dryland farming, however, there is a great deal of `slack' in the linkage between principles and practice. This situation has been addressed with the development of soil and crop monitoring tools that provide the specifics of a crop and paddock which can be linked to the principles of system performance using a simulation model. The output generated by a crop simulator enables researchers to contribute usefully to discussions of crop management with farmers. Actual and simulated experience are compared and combined, leading to enhanced appreciation by the farmer of the degree of exposure to risk that he faces in making management decisions. This would be expected to enhance the farmer's ability to make decisions that improve productivity and profit. Sorghum occupies a major niche in many semiarid subtropical farming systems due to its generally low cost of production, and its ability to respond to favourable seasons with high yield. The sorghum crop is flexible, providing vital soil protection both as a standing crop and as postharvest residue, and it is also valuable forage. Even in a situation where the price of cotton can give a gross return 3 times higher than sorghum on a crop-for-crop basis, sorghum holds a strong position because of the lower risk involved in both establishing and protecting the crop. Sorghum has a growing season that is one third shorter than cotton and it consumes proportionally less soil water resources, and also provides substantial protective residue whereas the recommendation for cotton fields is postharvest cultivation to reduce the survival of resistant pests. Sorghum presents the possibility of a ratoon crop which provides prolonged soil protection and takes advantage of spring rainfall, especially in the northern grain belt, where the `gain to rain' ratio is likely to be higher for the ratoon crop than the primary crop. On-farm cropping research enables a systematic assessment of the different levels of risk associated with substitutable crops. The equivalent of many years of farming experience can be accumulated, using advanced tools for monitoring and simulation. This approach contributes to valuable learning when researchers and farmers interpret simulator outputs in a discussion group that pays heed also to their personal experience.","1996","2015-06-01 19:08:58","2015-06-01 19:08:58","","63-77","","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19970700849","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of this it is now possible for every locality to cultivate only those varieties that are adapted to it-the State Variety Testing Service is testing over 2, 000 Soviet and foreign varieties of 125 different crops at 400 different stations. Breeding methods are being fundamentally changed so as to form a complex system involving the co-operation of physiologists, phytopathologists, entomologists, chemists and technologists. The more important achievements in the form of improved new varieties are reviewed. Special mention is made of the use of wild fruit trees in hybridization by Michurin, of the hybrids of wheat by rye of Meister and others, the production by interspecific crossing of wheats of the vulgare type having the hard durum grain, of perennial wheats from crosses with Agropyrum, of fertile amphidiploids between a number of species giving sterile hybrids and of sugar beet x mangold hybrids with increased yield. Special reference is also made to the discovery of new species of wheat and potatoes and the valuable practical results that are already beginning to accrue therefrom; also to the valuable results obtained from artificial curtailment of the length of day in many southern forms of both herbaceous plants and trees. Special new methods, suitable for use by breeders, have been elaborated for determining the cold and drought resistance and other physiological properties of the plant, extensive tests have been carried out with success on vernalization, special attention has been devoted to quality in nearly all crops, and the areas of possible cultivation of a great number of crops, notably cotton, have been extended by the production of improved forms. Collections have been made of the cultivated plants of the whole world, the wild fruit trees having proved to be specially interesting and important, the centre of origin of most European fruit trees having been shewn to be in Transcaucasia and Central Asia, including parts of Persia and Turkey. A thorough study of these areas is being executed. Great numbers of new plants have also been brought into cultivation, including the valuable new rubber plant tau-saghiz, which yields a rubber of the first quality. The application of cytogenetics has led to the production of polyploid forms of certain small bush fruits with increased berry size. Similarly Pangalo's studies on the cucurbits have made known the extent and the interrelationships of this large group for the first time, by classifying the whole world collection and separating out the most valuable types, and by crossing with species themselves not distinguished by high sugar content twofold increases in the sugar content have resulted.","1934","2015-06-01 17:21:14","2015-06-01 23:59:50","","5-23","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600066","","","","search.grain; search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From crops thus grown the following average yields were obtained over a 4-yr. period on fertilized and unfertilized backgrounds respectively: winter rye, on fertilized background, 25 to 27 metric centners/ha, without fertilization, 16 to 20 metric centners/ha; spring wheat 12 metric centners/ha, and 8 metric centners/ha respectively; potato 196 to 232 metric centners/ha, and 147.5 metric centners/ha respectively. When sown on a 2-year grass sod grown on well cultivated soils, the yields were: winter rye 26 and 17 metric centners/ha with and without fertilized background respectively; spring wheat 27 and 20 metric centners/ha respectively. In these conditions it is profitable to grow spring wheat and other spring crops, or potato. In the 1st year after the plowing in of grass sod the number of water-stable aggregates in the soil increased considerably. The structure of soil is retained for 3 years after the plowing in of grass sod, but then sharply deteriorates especially in nonfertilized soil. When grass is plowed for winter crops in summer, there is a decrease of water-stable aggregates. If the plowed sod is used for potato, these changes are unimportant. The total yield of a 4-yr. link of crop rotation with clover fallow is more productive than the same link with bare fallow. Winter rye yield after occupied fallow and fertilized soil was similar to that after fertilized bare fallow. Corn yield was highest on plowed sod after cereals, while corn sown after potato gave only a low yield. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Courtesy NSF (PL 83-480) 1963","1957","2015-06-01 17:37:17","2015-06-01 17:37:17","","31-60","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19674800066820","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on observed daily meteorological data in 50 weather stations in 7 sub-zones of Huang-Huai-Hai Farming Region (HFR) in 1960-2009, winter wheat water requirement and irrigation amount were simulated using the modified SIMETAW model. Results showed that winter wheat water requirement decreased from 1960 to 2009, with a significant decrease of 9.21-18.90 mm from 1970 to 1999. Winter wheat perennial average water requirement was 452.4 mm, coupled rainfall degree for winter wheat growing season was only 0.40. Winter wheat irrigation amount varied among different sub-zones, it increased at the rate of 10.02-13.48 mm per decade in western Henan Province and central Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces. With regard to spatial distribution, water requirement and irrigation amount during winter wheat growing season were higher in the peripheral than in the central regions. Both water requirement and irrigation amount were highest in the west Henan Province with values of 457.32 mm and 335.33 mm. However, winter wheat water requirement and irrigation amount were lowest in the lower Haihe Plain with values of 363.24 and 247.51 mm. While temperature significantly increased, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation significantly decreased and also with an insignificant decrease in precipitation from 1960 to 2009. The negative trend in winter wheat water requirement in HFR was mainly attributed to declining solar radiation, which was in turn driven by some other climatic factors. Correlation analysis showed that temperature, sunshine hour and wind speed were positively correlated with winter wheat water requirement, while relative humidity was negatively correlated with it.","2012","2015-06-01 17:46:02","2015-06-01 17:46:02","","356-362","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20123188586","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Sweden, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is often used as a catch crop, both in experiments and by farmers. Autumn-sown crops such as winter wheat and winter rye are not as efficient as ryegrass in reducing soil nitrogen content during autumn and winter. Thus, to meet the Swedish legislation of keeping arable land covered with catch crops during autumn and winter, it may be necessary to establish a catch crop in a growing winter cereal crop. In this study, with the objective of evaluate methods for catch crop establishment in winter cereals, different dates for under-sowing winter wheat with perennial ryegrass in spring were compared. Two held experiments per year were carried out during a four-year period. In 1994, double- and single-mounted tractor wheels were added as treatments and in 1995-97, two types of seed drills were compared. Under-sowing with ryegrass in spring had only minor effects on winter wheat yields. Only very early in weak wheat stands or very late in wheat already at stem elongation did the action of the seed drill significantly reduce yield. It was observed that the choice of drill for under-sowing might influence the wheat yield. In a dense winter wheat crop, fast emergence was important for establishment of a good catch crop. In most cases, the highest number of emerged ryegrass plants was achieved by early under-sowing, since soil water content was generally higher in early spring than in late. On sowing too early, however, soil temperature was too low for acceptable establishment. Ryegrass establishment and growth were lowest at the latest sowing dates.","1998","2015-06-01 17:48:00","2015-06-01 17:48:00","","83-90","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000076296800002","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For wetland rice, additional studies were conducted to determine the feasibility of ratoon cropping in increasing the productivity of rice. Furthermore, the different seedling ages were used in the experiment with wetland rice to determine the feasibility of reducing field duration. The dibbling method produced higher grain yield than the other methods for dryland seeding, and the drilling method for wetland seeding. The normal tillage operation gave grain yield similar to that obtained with intensive land preparation. During both dry and wet seasons two split applications of nitrogen fertilizer produced the same grain yield as the placement of nitrogen in the reduced soil layer. For the dry season, the optimum seedling age for the early-maturing varieties was 20 to 30 days, and for the medium- and late-maturing varieties was 30 to 40 days. But for the wet season planting, the optimum seedling ages for all varieties were 20 to 30 days. Seedling ages of the main crop had no effect on the grain yield of the rice ratoon crop. Deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer to the main crop gave a higher grain yield in the ratoon crop compared with split application. Higher grain yields were obtained from the rice ratoons from the late-maturing varieties. The grain yield of the rice ratoon crops ranged from 28 to 34% of the main crop. The maturity of the ratoon crops varied from 53 to 68 days after cutting the main crops depending upon the variety.","1980","2015-06-01 18:40:43","2015-06-01 18:40:43","","112-116","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093019589","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major objective is to increase small ruminant productivity by better utilizing locally available feedstuffs and to more closely meet the nutritional needs of animals during the critical phases of their production cycle. West Java, Indonesia, is a humid tropical site with high rainfall and intensive agriculture, with small ruminants raised in nearly total confinement. Village feed resources include native grasses, tree legumes, and foliage from food crops. Energy may be the most limiting nutrient, due to seasonal feed availability and intake limitation when tropical grasses form a large proportion of the diet. Western Kenya is a wet-dry tropical site with a long and a short rainy season. The feasibility of intensifying dual purpose goat production within mixed crop-livestock systems is under study. Solutions to severe dry season feed limitations are being evaluated. Sweet potato vines and legumes such as pigeon peas have been demonstrated to be excellent in nutritional value, with high intakes by lactating does. Intercropped or ratooned sorghum also has promise. Northeast Brazil is representative of the semiarid tropics with a short, variable rainy season and prolonged dry season during which all production parameters for goats and hair sheep are unsatisfactory. The native “caatinga” brushland is the major feed resource. Dry season confinement of lambs has resulted in adequate growth (90 g/day or more) when fed maized crop residue plus supplements. Weanling kids fed the same ration have lower intake and gains of 20 to 40 g/day. Sorghum hay has been fed to lactating dairy goats. The fourth site, Morocco, has a Mediterranean climate with good rainfall in spring, prolonged drought in summer and fall, and cold limitation in winter (especially at higher elevations). Wheat stubble and other crop residues are under study for their nutritional contribution and supplementation requirements in summer, fall and winter. Also, studies are underway on productivity responses of native sheep in extensive or semi-intensive systems, as well as the prolific D'man breed in total confinement. The fifth site is Peru, where Andean highland areas are limited by cold year-round and extended drought for part of the year. Grazing systems for sheep and alpacas are under study at three Andean locations. At a coastal site, which receives sporadic rain (1 to 3 months, not every year), improved feeding systems for seminomadic herds of dual purpose goats are under study.","March 1984","2015-06-01 19:40:19","2015-06-01 23:59:29","","589-601","","1–4","2","","Preventive Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","crop residues; Goats; humid tropics; Nutrition; ratoon* W/5 sorghum; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.sorghum; semiarid tropics; sheep; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Almost all acetylenes generally showed growth inhibitory activity. The diacetylenes exhibited higher activity than the monoacetylenes, suggesting that a conjugated diyne segment is essential for the activity. On the other hand, the acetylenes with a nonoxidated methylene group at C-8 showed stronger activity comparing with those possessing hydroxy and acetoxy groups at C-8. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the acetylenes bearing a terminal olefinic group at C-16,C-17 enhanced the activity. It is thus clarified that important sites for the activity of the acetylenes from galls of H. rhombea are a conjugated diyne and a terminal olefinic group connecting to the aliphatic chain and that less oxidated compounds show more activity.","JUL-AUG  2006","2015-06-01 17:27:03","2015-06-01 22:21:54","","536-540","","7-8","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000240219700011","","","","Acetylenes; Hedera rhombea; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; Structure-Activity Relationship; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The eggs deposited in the period between the end of Nov. 1983 and the end of Feb. 1984 are incubated under the outdoor conditions. The eggs are capable of hatching during the winter, no diapause are observed. However the incubation period is increased with the progression of winter season, the egg stage prolongs to 60 days in maximum and 50.12 .+-. 4.18 days in average. The low temperature bring mal-influence on the survival and development of eggs. The symptom can be divided into two large groups. One is characterized with eggs which do not show any embryonic development. The other group of eggs show the symptom of deformation during their embryonic development and fail to hatch at the last. The dead eggs in the first group are considered to be caused by mal-influence of low temperature through their mother adult. The latter are presumed to be influenced directly by the cold conditions at the egg stage. In the fallowing paddy field, the egg population on the ratoon paddy increase from December. The population peak is observed in the middle of January. Most of those eggs hatch in the middle of February. Then, the temperature condition is no longer serious to the newly hatched nymphs. Therefore the survival rate of the nymph are surely high. They are recognized to be the first generation of planthopper of the year. The low temperature seems a mechanism regulating the embryonic development of brown planthopper during winter season. As a result, the hatching of overwintering eggs are concentrated in the middle of February. Based on the finding, the monitoring operation on the abundance of the first generation is suggested to focus on the egg density in ratoon paddy in the beginning of February.","1986","2015-06-01 18:36:01","2015-06-01 18:36:01","","123-132","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI198783002614","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Broad leaf weeds had more competition than narrow leaf weeds. The results showed that the highest grain yield (4043 kg ha -1) was obtained under weed free treatment, which had no competition because weeds were removed and wheat crop had ideal environment for growth and development. Whereas, increase in grain yield was also associated with more number of productive tillers plant -1 under weed free conditions. It is concluded that more grain yield could be obtained under weed free conditions, or keeping weeds at lower intensity to reduce their competition with main crop.","2006","2015-06-01 17:47:10","2015-06-01 17:47:10","","1-8","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20063229997","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total leaf number of each tiller in the ratoon crop was compared with Katayama's theoretical total number of leaves. The ratoon crop produced about 30% of the grain yield of the parent crop. Fertilization of the ratoon crop increased the panicle number per hill, resulting in an increased yield, Ratoon tillers were separated from the main stem to determine their tillering position on the seem, and to find the effect of fertilization on regrowth of tillers. Yield increase by fertilization was mainly due to the increase in the number of ripened secondary tillers. Tillers had 2 similar to 3 more leaves than the total leaves expected from the theory of synchronous growth of leaves and tillers. The investigation of growth of lateral buds at each growth stage of the parent crop showed that the relation between growth of the main stem and lateral bud growth of ratoon tillers was not synchronized, resulting in the increase of total leaf number over the theoretical one.","MAR  1995","2015-06-01 18:28:42","2015-06-01 18:28:42","","1-6","","1","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1995QM26400001","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results revealed that the immigration of brown planthopper in the initial stage of the first rice crop in most cases could not be traced due to low immigrant. The first generation adults used to appear during the end of April to the beginning of May, and the hopper took about one month to complete one generation up to the time of harvest of the crop in the end of June. The highest population peak in this crop season ranged from 0.60 to 10.2 with an average of 1.33 per hill, which appeared mostly during 1-2 weeks before harvest of the crop. Analysis of the factors affecting to abundance of the hopper in the first rice crop indicated that the density of over-winter population was the most important (r2 = 0.984). Besides, the number of days with the lowest day-temperature below 10.degree.C during December to Match, and the number of rainy day in April were also the factors affecting the population abundance to a certain extend. On the contrary, the population of the hopper in the second rice crop was high. The immigrant invaded into paddy fields soon after rice planting, and the peak of immigration appeared mostly during 2 to 3 weeks after rice planting. Initial population was varied from year with a range from 0.006 to 0.27 female adults per hill. The population increased from 46.6 to 2071 folds through 2 to 3 generation's multiplication to reach its highest population peak in the range of 0.6 to 450.6 per hill. The population abundance of the hopper in this crop season was highly correlated with the density of immigrant and the rainfall in September. High temperature over 34.degree.C in August was also an important factor in reducing the population abundance in this crop season. Several regression equations has been established for predicting the population abundance of the hopper both in the first and second rice crop in this area. The coefficience of determination of the regressions were higher than 0.986, indicating that they were likely to be used practically. The population characteristics of the hopper in each crop season and on ratoon rice in this area are also discussed in the paper.","1990","2015-06-01 18:32:36","2015-06-01 18:32:36","","1-26","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI199090074036","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UPAS 120) and on the uptake and availability of phosphorus (P) in an acid lateritic soil. Fourteen treatments were used: (T1) control; (T2) 100% SSP; (T3) 100% RP; (T4) T3+PSB; (T5) T3+FYM; (T6) T5+PSB; (T7) 75% RP+25% SSP; (T8) T7+PSB; (T9) T7+FYM; (T10) T9+PSB; (T11) 50% RP+50% SSP; (T12) T11+PSB; (T13) T11+FYM; and (T14) T13+PSB. Results revealed that root nodulation, growth and yield parameters were highest in the treatment which received 50% RP + 50% SSP along with FYM and PSB, which was significantly different from the treatment with 100% SSP alone. This treatment produced significantly higher seed yield (28.20 and 8.29%) over the control (no phosphorus) and 100% SSP alone, respectively. The P availability in soil was gradually increased from the initial stage in all RP-treated plots, while a decreasing trend up to harvest stage was found with 100% SSP alone. The highest P uptake in the crop was registered by the treatment with 50% RP+50% SSP in combination with FYM and PSB. This study indicated that the integrated use of the indigenous source of P (RP), SSP, FYM and PSB, besides curtailing the input cost, can effectively be used to improve the yield of the long-duration pigeon pea and to increase P availability in soil.","2007","2015-06-01 17:15:09","2015-06-01 17:15:09","","228-231","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20073030745","","","","search.grain; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was conducted to determine the population dynamics of this insect pest, factors affecting the population abundance, and the development of models for forecasting the population based on data collected from monitored fields and traps since 1985 in central Taiwan. Data indicate that the smaller brown planthopper goes through 8 generations a year, with 3 generations for each crop of rice. The population peak, regardless of planting time, appeared mostly during the milky to doughy stages of the rice. In general, macropterous adults of the smaller brown planthopper immigrated successively to paddy fields soon after transplanting. The population of immigrants was significantly higher in paddy fields planted earlier than those planted later. Since the ratio of brachypterous adults in every generation was lower then 35% both in the first and second cropping season, a portion of the newly emerged adults from the earlier planted rice either migrated to the later planted rice or drifted away in the air. In the first cropping season, the highest population of the planthopper in paddy fields was positively correlated with catches by light traps, but was significantly negatively correlated with catches by airborne net traps from May to July. Similar relationships were also observed among field populations and catches by light and airborne net traps from October to December in the second cropping season, but the correlations did not reach statistical significance. Further analysis of the factors affecting the population abundance of the planthopper showed that catches by yellow water-pan traps in ratooning rice during last December and the average temperatures from the previous December to March were the most important factors affecting the population in the first cropping season. However, catches by airborne net traps from July to August or catches by yellow water pan traps within 30 days after transplanting, average temperature and days of rainfall exceeding 10 mm/h in August, and times when a typhoon was present were the important factors affecting the population in the second cropping season. Several models for forecasting the population abundance were developed for the present study to further test their applicability.","March  2003","2015-06-01 18:25:26","2015-06-01 18:25:26","","17-33","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200300236562","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The polyploidization of rice often brings “gigas” of both vegetative organs and seeds. Howevere, in rice breeding, it is required for restoring lines to have not only big anthers but also abundant pollens. People often doubt that the enlargement of the floral organ may just be enlargement of cell size in polyploid rice. So, it is of significance to study characteristics of floral organs and pollens of several tetraploid rice varieties or lines. Floral organ and pollen characteristics of Sg99012 and HN2026 were studied comparatively by stages and different ploidy levels, with the materials 9311, HD9802S, and PA64S as the control. The results showed that chromosome doubling had much more influence on floral characteristics of every lines than seeding by stages, and the tetraploids of every lines displayed “gigas”. In correlation analysis, spikelet length, spikelet width, and anther length had significant correlation; spikelet width and anther width had significant correlation, too. Both seeding by stages and chromosome doubling made the correlations of characters between every floral organ changed to some extent. Seeding by stages had little effect on pollen diameter and fertility of HN2026-4X and Sg99012-4X. But chromosome doubling increased pollen size of every lines remarkably, and also increased the pollen quantity of PMeS (polyploid meiosis stability) restoring line HN2026-4X and gene map restoring line 9311-4X remarkably, whereas only had little effect on that of sterile lines. Moreover, chromosome doubling changed pollen fertility and made the number of fertility pollen of 9311 reduced significantly, but the pollen fertility of HN2026 (PMeS restoring line) and PA64S (sterile line) almost had no change after chromosome doubling. The results showed that tetraploid restoring lines had advantage of abundant and big size pollens, and tetraploid sterile lines had the characters of big size pollens, few change of pollen quantity and stable sterile character. These results provided evidence in reproductive biology for utilizing heterosis of polyploid rice by two-line method.","October 2009","2015-06-01 19:38:24","2015-06-01 19:38:24","","1149-1158","","10","8","","Agricultural Sciences in China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","correlation analysis; floral organ; pollen; polyploid rice; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; significance testing; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In other crops, farmers generally did not apply phosphorus. Use of other nutrients, potash, zinc etc was, however, negligible. Crops yields with farmers' parctices were lower than the yields obtained with recommended rates of nutrients with a yield gap of 9-27 per cent in different crops.

Previous concerns have been raised over the occurrence of SARA in pasture-fed dairy cattle and the potential consequences of laminitis and lameness. Highly digestible perennial rye grass contains high concentrations of rapidly fermentable carbohydrate and low concentrations of physical effective fibre that may result in SARA. This study conducted a point prevalence survey of rumen health status in grazing Irish dairy cattle fed predominantly perennial rye grass-based pasture. The survey assessed rumen fluid, animal health status, milk production data and pasture composition. A total of 144 cows between 80 and 150 days in milk were sampled on 12 farms. Eleven percent of cows were classified as affected with SARA (pH ≤ 5.5), 42% were marginal (pH 5.6-5.8) and 47% were normal (pH > 5.8). The study showed that low rumen pH is prevalent in grazing Irish dairy cattle consuming perennial rye grass-based pasture and raises concerns regarding effective pasture utilisation and possible consequences for animal health.","2008","2015-06-01 20:29:24","2015-06-01 23:58:44","","44-49","","1","176","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Dairy cow; Pasture; perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); Rumenocentesis; Rumen pH; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; Subacute ruminal acidosis; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TX (perennial N1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye#grass"")","botanical composition; cattle production; chronic diseases; dairy cows; diet; disease prevalence; disease severity; epidemiological studies; forage; grazing; health status; Irish Republic; Lolium perenne; milk yield; nutrient content; pasture plants; pathogenesis; perinatal period; periparturient diseases and disorders; pH; risk factors; rumen; ruminal acidosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an alternative to SCIT, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is now an option for patients with seasonal AR. Oralair™, a SLIT tablet containing freeze-dried allergen extracts of five grasses [cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), meadow grass (Poa pratensis), rye grass (Lolium perenne), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and timothy grass (Phleum pratense)], and Grazax™, a SLIT tablet containing a standardized extract of grass pollen allergen from timothy grass (P pratenase), are two such agents currently available in many countries. However, head-to-head comparative data are not available. In this study, an indirect comparison on efficacy, safety and cost was undertaken between Oralair™, Grazax™ and SCIT. Methods A systematic review was conducted for double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials evaluating Oralair™, Grazax™ or SCIT in patients with grass-induced seasonal AR. Using placebo as the common control, an indirect statistical comparison between treatments was performed using meta regression analysis with active drug as the primary independent variable. An economic analysis, which included both direct and indirect costs for the Canadian setting, was also undertaken. Results Overall, 20 placebo-controlled trials met the study inclusion criteria. The indirect analysis suggested improved efficacy with Oralair™ over SCIT [standardized mean difference (SMD) in AR symptom control = -0.21; P = 0.007] and Grazax™ (SMD = -0.18; P = 0.018). In addition, there were no significant differences in the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events between therapies. Oralair™ was associated with cost savings against year-round SCIT ($2471), seasonal SCIT ($948) and Grazax™ ($1168) during the first year of therapy. Conclusions Oralair™ has at least non-inferior efficacy and comparable safety against SCIT and Grazax™ at a lower annual cost.","2014","2015-06-01 20:28:28","2015-06-02 02:08:58","","225-238","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","allergic rhinitis; Grazax™; immunotherapy; Oralair™; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; subcutaneous; sublingual; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there has been considerable research on the response of sugarcane cultivars to high water tables and periodic flooding, there is a lack of information on commercial cultivar yield response to long-term flooding. An experiment was established in Belle Glade, FL to examine the effect of a 3-month summer flood (July–September) on the growth and yield of cultivars CP 80-1743 and CP 72-2086 during the plant cane (2003) and second ratoon (2005) crop. Harvest samples were taken early-, mid-, and late-season. Flooding sugarcane in the summer caused sequentially greater yield reductions throughout the harvest season in plant cane. Sucrose yields for flooded cane, compared with the non-flooded control, were 9.6 t sucrose ha−1 versus 11.7 t sucrose ha−1 early, 9.2 t sucrose ha−1 versus 12.8 t sucrose ha−1 mid-season and 7.8 t sucrose ha−1 versus 12.3 t sucrose ha−1 at late harvest. In the second ratoon crop, flooding reduced sugarcane tonnage and sucrose yield by 54–64% across sampling dates, and preliminary results indicated that flooding reduced leaf nutrient content by 10–78%. Yield reductions due to flooding in both crops were attributed more to reduced tonnage rather than sucrose content. CP 72-2086 yielded 18–28% greater sucrose than CP 80-1743 when harvested late. However the flood × cultivar interaction was not significant as both cultivars recorded similar yield reductions under flooded conditions. Our results identified severe yield losses caused by a 3-month summer flood in these cultivars, particularly in ratoon crops. Strategies to increase summer on-farm water storage in Florida should focus on short-duration periodic flooding rather than long-term flooding.","March 2008","2015-06-01 19:39:38","2015-06-01 19:39:38","","283-291","","3","95","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Flood; Florida; Growth; Nutrient concentration; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Sugarcane; Water table; Yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, there is a growing interest for the use of energy crops and various biomass sources for energy. A literature study was conducted to itemise the main potential energy crops and to compare their relative suitability and sustainability when cultivated under belgian soil and climate conditions. The characteristics taken into account for crop choice were their relative expansion in Belgium, their hardiness, their adaptability to various soils and climates, their potential use as energy crops, their productivity level, and the development of their use for biomass. Five annual crops (sugar beet, wheat, oilseed rape, Jerusalem artichoke and sweet sorghum), one perennial crop (miscanthus) and one perennial lignocellulosic crop (willow short rotation coppice SRC) were compared (Table 1). We collected information about crop ecophysiology, soil, water and temperature requirements, phytotechnical indicators (rotation, soil preparation, sowing or planting, fertilisation, weeds, pests and parasites, harvest and yields). Food and non-food potentials, together with biomass energy balance were also detailed (Table 2). Sugar beet, winter wheat and oilseed rape show more or less the same characteristics. They hardly cope with acid soils and require temperatures around 20-25degreeC for optimum growth. Their required nitrogen fertilisation is quite high to reach acceptable yields. Their energy efficiency is around 2.5-3, when the by-products, usually metabolisable by livestock, are taken into account, but goes down close to 1 when considering only the main products (bioethanol or biodiesel), because of the high energy consuming transformation cycle required to produce liquid biofuels. To compare various forms of energy, it would be useful to evaluate their relative added-value. In the present case, liquid biofuels have a larger added value than lignocellulose (higher energy content per volume unit, easier substitution to liquid fossil fuels), but this added value is difficult to quantify. Comparing all crops on the basis of the same valorisation path (for example, production of heat and electricity by biomass combustion) is theoretical and unrealistic and does not allow to evaluate an added value for the biofuels. The interest of such crops for biofuels is clearly depending on food crops overproduction and political will. Jerusalem artichoke is an interesting hardy crop, little demanding in terms of soil and water, able to grow under a wide range of weather conditions. The tubers can stand in soil during winter, allowing to harvest when time and workforce are available. Potential yields permit to reach a good energy efficiency, but cropping still encounters some problems, while the lack of experimentation makes yield prospect uncertain. The main problem of sweet sorghum and miscanthus is temperature requirements. The minimum germination temperature is round 10-12degree C (sometimes observed late in the growing season), while the optimum growing temperature is about 25 to 30degree C. These crops are very sensitive to frost and not well adapted to belgian climate. Under appropriate conditions, their energy efficiencies are satisfactory, comparable to Jerusalem artichoke. Willow (cultivated as short rotation coppice) shows many advantages, although it is water demanding. It can be grown on slightly acid soils, is harvested in the winter (when farm operations are reduced, and when all leaves have fallen on the soil, providing nutrients for the following growing seasons, so that fertilisation can be reduced). As a perennial crop, it helps to control erosion and nitrate leaching, while its yields (10 to 12 tons of oven-dry matter) allow to reach a high energy efficiency (20 to 30, depending on the chosen valorisation path). Willow seems to be a promising crop, adapted to various soil and climate conditions, less demanding for fertilisation, and highly efficient from an energy point of view. It can be burned in various heat and/or power plants, alone or combined with existing wood waste.","Jan.-Feb.,  2000","2015-06-01 17:42:44","2015-06-01 17:42:44","","59-64","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200000225166","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major sulfate sources are Lower and Middle Permian marine evaporites (δ34S of 10.9–14.4‰), but the diverse physiography of the Tularosa Basin led to a complex drainage system which contributed sulfates from various sources depending on the climate at the time of sedimentation. As inferred from sulfur isotope mass balance constraints, weathering of sulfides of magmatic/hydrothermal and sedimentary origin associated with climate oscillations during Last Glacial Maximum contributed about 35–50% of the sulfates and led to deposition of gypsum with δ34S values of −1.2‰ to 2.2‰ which are substantially lower than Permian evaporates. In the Estancia Basin, microbial sulfate reduction appears to overprint sulfur isotopic signatures that might elucidate past groundwater flows. A Rayleigh distillation model indicates that about 3–18% of sulfates from an inorganic groundwater pool (δ34S of 12.6–13.8‰) have been metabolized by bacteria and preserved as partially to fully reduced sulfur-bearing minerals species (elemental sulfur, monosulfides, disulfides) with distinctly negative δ34S values (−42.3‰ to −20.3‰) compared to co-existing gypsum (−3.8‰ to 22.4‰). For the Tularosa Basin microbial sulfate reduction had negligible effect on δ34S value of the gypsiferous sediments most likely because of higher annual temperatures (15–33 °C) and lower organic carbon content (median 0.09%) in those sediments leading to more efficient oxidation of H2S and/or smaller rates of sulfate reduction compared to the saline playas of the Estancia Basin (5–28 °C; median 0.46% of organic carbon). The White Sands region of the Tularosa Basin is frequently posited as a hydrothermal analogue for Mars. High temperatures of groundwater (33.3 °C) and high δ18O(H2O) values (1.1‰) in White Sands, however, are controlled predominantly by seasonal evaporation rather than the modern influx of hydrothermal fluids. Nevertheless, it is possible that some of the geochemical processes in White Sands, such as sulfide weathering during climate oscillations and upwelling of highly mineralized waters, might be considered as valid terrestrial analogues for the sulfate cycle in places such as Meridiani Planum on Mars.","October 15, 2009","2015-06-01 19:24:57","2015-06-01 19:24:57","","6162-6186","","20","73","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fertilizer S addition increased sulphate concentrations, but in a few months, they decreased again because of plant uptake, leaching and incorporation into organic matter. In the absence of cellulose, total dry matter production in rye-grass roots and tops increased up to twofold by S application, and a significant correlation was observed between soil inorganic sulphate at the start of the experiment and plant S uptake (r = 0.72). The presence of a readily available C source inhibited the uptake of both S and 35S. C addition equivalent to 10 t straw ha−1 caused immobilization and rapidly decreasing amounts of soil inorganic sulphate. Thus, plant yield, S-uptake and leaching losses were lower than in soils without C addition. During the season, the contribution of fertilizer-S to plants decreased from 46 to 26% in material sampled 84–182 d after sowing, irrespective of soil type and C addition.

As panicle number of the ratoon rice crop depends on the effective tillers of the previous crop and on the activity of axillary buds on mother culms, the optimum population is 350 000 effective tillers/mu at most. For a crop which is to be ratooned, it is essential to raise strong seedlings with 2 or more tillers/plant at a sowing rate of 10-20 kg/mu and to transplant the seedlings at the 7- to 8-leaf stage. It is recommended that fertilizer applications to the rice nursery be 20-30% higher than the usual rate. The optimum spacing is 23.1 * 13.2 to 20 * 20 cm with 2-3 seedlings/hill. In transplanted paddy fields, organic manure should be increased by 40%. Field management is very important for high yield of both the rice crop and its ratoon crop in the period from 1 month before to 1 month after harvest.

Kuprijanov (1922 to 1926) has long been cultivated in mountainous parts of North Caucasus and from here was evidently introduced into Turkey and Armenia by immigrating natives (1864). It is valued for its relative earliness among other perennial rye forms, and its compact and vigorously tillering bush of prostrate shape. It retains green stems and leaves at full grain maturity, thus being of particular value for forage and pasture. Low drought resistance, prolonged maturation, susceptibility to fungi and fragility of ear lower its quality as a grain crop. Winterhardiness is still to be ascertained. Individual selection has given good results, namely, forms with simultaneous maturation of grain, and spring and highly drought resistant forms. High self-fertility of S. Kuprijanovi makes it easy to split populations into sections. As it crosses readily with other annual and perennial ryes, further improvement of 5. Kuprijanovi is thought to be possible through hybridization. In F 1 generation perenniality is dominant, but this seems to be linked with winterness and fragility of ear.-M.A.O.","1935","2015-06-01 17:39:55","2015-06-01 17:39:55","","159-65","","14","A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19360701444","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lines included were: AT3425 (putatively Triticum aestivum * Thinopyrum ponticum [ Elymus elongatus]), BFPMC1 ( Thinopyrum intermedium [ Elymus hispidus]), Permontra ( Secale cereale * S. montanum), PI-368149, PI-368150 ( Triticum turgidum * S. montanum), Spitzer, TA12252 ( S. montanum) and Varimontra (reselection of Permontra). Two seeds were planted into one-inch balls of moistened soil collected from SBWMV- and WSSMV-infested fields or a mixture of both soils (for co-inoculation). Two dozen soil balls per genotype per soil inoculum were planted into microplots of previously non-infested soil confined by fibreglass barriers at Tailby field, Ithaca, New York, USA in October 2001. Plants were inspected for virus-like symptoms in May, September and October 2002. All genotypes, except Spitzer, were considered to be at least moderately susceptible to one or both viruses based on the observation of typical disease symptoms in some inoculated plants. ELISA was used to confirm visual symptoms observed in May 2002. For SBWMV, ELISA confirmed infection of AT3425, PI-368149, TA12252 and Varimontra. For WSSMV, ELISA confirmed infection of AT3425 and Permontra. ELISA also confirmed co-infection of AT3425, BFPMC1, Permontra, PI-368149, PI-368150, TA12252 and Varimontra by SBWMV and WSSMV. None of the singly inoculated plants were co-infected. Strikingly, co-inoculation resulted in increased infection by both viruses. No symptoms were observed during autumn 2002, even though autumn temperatures were similar to those that were conducive for symptom development in the spring. No plants, whether infected by virus or not, survived the following winter for unknown reasons.

Yields have become stagnant and legumes are frequently advocated as an affordable option for resource poor farmers, to enhance productivity. Farmer participatory research was employed to test legume intensification as a means to improve maize-based systems in Malawi. A range of,options were evaluated, from grain/legume intercrops of. long-duration pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) rotated with maize (Zea mays), to a relay green manure system of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Fishbean). Two years of on-farm experimentation indicated that under on-farm conditions legume-intensified systems produced residues that contained about 50 kg N/ha per year, two-fold higher than sole-cropped maize residues. Grain yields from legume-intensified systems were comparable to yields from continuous sole maize, even in a dry lakeshore ecology. These preliminary findings were linked to farmer assessment, where farmers participating in the trials expressed strong interest in the technologies. Yet the probability of adoption remains uncertain. Associated surveys outlined constraints and trade-offs underlying technology choice, information that is not usually considered in conjunction with on-farm trials. Although the legumes were highly productive, farmers expressed worries about the marginal loss of maize production. While the trial performance was similar across regions, differences in market condition, farm resources and household composition appears to stimulate different technology choices. Farmers weigh the benefits of weed suppression and potential cash earnings, against the costs of seed, problems of seed access, labor requirements and problems of grain market access and price. Surveyed farmers commonly manage residues by burning. Promotion and experimentation with more efficient use of legume residues may offer higher short-term impacts than efforts to promote adoption of another cash crop. Ultimately, adoption and soil fertility benefits may depend on market returns to legume production. This study documents the value of researchers and farmers partnering in evaluation of technologies, adoption constraints and competing technology choices.","SEP  2002","2015-06-01 17:15:25","2015-06-02 02:09:05","","159-174","","1-3","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000178112700014","","","","Adoption constraints; AGRICOLA; Female-headed households; ""long duration"" W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR ""pigeonpea""); Malawi; Resource management; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.grain; search.pigeonpea; search.rice; Soil fertility; Southern Africa; SPV; Tephrosia vogelii; TITLE-ABS-KEY (""long duration"" W/1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon?pea"" OR pigeonpea)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); TX (""long duration"" N1 (cajanus OR ""pigeon#pea"")); WOS","Arachis hypogaea; Cajanus; Cajanus cajan; costs and returns; cropping systems; crop residues; crop yield; farming systems; green manures; innovation adoption; intercropping; labor; Malawi; nitrogen content; prescribed burning; prices; soil fertility; soil management; technology; technology transfer; weed control; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sward performance and seasonal animal [Hereford steers] production from the sorghums were assessed at stocking rates of 1.50, 2.50, 3.00 and 3.25 beasts ha-1. The pastures established in 1974 were grazed continuously from January 1975 to April 1976. The pastures sown in 1976 were grazed from January 1977 to June 1977. Swards were then spelled over winter and again grazed from January 1978 to April 1978. The cultivars differed little in annual sward productivity under grazing, though Silk produced more green material and had higher dry matter yields during the cool season. Swards of Crooble and Silk had less weed content during the second season. Total yield, green yield and sorghum yield decreased with increasing stocking rate. The superior growth of Silk in cool weather was reflected in least liveweight loss at this time. At other times of the year, there were no differences between cultivars in animal performance. The thermal regime dominated overall pasture productivity, regardless of species composition of swards, and this productivity was reflected in animal production. Average daily liveweight gain per animal over all cultivars and stocking rates reached 0.83 kg in one 112-day period. For a continuous 336-day period, average liveweight gain per animal was ca. 130 kg, equivalent to ca. 340 kg ha-1. Liveweight gain per animal or per hectare was reduced with increased stocking rate in the cooler months but, in summer, gain per hectare increased with stocking rate.","1988","2015-06-01 17:43:18","2015-06-01 17:43:18","","1-22","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI198886022452","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an incremental step towards dissecting the genetics of perennialism, a segregating F4 heterogeneous inbred family derived from a cross between S. bicolor and S. propinquum was phenotyped in both field and greenhouse environments for traits related to over-wintering and rhizome formation. An unseasonably cold winter in 2011 provided high selection pressure, and hence 74.8 % of the population did not survive. This severe selection pressure for cold tolerance allowed the resolution of two previously unidentified over-wintering quantitative trait locus (QTL) and more powerful correlation models than previously reported. Conflicting with previous reports, a maximum of 33 % of over-wintering variation could be explained by above-ground shoot formation from rhizomes; however, every over-wintering plant exhibited rhizome growth. Thus, while rhizome formation is required for over-wintering, other factors also determine survival in this interspecific population. The fine mapping of a previously reported rhizome QTL on sorghum chromosome SBI-01 was conducted by targeting this genomic region with additional simple sequence repeat markers. Fine mapping reduced the 2-LOD rhizome QTL interval from similar to 59 to similar to 14.5 Mb, which represents a 75 % reduction in physical distance and a 53 % reduction in the number of putative genes in the locus.","2013","2015-06-01 20:41:47","2015-06-01 23:57:07","","153-162","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","AGRICOLA; Perennialism; Perenniality; Rhizomes; Scopus; search.sorghum; sorghum; Sorghum propinquum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","cold; cold tolerance; cultivars; genes; loci; models; overwintering; quantitative trait loci; rhizomes; risk; shoots; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum halepense; winter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reactors were operated in parallel at 3 different temperatures, 10, 15 and 37 °C. Hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis were assessed by VS degradation, by soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and by methane production, respectively. Hydrolysis was the rate-limiting step at all temperatures and the rates and extent of hydrolysis were considerably lower at 15 and 10 °C, than at 37 °C. The total VS degradation was 53%, 34% and 19% at 37, 15 and 10 °C, respectively. Acidification was not affected by temperature and VFA production and consumption was balanced in all cases, except at 10 °C. Methane yields were 0.215 m 3 CH 4 kg -1 VS -1 added, 0.160 m 3 CH 4 kg -1 VS -1 added and 0.125 m 3 CH 4 kg -1 VS -1 added at 37, 15 and 10 °C, respectively. Methanogenesis was not strongly affected at 15 °C but it became rate-limiting at 10 °C. Overall, the solid degradation and methane production performance under psychrophilic conditions was encouraging and greater than previously reported.

Under Moscow district conditions, the stage of vernalization in winter wheat, rye, and perennial grasses ends at the end of Oct. and the beginning of Nov., depending on external conditions, sowing period, and variety. The winter qualities of plants are conditioned at the general stage of vernalization, but winter hardiness is a combination of processes within the plant organism. Perennial grasses must go through the stage of vernalization every year regardless of whether they blossomed in the previous years. Passage through the stage of vernalization precedes the bearing of all seeds by shoots of perennial grasses. In view of the absence of sufficient stores of organic substances, fescue and clover cannot experience the stage of vernalization in the seed, but go through it in phases 3 to 5 of the leaves.","1955","2015-06-01 17:37:49","2015-06-01 17:37:49","","104-115","","(22)","1955","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19583200021093","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During 1975-84 the use of chemical fertilizers increased fairly steadily due to government promotion and farmers' readiness to accept new technology. Farmers tend to use fertilizers in irregular quantities and often only on their poorest fields. Irrigation appears to be a major factor leading to increased fertilizer use, and more irrigation will have to be provided if the use of fertilizer is to become more widespread. In most cases the ingredients of fertilizers are imported and mixed locally with a filler. Demand for fertilizer depends largely on its price and producer prices of crops. 52% of total fertilizers consumed during the 1981/82-1983/84 cropping seasons were used for rice, while perennials and vegetables accounted for 14% and 12% respectively. The price of fertilizers in Thailand is higher than in other neighbouring countries. The use of fertilizers largely depends upon either the low price of fertilizer or the high price of agricultural products.","1985","2015-06-01 17:28:23","2015-06-01 17:28:23","","566-574","","12","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19861830754","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first experiment was set up on lupine fallow with a K base, the second on an NK base. The superphosphate was applied as follows: the powdered variety was scattered at the rate of 60 kg P2O5/hectare and the granulated placed in the rows at the rate of 10-20 kg P2O5/hectare. The experimental crops were rye and barley followed by perennial grasses. The granulated Pc gave rises in the yield similar to those resulting from powdered Pc. Applying small doses of Pc in the rows raised the rye and barley yields, and their quality, and the yields of the perennial grasses which followed them. On unlimed soil in the majority of cases granulated Pc had no particular advantage over the powdered.

The Highlands include 24,000,000 acres on the Tropic of Capricorn and 100 to 300 miles inland. The rainfall averages 26 inches with monsoon rains in summer and dry winters. The mean minimum temperaute is 58[degree]F. and the mean maximum 85[degree]. There are 310 frost-free days. The open downs country which requires practically no clearing is undulating (2[degree] to 5[degree] slopes) and potentially erosive, hence strip cropping is the ideal system. Cultivated crops include grain or sweet sorghum, wheat, linseed and sunflower. Oats are used for a winter grazing crop. Sorghum and wheat yield 60 bu. per acre when properly managed and sorghum is especially valuable because it may ratoon for 4 or 5 years. Stubble mulching on the fallow land is necessary. Land with soil less than two feet deep is risky, three and four feet are better so as to store plenty of water. Also it is necessary to avoid land with stone underlying the surface. The proper size of a living area seems to lie between 1500 and 5000 areas. At present three acres are required per sheep but this can be reduced to one acre by proper handling and 2500 to 3000 sheep afford a reasonable living. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T. L.

A.","The anophelogenic significance of water wild rice sprouts in reservoirs","Med Parazitol I Parazitarn Bolezni","","","","","Observations made in shallow water portions of various reservoirs (Uchinsk, Karpovsk) in 1956 disclosed that thickets of annual rice which have floating leaves at the beginning of development are anophelogenic. During the full vegetative stage the rice darkens large areas of the water, but in many sections it grows as thin thickets where hairweed and Elodea (water thyme) grow and promote the development of the Anopheles mosquitoes. If the rice is not cut annually, when it dies off, conditions are created which favor the development of algae. Calculations showed that the anophelogeni-city of rice does not exceed that of the control plots. It is recommended that agrotechnical measures be taken in order to increase the height and density of the thickets; and also that the rice be harvested as late as possible. No fertilizers should be used because they stimulate hairweed. Perennial rice crops are not favorable for Anopheles larvae, since they form dense thickets which reach a height of 3 to 3-1/2 m; their powerful stems and wide leaves form a dense shade and the perennial rice competes successfully not only with submerged vegetation but also with lineides. Mosquito larvae are very sparse in these thickets. Only harvested sections had anophelogenic importance, but when the rice grew again the anophelogenicity dropped rapidly. The abundance of larvae in these patches is determined by the method of rice harvesting. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Transl. from Referat. Zhur.

W.","The banana","Queensland Agric Jour","","","","","Bananas have been planted in Queensland since 1867 and extend from the southern border northward 1200 miles to Mossman. Plantings in 1952-53 were estimated at 8707 acres. The banana plant consists of a thick pseudostem above the true stem or rhizome. The pseudostem consists of leaf bases which protect new leaves and developing flowers. Sucker buds arise in leaf axils on opposite sides of the stem. Roots are cord-like and fleshy and few go deeper than 30 inches in the soil. Flowers and resultant fruit develop on the terminus of the corm which pushes up through the pseudostem. The flowers are potentially bisexual but differentiate to female, hermapheodite and male; cultivated bananas produce fruit without pollination and make no seed. Flowers may be laid down about 4 mos. after planting but in southern Queensland it is better if initiation comes at the end of cold weather, or about 8 mos. after planting the first of January. If initiated before cold weather the fruit may be stunted and is called ""November dump"". Fruit initiated in September is thrown or shoots in January or February and is ready to harvest from April to June. The main vars. are Cavendish, Mosn Mari and Williams Hybrid, Lady Finger, Sugar and Anamalu. Lady Finger and Sugar are susceptible to Panama Disease; Cavendish is resistant. Cavendish is 6 ft. tall and sturdy, the others vary from 8 to 16 ft. and either require propping when the fruit is filling or are too tall to make it practical. Mons Mari and Williams Hybrid are mutants of Cavendish adapted to high altitudes. Between 50 and 100 inches of rain, a high temperature with freedom from frost, and protection from wind are required. A perennial legume such as pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan, is used as a cover crop. If the first growth is cut back at 12 months regrowth will suppress weeds and may be left several years. Banana planting material includes butts, the corms with part of the pseudostem from a matured or nearly matured plant, suckers which are offshoots from the parent plant, and most commonly used planting material, and bits which are obtained by splitting the corm of a 6-month old plant so each half has a good bud or eye. Extra buds and the original growing point are gouged out. Planting in southern Queensland about January 1 gives best results. The taller vars. are planted earlier than the dwarf. Banana plants are allowed from 81 to 196 square feet of space. Bananas will make several ratoon crops selecting 2 or 3 sucker or follower plants the first year and one each succeeding year. Desuckering and thrashing or removal of dead leaves is a monthly task. Bunches of fruit maturing during the winter must be covered to prevent blemishes [long dash]open ended cloth or paper sacks are used. The bunch is ready to cut when the fruit is evenly rounded without prominent ribs and flowers readily rub off. Bananas are allowed to sweat 8 hours in the shed and packed in 1-1/4 bu. cases as ""singles"" or less commonly as hands. The fruit is cut green and artificially ripened with coal gas or other material. To prevent spread of disease bananas are grown under regulation, and diseased and old plants must be eradicated. They are dug out by hand or injected with hormone plant killer in the summer. To clear an acre 5 gallons of 1% solution are required, following up with 0.2% solution in spray form on surviving suckers. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T. L.

Under Hungarian conditions the overwintered uredospores of the rust may sometimes be found on winter cereals (rye) and perennial wild grasses, e.g., Dactylis glomerata and Poa pratensis, in the very early spring (23rd and 25th March, 1930). Teleutospores may be formed as early as a fortnight after the first appearance of the uredospores. The teleutospores do not germinate until they have overwintered under natural conditions; those passing the winter on straw in barns or granaries cannot be germinated. As a rule the teleutospores lose their viability in a few months, but when kept in the cold they may retain it for almost a year [cf. R.A.M., ix, p. 365]. During the excessively cold winter of 1928-9 (mini-mum temperature during February in Hungary -32degreesC.) the teleutospores remained viable and infected the barberries in the following spring, resulting in a severe epidemic of black rust on the cereals. In places liable to rigorous winter weather late developing uredospores of P. graminis may in exceptional cases persist until the spring in a viable condition on manure heaps or the like; protection from the frost may further be given by the snow cover. Spring infections may also arise in Hungary through the agency of uredospores which are not of local origin but are borne by the prevailing south, south-east, and south-west winds from southerly regions, e.g., the Balkans and northern Italy [cf. ibid., viii, p. 364]. Although P. graminis is not absolutely dependent on the barberry for its persistence, there can be no doubt, in the writer's opinion, that systematic barberry eradication would have a considerable effect in reducing black rust of cereals.","1930","2015-06-01 17:40:09","2015-06-01 17:40:09","","615-637","","6","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19311100595","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Thysanoptera, Phloeothripidae) in northern Kazakhstan","Entomol Obozrenie [transl]","","","","","The wheat thrips (Haplothrips tritici Kurd.) is widely distributed in northern Kazakhstan where it colonizes all the spring wheat sowings on the newly opened lands and attains large numbers on them. The main sources of colonization of new sowings are the spring wheat fields situated on old plowlands. The other sources from which wheat thrips can migrate are the virgin lands and fallow lands of varying age, mainly those under couch-grass. The start of the flight of the thrips in northern Kazakhstan coincides with stalk formation in spring wheat, and flight coincides with the beginning of spike-formation. The colonization of plants by thrips takes place exactly at the phase of loosening of the sheath, when they have the ""opportunity to penetrate into the young spike still hidden under the leaves. The timing of the egg laying to the period between the start of loosening of the sheath and full ripening of the wheat plants causes constant migrations of adult thrips from plant to plant within the field, as well as to other fields outside it. Migration is effected passively by wind. Extended sowing of winter wheat creates favorable conditions for egg-laying by the thrips owing to the longer time the wheat plants are in the selected phase of development. Late sowings usually act as bait crops and there is a concentration of egg-laying females on them. Fecundity is low and amounts to 20-22 eggs/female. The larvae attain their greatest numbers on spring wheat during grain formation. By the start of harvest, the vast majority of them have migrated into the soil for wintering. Survival during overwintering and metamorphosis varies greatly in different fields and largely depends on the modes of soil and crops cultivation, which determine both the moisture-temperature regime in the soil and on its surface, and also the vertical distribution of the larvae in the soil. In northern Kazakhstan the greatest mortality among the larvae (65-75%) in the wintering period was brought about by stubble-harrowing in autumn. A relatively smaller mortality among the larvae (30 to 60%) was produced by autumn plowing. On perennial grass fields, untilled in autumn, the mortality among the larvae did not exceed 25-47%. In the period of metamorphosis in the stubble mortality in fallow fields reached 53%, on spring wheat sowings 39%, and on perennial grasses only 12%. The application of the Mal'tsev system of soil cultivation, the extension of sowings of annual grasses in place of half-cover sowings of perennial grasses and the shortening of the sowing period for spring wheat create the requisite conditions for reducing the numbers of wheat thrips in northern Kazakhstan. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ","1958","2015-06-01 17:53:32","2015-06-01 17:53:32","","678-688","","(4)","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19603500025317","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1954-56, when observations were made, the adults appeared in mid-June and the females laid up to 20-22 eggs each on the immature ears. The nymphs hatched at the beginning of July, at the time of grain formation, but left the ears before harvest and hibernated either in the soil, at a depth of about 4 in., or in the stubble near the roots. In May, they came to the upper soil layer for pupation, and nymphs, pupae and adults were all observed in the soil in June. Considerable mortality occurred during metamorphosis, 53.7, 39.7 and 12 per cent. of the thrips dying in fallow, wheat and perennial grass fields, respectively; though temperature and moisture in the last were more favourable for development. Autumn ploughing resulted in 30-60 per cent. mortality of the overwintering nymphs, and breaking up the soil, which exposed them to frost, gave 65-75 per cent. kill. The rotation of wheat with annual grasses instead of with perennial ones is recommended, and further control can be gained by shortening the sowing period, thus reducing the time favourable for oviposition.","1958","2015-06-01 17:53:34","2015-06-01 17:53:34","","785-797","","pt. 4","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19610500535","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","The Black Beetle ( Alissonotum impressicolle Arr.), a Pest of Sugarcane in Myitkyina District in Northern Burma.","Indian Journal of Agricultural Science","","","","","Alissonotum impressicolle, Arr., is a serious pest of sugar-cane in a district about 300 miles north of Mandalay in northern Burma. Brief notes are given on the characters of soil and climate in the district; the beetle has not so far been abundant where the soil is highly acid. It occurs in association with elephant grasses both in Assam and Burma (where the preponderant species are Saccharum arundinaceum and Imperata arundinacea[Imperata cylindrica], among the roots of which the larvae are common), but has also been found on high, well-drained lands without any elephant grass. It was first recorded as a pest of sugar-cane in Assam in 1919 and in Burma in 1927. S. Takano, in a communication to the author, stated that in Formosa it is a pest of sugar-cane in unirrigated districts in the south and causes most injury in May and June; cane planted from January to April suffers severely but that planted from July to October is little affected. In northern Formosa, cane is an irrigated crop grown in rotation with rice, and most of the larvae die during the rainy season from December to March. Crops are rarely ratooned. Campsomeris (Elis) annulata, F., which also occurs in Burma, destroys about 1.5 per cent, of the larvae. In Burma, eggs are laid in the soil from late September to early December and hatch in about 2-21/2 weeks. Larvae are capable of feeding and developing on humus, but in sugar-cane fields they live among and feed on the roots, and so are not affected by the cultivation of the soil between the rows. They only become a pest when conditions are favourable for breeding in the field, as when ratooning is long continued. Pupation and adult emergence begin in early and mid-March, respectively. The adults are active until late June or early July, gnawing the shoots of cane, and then rest until late September, when oviposition begins. They are dead by December. If drought occurs while the beetles are active, feeding decreases, but is renewed with heavy showers of rain. When in want of food, they migrate in numbers. They are slightly repelled by strong lights. Collections at the beginning of the season showed that the sexes were about equal in number, but later females greatly outnumbered males. Females probably lay about 100 eggs, depositing them a few at a time and often at intervals of several days. Details are given of the extent and nature of the damage caused by this Dynastid. In 1932, it was estimated that 12-75 larvae occurred under each root over large areas of ratoon cane. The variety of sugar-cane chiefly grown up to 1932 shows some slight resistance to attack, but ratoons well, third ratoon being commonly taken and sometimes fourth and fifth, which encourages the infestation. Four other varieties, which are less resistant but which can only be ratooned once, are now recommended. Natural enemies of the larvae, none of which appears to be of much importance, include various birds, the Asilid, Philodicus femoralis, Ric., Campsomeris annulata, a Tachinid parasite, several Carabid predators, and the fungus, Metanhizium anisopliae. An account is given of experiments on control in which various baits for the adults were ineffective, and soil fumigants against the larvae did not give results good enough to justify their use. Flooding the fields with water only killed a small percentage of the larvae. A rotary plough, working down to about 4 ins., destroyed 40 per cent, of the larvae and exposed others to birds. The only measure that has so far given any practical result is the restriction of ratooning and the introduction of a fallow period of at least a year. Infestation is negligible if cane is grown as an annual crop in rotation with non-cereal crops. The possibilities of control by hand collection of the beetles or by introducing natural enemies are discussed.",", December 1937","2015-06-01 19:05:48","2015-06-01 19:05:48","","907-931","","pt. 6","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19380500673","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In more extensive experiments in 1928 under different soil moisture conditions, the sugars in corn (King Philip Hybrid) decreased from amounts varying from about 8.5 to nearly 18% at the blossom stage down to amounts, with one exception, below 2.5% at maturity. This suggests a movement of sugars to the ear during the maturing of the crop. Sugars in sorghum (White Durra) with but few exceptions remained above 16% from bloom to maturity, with many of the samples being over 30% There are indications that sorghums cut back at maturity make new shoot growth at the expense of sugars stored in the roots. In corn plants without seed-bearing ears at maturity in 1930 the sugar percentages were consistently higher in both roots and stalks than in those plants with seed-bearing ears. This was especially true in regard to stalks. These data are consistent with the view that corn is physiologically an annual while sorghums are perennials.","December 1937","2015-06-01 17:45:14","2015-06-01 23:56:13","","1014-1021","","12","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19381200001630","","","","AGRICOLA; search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); TX (perennial N1 sorghum); WOS","carbohydrates; chemical constituents of plants; roots; Zea mays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whole-farm simulation analyses using the APSIM and GRAZPLAN models at nine locations across southern Australia have evaluated the likely trade-offs among expected profitability, financial risk, soil erosion risk, deep drainage and soil carbon change as annual pastures are converted to perennial pastures based on a C-3 grass, a C-4 grass or lucerne. Differences between perennial and annual feedbases in total pasture growth (median -11%, range -47% to +20%) and metabolisable energy supply from pasture (median +1%, range -48% to +52%) were diverse across locations and perennial species. At some locations, improvements in the pasture feedbase were counter-balanced by lower livestock intakes from crop stubbles. The modelled farming system with the highest profit included some perennial pasture at seven of the nine locations, but no one pasture species or land-use system predominated across all locations or producer risk attitudes. Local characteristics of the soils and farming systems are as important as broad climatic factors in determining how substituting perennial for annual pastures alters the trade-off between profitability and wind erosion risk. Further expanding permanent pastures into land currently used for crops only unequivocally reduced wind erosion risk at the four locations with Mediterranean climates. Lucerne grown in long rotations provided the best trade-off between mean gross margin and financial risk at Merriwagga and Temora. Permanent C-3 or C-4 perennial grass pastures separated from continuous cropping may simultaneously increase profits and reduce business and erosion risk at low-rainfall locations with Mediterranean climates, as long as they can be managed to persist. Managing pastures for greater nitrogen inputs could be considered as an erosion-abatement strategy.","2014","2015-06-01 17:45:34","2015-06-01 17:45:34","","2029-2041","","11-12","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000344459900020","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the early 1990s, decollectivisation of agriculture, allocation of forestry land to households, and the development of market networks transformed land use in the mountains of Vietnam, leading to an increase in forest area. We used census and geographic data covering the whole country at a fine level of aggregation to build a spatial lag regression model of reforestation. We separated natural forest regrowth from the increase in plantation forests. The forest transition theory distinguishes between the forest scarcity and economic development paths. Our study suggests that the forest scarcity path was in part at work in Vietnam: new policies allocating forestry land to households, local scarcity of forest products, and development of remote demand for timber contributed to forest cover increases. The evidence regarding the economic development path are more ambiguous, as there was no depopulation or agricultural decline in marginal regions. We propose a third forest transition path that better corresponds to Vietnam's situation: a smallholder agricultural intensification path. In marginal regions, land scarcity associated with population growth, land degradation, and political restrictions led to, on one hand, a decline in cultivation on hillsides followed by reforestation and, on the other hand, an increase in labour inputs on the plots with the highest agro-ecological potential. The development of markets for agricultural inputs and outputs did also contribute to reforestation by raising agricultural productivity in mountain paddies and maize fields. This reinforced the concentration of agriculture on the most suitable land.","April 2008","2015-06-01 19:24:53","2015-06-01 19:24:53","","182-197","","2","25","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural intensification; Forestry; Forest transition; Land abandonment; Land allocation; Land use change; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Reforestation; ScienceDirect; search.rice; Spatial lag regression; SPV; Vietnam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This adaptive response, named cold acclimation, involves many physiological and biochemical changes that mainly rely on reprogramming gene expression. Currently, the best documented genetic pathway leading to gene induction under low temperature conditions is the one mediated by the Arabidopsis C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factors (CBFs), a small family of three transcriptional activators (CBF1-3) that bind to the C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element, which is present in the promoters of many cold-responsive genes, and induce transcription. The CBF genes are themselves induced by cold. Different evidences indicate that the CBF transcriptional network plays a critical role in cold acclimation in Arabidopsis.

Then, ten 3rd- to 4th-instar nymphs or 3-5 day-old male and female adult leafhoppers were inoculated on each host plant and exposed for 48 h. The number of feeding marks on a host plant was not consistent with the suitability of the plant to the leafhopper. The occurrence of feeding marks on preferable host plants is arranged in the following order: ratoon paddy > paddy > leersia > grass > barnyard grass > dent foxtail. The combinations of probing stimulant, sucking stimulant, nutrients within the plant juice and the physical characters of the plant cuticles for feeding mark formation may result in this inconsistency. The honeydew from the most favorable host plants, including paddy ratoon paddy, barnyard grass, leersia grass and dent foxtail contains more carbohydrates and amino acids than the others. Estimation of carbohydrates and amino acid content in honeydew provides a simple and rapid bioassay method for the evaluation of suitability of plants to green rice leafhopper.","1981","2015-06-01 18:40:02","2015-06-01 18:40:02","","243-254","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI198375032957","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further research work, carried out at the Rothamsted Expt. Station and elsewhere showed that a substantial increase in the current rates of N applications for spring sown wheat and barley, and for the early spring topdressing of winter wheat, would aid materially in reducing losses from this disease. Another method of control, called the Chamberlain system, consisted of sowing trefoil (Medicago bysulina) and Italian rye grass along with the barley. After the barley is harvested, the trefoil utilizes the available nitrogen in the soil and thereby helps starve out the causal organism. Plowing under the straw left by the combine is considered helpful provided additional nitrogen is used at time of sowing the succeeding crop. In conclusion, the author points out the necessity of keeping the land free of perennial grass weeds which may harbor the fungus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T. J.

Also samples of serum were exhaustively absorbed with solid-phase allergens and the supernatants tested to determine the reactivity of the remaining IgE antibodies. Three patterns of reactivity were observed: (1) June, orchard, meadow fescue, and perennial rye grasses displayed similar reactivity in both inhibition and absorption studies; (2) sweet vernal and Bermuda grasses were considerably less reactive with the serum pool, indicating that they lacked antigenic determinants possessed by the other grasses; and (3) timothy grass possessed unique antigenic determinants.

The older view that rice was domesticated around the Bay of Bengal and in parts of mainland Southeast Asia has been replaced by competing views of earliest domestication in that region and in the Yangzi valley. Botanical considerations point clearly to the retention of perennial characteristics while archaeological and historical evidences point to cultivation with more than a single harvest from an initial planting – the practice of ratooning. Evidence is reviewed briefly for China and more extensively for Southeast Asia. Modern field evidence is used to support the notion that ratooning was probably more widespread in the past and that this practice may represent an early phase in the history of rice agriculture in Southeast Asia as it does in China.","April 2010","2015-06-01 19:37:36","2015-06-01 23:54:14","","215-223","","2","36","","Journal of Historical Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asian prehistory; History of early agriculture; Perennial crops; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice cultivation; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rice; Southeast Asia; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1949, preliminary work was begun on the physiology of perishing in the vegetative organs in annual grasses. Two annuals (Hostianum 237 winter wheat, and Tarasanskaja winter rye), and 2 perennials (cultivated rye and wild rye, Secale anatolicum) were grown. The leaf lamina, leaf sheath and internodes were studied in regard to changes in vitality and water content (estimated, visually, by change in colour from green to yellow and by relative turgidity) at different stages of seed ripening, namely, 14 June (beginning of seed setting), 3 July (wax ripeness), 11 July (full ripeness), and 4 August (over-ripeness). For economy of space the data obtained are given (in tables) only for Hostianum 237 and wild rye. The figures are discussed in relation to the transfer of nutrient substances from the vegetative organs to the seeds, with special reference to the fact that the perennials are reproduced by seeds and by vegetative reproduction, whereas the annuals are reproduced by seeds only. Dying-off in perennials is characterized by two phases of perishing in the leaves. The first coincides with the onset of seed setting and takes place in the lowest leaves of the stem, proceeding (as in annuals) from the base upwards; the second coincides with seed filling and ripening, but starts in the upper leaves, and proceeds downwards. It is concluded that this characteristic of the perennials may be useful in selection studies.-M.H.","1951","2015-06-01 17:38:09","2015-06-01 17:38:09","","1037-50","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19521700604","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In perennial ryegrass, the putative defence activator Bion was also tested. Resistance was measured as regrowth of plants after inoculation with M. nivale and incubation in darkness at 2°C. In winter wheat, pre-treatment with chitosan at 1000 μg per plant increased resistance to subsequent infection by M. nivale, but this effect was less significant in a replicate experiment. Chitosan-treated winter wheat plants expressed the gene for the pathogenesis-related protein chitinase at higher levels than non-treated plants. Chitinase gene expression was also stimulated by M. nivale infection in winter wheat. Perennial ryegrass pre-treated with Bion or chitosan and inoculated with M. nivale did not display better regrowth after incubation than non-treated, inoculated plants. Rather, regrowth was reduced in some of the Bion-treated plants after incubation.

In 1979 wet season, clipping experiments at IRRI using a randomized complete block design. Results showed that tillering increased from 10 to 14 per hill where half of each panicle was removed and reduced from 10 to 6 per hill where half of each leaf was removed. These effects were further confirmed in the following dry season trial, which also showed that late clipping of the panicles (at soft dough stage) may lessen the increase in ratooning. Plant analysis of the rice stubble (0 to 15 cm above ground level) and roots of the main crop at harvest showed that the number of ratoon tillers produced to significantly relate to % carbohydrate (anhydroglucose) content.

A soil loosener affected the top 8-12 cm under perennial herbage and the top 10-12 cm under winter and spring crops. Compared with shallow loosening, deep loosening improved soil structure, increased aeration and decreased the compaction and volume-weight of the soil. Deep loosening greatly reduced the formation of cracks on the soil surface. Evaporation was decreased by deep loosening but not by shallow loosening to 1-2 cm. Deep loosening to 8-12 cm improved the moisture regime of the soil compared with shallow loosening. Deep loosening improved the nutrient regime and the water permeability and destroyed the greatest number of weeds. Harrowing destroyed the greatest number of crop plants. Deepening the depth of loosening from 1-2 cm to 4-6 cm and 10-12 cm increased the yield of winter wheat. Deep loosening was most effective for winter wheat and perennial herbage when spring-summer rainfall was insufficient. Shallow loosening was ineffective.

The yields in NPK and NK plots varied closely with the soil-moisture content. On no-N plots in a wet year, yields fell sharply with deep plowing. Maximum yield occurred only with the simultaneous maximum provision of nutrients: deep plowing can show its greatest effect only under conditions of good husbandry. In the 2nd-3rd year after deep plowing, compaction increased and porosity decreased, but not to the level of the controls ploughed to 20 cm. In a dry summer, the top 50-cm of soil in the deep-plowed plots contained 6-14% more moisture, leading to better survival and recovery of crops. The extra moisture occurred largely in the sod layer at a depth of 20-50 cm. The greater porosity to a greater depth also probably favoured a greater condensation of atmospheric moisture within the soil. As reflected in yields of wheat, clover, perennial grasses and oats, the most favourable conditions occurred with plowing to 40-45 cm, with the sod layer placed at 30-35 cm and mixed with the illuvial horizon (B 1 and A 2B).","1953","2015-06-01 17:54:32","2015-06-01 17:54:32","","61-74","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19541900169","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further trials in 1979 dry season using the same varieties proved disappointing. High temperature (35°C daily maximum) and solar radiation (600 g-cal/cm 2/day) around harvest time appeared to be the cause of high percentage of missing hills (89%) thus, low yields. These trials also showed ratooning (tillers per hill) and ratoon yields to be unstable. To test the effects of temperature we placed two rice varieties inside the IRRI phytotron glasshouse rooms using a randomized complete block design. After the plant crop harvest, pots exposed to low temperature formed twice the number of ratoon tillers than those of normal and high temperature. Ratoon grain yields were very low in the 20/20°C regime because of sterility.

Vegetation during set-aside included natural regeneration and perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne) with or without white clover (Trifolium repens), managed by mowing on one or more occasions per year. Establishment of the successive cereal test crops after destruction of the set-aside was generally not a problem. Fertile tiller numbers were increased by inclusion of clover in the set-aside cover or application of inorganic nitrogen. The presence of couch grass (Elytrigia repens) or volunteer cereals in the set-aside covers provided alternative hosts for take-all (Gaeumanomyces graminis) and eyespot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) and take-all caused some yield reductions in following cereal crops. Management during the set-aside period significantly affected grain yields of the subsequent cereal crops in the majority of the site-year combinations. However, these effects were not as large as would be expected after traditional break crops and were frequently masked by the application of nitrogen fertiliser. Mean yields increased by 80% due to the application nitrogen at the optimum rate compared to nil nitrogen. Most of the effects of set-aside treatment on grain yield were shown to be attributable to soil mineral nitrogen content, but at some sites, infections by take-all or eyespot also accounted for some of the variation. There were no effects of pests that could be related to treatment. The presence of sown clover during the set-aside period had the most consistent effect across sites, affecting tiller populations, grain yield and grain quality of cereal crops. At some sites, establishing a sown cover during the set-aside period, or cutting the cover more than once a year, improved grain yield and quality, and reduced the incidence of some specific weeds and disease.

Eight IRRI cultivars and experimental lines were grown in the IRRI Phytotron under two temperature regimes 35/27C and 29/21C (day/night) using a randomized complete block design. While the number of tillers were greater in the high temperature regime, the sterility in the panicles were greater than for plants grown in the low temperature regime. Consequently, grain yields were approximately nine fold greater from plants grown in the cooler temperatures than for plants grown at the high temperatures. Plants were taller and maturity was earlier when grown in the hot room than the plants grown in the cooler room.

Since almost no data exist on the deleterious effects inflicted on crops by actual fallout radiation, it is necessary to extrapolate from the existing radiobotanical data concerned with the effects of gamma radiation on survival and yield of plants. A number of factors can modify the effects of the radiation and, hence, influence the accuracy of predictions of postattack injury. The most important variables are (a) species differences in interphase chromosome volume (the larger this value the more sensitive the plant), (b) exposure rate (high rates are more effective than lower rates), (c) stage of development of the plant (a complex and difficult variable to assess), (d) postirradiation time (generally the longer the time the greater the degree of damage), and (e) numerous environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, light, competition, etc., which normally modify plant growth and yield. These factors acting singly or in various combinations can have a considerable effect on the radiation response and thereby make more difficult the prediction of postattack injury. Survival and yield data obtained from irradiation of growing plants are presented for many species. The most useful values in comparing sensitivities are LD10, LD50 and LD90 (exposures required to reduce survival by 10, 50 and 90 per cent), and the YD10, YD50 and YD90 (exposures required to reduce yield by 10, 50 and 90 per cent). A log—log regression of LD10 vs. YD50 for 36-hr FDS (fallout decay simulation) gamma exposures has a slope not significantly different from + 1, indicating that, in general, an exposure which produces an LD10 will reduce yield by 50 per cent. A prediction of other LD10 values may also be made from regressions of interphase chromosome volume on LD10. Predicted YD50 values following FDS exposures are given for 89 crop plants and for 82 woody plants for a 16-hr constant rate exposure. Using these predictions and the available radiobiological data some conclusions may be drawn concerning the vulnerability of crop plants to fallout radiation. The cereals, i.e. wheat, barley, oats and maize, which are probably our most important group of crop plants, would be the most sensitive with YD50 values ranging from about 1 to 4 kR (rice is much more resistant). The legumes, i.e. peas and beans, include both sensitive and resistant species with YD50s ranging from less than 1 to 12 kR. Root crops, i.e. onion, garlic, beet, potato and radish, have a wider range in sensitivity with YD50s between 1 and 16 kR. For pasture and forage crops the YD50 varies from 2 to 20 kR. Of the herbaceous crop species 70 per cent fall in the predicted sensitivity range between 4 and 16 kR. Woody species have a range of predicted LD50s between about 0·4 and 8 kR with the gymnosperms predominating below 2 kR. These predictions are for average conditions only and we still lack a significant amount of radiobiological data to make confident predictions of the expected response of many species to high level fallout gamma exposure. Also, inadequate information about beta radiation injury and its possible interaction with gamma radiation make extrapolation to actual fallout conditions even more difficult (see also Summary pp. 112–114).","1971","2015-06-01 19:25:39","2015-06-01 19:25:39","","85-118","","2","11","","Radiation Botany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mineral fertilizers increased, and the manure decreased the acidity of the soil. The mineral fertilizers produced higher yields of winter rye than did the manure; and the yields of potatoes in fields treated with mineral fertilizers were somewhat higher than those in fields treated with manure. However, manure produced higher yields of fodder beets than did the mineral fertilizers, this is attributed to the acidifying effect of the mineral fertilizers on the soil.

In Asia the traits of the rice domestication syndrome are many but due to the remarkable diversification of rice and introgression with wild rice, few traits are consistently different between wild and domesticated rice. Reduced shattering and reduced dormancy are the principal traits of domestication in rice. Using the principal criteria for distinguishing single and multiple origins of crops, recent key research results do not support a polyphyletic origin of domesticated rice in distinctly different geographic regions. While domestication is a long-term process and continues today, a single event during domestication, the selection of the non-shattering sh4 allele, resulted in rice becoming a species dependent on humans for survival - domesticated. Here the apparent contradictions between a single origin of Asian rice and deep genetic divisions seen in rice germplasm are resolved based on a hypothesis of cycles of introgression, selection and diversification from non-shattering domesticated rice, importantly in the initial stages in its center of origin in the region of the Yangtze river valley, and subsequently beyond, as domesticated rice spread. The evolution of African rice differs from Asian rice mainly in the more restricted gene pool of wild rice from which it was domesticated, ecological diversification rather than eco-geographic diversification, and historic introgression from the Asian rice gene pool. The genetics of post-domestication evolution in Asian rice is well illustrated by changes at the waxy locus. For both Asian and African rice becoming domesticated was a single event, it was the subsequent evolution that led to their genetic complexity.","April 2008","2015-06-01 19:21:27","2015-06-01 23:53:12","","394-408","","4","174","","Plant Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Domestication; Genetic resources; Oryza; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Waxy gene; Wild rice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the substitution of fossil fuels by plants requires the selection of plant species with high site suitability, an ecologically benign farming system and high yields. This paper describes results of the cultivation of 10 energy plant species suitable for combustion. Over a period of 6 yr, yield, energy gain, and environmentally relevant substances in the plant and the soil were determined under practical conditions. Fertilization was carried out in four variants each ranging from 0 to 150 kg N ha(-1) and with wood- and straw ashes, as well as basic mineral fertilizer. Plant protection products were entirely dispensed with. The results show that, except for topinambur haulm (Jerusalem artichoke) and short rotation coppice with undersown crops, the mean yield ranges between 8 and 12 t(DM) ha(-1) and that a reduction of nitrogen application from 150 to 75 kg N ha(-1) causes only slight yield losses. Without fertilization, yields diminish by 20-40% after 6 years, except for poplars, which reach similarly a high yield level as with fertilization. The contents of the emission- and combustion-relevant plant nutrients, such as nitrogen, potassium, sulfur and chlorine, are significantly lower in poplars and willows than in grass, rye, triticale and hemp. Heavy metals, such as cadmium, copper, zinc, and lead, are absorbed differently. Hemp, poplars, and winter rye allow high-energy yields to be achieved.

For two years all the plants were fertilized with mineral fertilizers (NPK), and the annual crops were removed. In the control lysimeter, ground parts of these crops was removed. In the control lysimeter, which had no plants in it, diatoms, green algae, and blue-green algae were grown for the three years of the experiment; their density was 71,000/gram, and the increase in humus was 30 grams. Under the annual crops 56 grams of humus accumulated, and 112-154 grams accumulated under the perennial ones. The nitrogen increase in the control lysimeter was insignificant [long dash]0.004%. Even when this amount is deducted, the annual plants accumulated 3.6 grams more than the lysimeter, and the perennial ones [long dash]9.2 to 20.3 grams, i.e. between 3 and 6.7/year. The endomicorise which was abundantly developed in the roots of the iris and the perennial grasses, made it possible for the nitrogen to accumulate in significant quantities. Over the three years the irises accumulated 713-1022 g (dry weight) of roots while the perennial grases accumulated 270-306 g, the strawberry [long dash]136- . 234 g, and the corn [long dash]9 g. The perennial grasses and the irises, both of which have a sharply defined endotropic mycorrhiza, are able to enrich the loam with N and humus to a much greater extent than the annual plants which have weakly developed symbiotropic microorganisms, and this ensures intensive development of the process of soil formation under them. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Transl. from Referat.

Sampling in three outbreak areas during 1994 showed that the insect's annual cycle varied according to the agroecological zone and rice cropping pattern. In the humid forest zone, Orseolia oryzivora persisted through the short dry season on ratoons of cultivated rice Oryza sativa at a rainfed site and on dry season rice crops at an irrigated one. In contrast, at rainfed sites in the moist savannah zone the pest survived the longer dry season on the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata, while ratoons and volunteers of O. sativa provided 'bridges' between the wild host and wet season rice crops. Early in the wet season at rainfed sites, galls of Orseolia oryzivora were not found at high density on wild rice, ratoons or volunteers. The heavy infestations which developed by October resulted primarily from rapid multiplication on rice crops themselves during the wet season. At all 13 sites sampled, the large majority of galls were found on fallow or cropped rice fields, rather than in ditches, bunds or uncultivated wetland, irrespective of the time of year or the hosts involved. From gall dissections, the parasitoids Aprostocetus procerae (Risbec) and Platygaster diplosisae Risbec caused over 30% mortality at some sites by October but generally increased too late to prevent crop damage.

In some containers the evolution of the fluoride concentration in the grass was controlled at several time intervals. An exponential decrease in the fluoride concentration as a function of the time was found. The effect of rain was studied by using a rain simulator and the impact of wind by using a fan. The results clearly show the major importance of the studied climatic parameters in the fluoride release process.

The biased spectral treatments used resulted in marked differences in DM accumulation, affected the relative proportions of leaves and stems and influenced tiller and secondary stem development. Final shoot dry weight and plant height were increased approximately 2-fold and leaf area was increased 46% with sorghum under the red-biased compared with blue-biased conditions at the low irradiance level tested. Blue-biased conditions also enhanced the concentrations of amino acids (particularly aspartic and glutamic acids) and protein whereas, in contrast, red-biased sources increased the concentrations of soluble sugars and starch in the leaf tissue.

A similar effect was obtained both with cis- or trans-1,3-dichloropropene. Some other components of DD, including 1,2-dichloropropane, had no influence on clover growth in the concentration at which they occur in DD. Of the compounds not associated with DD, EN 18,133 and sugar showed a favourable effect on clover growth, but X 323 had no influence. In the untreated pots with poorly growing clover many roots had died. On the places where dead lateral roots had been attached many fungi were present in the tissue, especially Rhizoctonia sp. and Fusarium spp. These pots contained also more clover cyst nematodes and more springtails (Collembola). In one of the pot experiments poor growth could probably be attributed to an attack by the clover cyst nematode (Heterodera trifolii Goffart). The nematode level above which damage to the plants occurred was calculated at 1000-3000 eggs (larvae inclusive) per 100 ml of soil. In the other pot experiment, however, poor growth could not be explained by cyst nematodes only. In field experiments clover growth was promoted by soil fumigation with DD, also when only a few cyst nematodes were present. These observations increase the evidence that attack of white clover by pathogens is a complex phenomenon in which nematodes as well as fungi and perhaps insects too are involved. Apart from a small increase in growth at the beginning, soil fumigation with DD did not raise the yield of perennial rye grass.","1964","2015-06-01 20:32:52","2015-06-02 02:10:17","","117-135","","5","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The only major exception to this general trend has been large hydropower projects; experience has taught us that they can be disastrous for the environment. The belief now is that minihydel and microhydel projects are harmless alternatives. But are renewable energy sources really as benign as is widely believed? The present essay addresses this question in the background of Lovin's classical paradigm, which had postulated the hard (malignant) and soft (benign) energy concepts in the first place. It critically evaluates the environmental impacts of major renewable energy sources. It then comes up with the broad conclusion that renewable energy sources are not the panacea they are popularly perceived to be; indeed in some cases their adverse environmental impacts can be as strongly negative as the impacts of conventional energy sources. The paper also dwells on the steps we need to take so that we can utilize renewable energy sources without facing environmental backlashes of the type we got from hydropower projects.","April 2000","2015-06-01 19:39:44","2015-06-01 19:39:44","","121-144","","1–4","65","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the economy-wide and food security implications of three of the main policies: a ceiling on prices paid by rice consumers; a floor on prices received by paddy producers; and a subsidy on prices paid for seeds by paddy farmers. These programmes have been subject to domestic criticism on allocative efficiency and distributional grounds. We examine the effects of removing the programmes using an economy-wide model with detailed treatment of agricultural activity, land use, and food security measures. We find that the programmes make a small contribution to food security, for a modest budgetary outlay. The allocative efficiency gains available from ending the programmes are small, and may be outweighed by the potential for adverse short-run macroeconomic consequences.","February 2014","2015-06-01 19:22:45","2015-06-01 19:22:45","","350-361","","0","37","","Economic Modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Food security; Food subsidies; General equilibrium; Land use; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Philippines; Rice market; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a necessary preliminary to introducing a large scale cultivation of the above plants in the collective and State farms of the region, the Bezencuk Experimental Station studied, in field conditions on irrigated lands, the importance of black fallow, the effect of former crops on the yield of winter and spring wheats, and the practicability of growing commercial catch crops. The black fallow was found to be the best means of controlling weeds growing in profusion on old arable lands used for irrigated crops. A deep autumn ploughing (20-22 cm.), repeated in May and followed by 5 cultivations, or ploughing to a depth of 20 cm. with a subsequent deepening of the arable horizon by further 8-10 cm. + 6 cultivations were found to reduce weed infestation to 0.6-1.3 per cent. The black fallow and Vicia-oats mixture for hay were found to be the most suitable predecessors conditioning the highest yield of grain and straw in the case of winter wheat; the average yields of the latter, in a period of three years, 1938-40, were, in centners per ha., 35.0 and 32.6 for the grain, and 53.5 and 56.7 for the straw with Vicia-oats and black fallow as predecessors respectively. Potatoes (early), spring wheat and sunflower, in this descending order, when used as predecessors, resulted in lower yields of winter wheat. For spring wheat, with sugar beet and maize, as predecessors on irrigated lands, higher yields of both grain and straw were obtained than on the fields where potatoes, sunflower or soya beans were previously grown. The Vicia-oats mixture was proved to be the most economical catch-crop for production of hay; maize and, particularly, sunflower gave best results as silages. To shorten the vegetative period and to ensure a higher yield of seeds, vernalization should be used as a routine method for the seeds of the above plants when utilized as catch-crops.-H.F.","1941","2015-06-01 17:56:18","2015-06-01 17:56:18","","75-85","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19440700135","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, they appreciated the nutritious fodder that could be provided for their livestock by the sown grasses, notably clover, sainfoin and perennial rye grass. These legumes were tried on Welsh estates at least as early as 1668. The initial mechanics of innovation are explored: what were the processes by which knowledge was gained, distributed, tested and used in the decision-making of those who first cultivated the grasses? On the Trevor estates the stages of adoption included the inception of trial plots of sainfoin; observation and enquiry with several English growers; assessment of soils and seeds; parallel experiments at two sites; close reference to the printed word about the crop, in papers of instruction and books. Welsh initiators also followed patterns of imitation, in some cases based on clover cultivation already established in Wales, in others on the classic model of Herefordshire. The scale of adoption is indicated by data from every Welsh county, and for landowners and farmers at different levels of operation. The literature of improved agriculture was directly influential, as were the ties of family kinship, language and religion among adopters.

Two branched dextrans (B1355 and B1299) induced a greater increase in DNA synthesis than linear dextran B512 which was only feebly mitogenic. The activity of B1355 was greater than that of B1299 and induced a level of stimulation similar to that of polyanions (dextran sulphate and polystyrene sulphonic acid). Dextrans B1355 and B1299 were relatively poor tolerogens for the α1-6 glucosyl epitope whilst the native linear dextran B512 was much more effective. Their immunogenicity for this specificity also decreased in the order B512, B1355, B1299. All depolymerised fractions of B512 induced only minimal mitogenic responses bearing no relevance to their immunogenic and tolerogenic potentials, which declined in parallel with decreasing molecular weight to extinction at 2 X 10 4. Native levan, hydrolyzed fractions of it and perennial rye grass fructosans were all equally potent mitogens irrespective of their molecular weight. In contrast, the controlled hydrolysis of levan can, according to extent, abrogate either both its immunogenicity and tolerogenicity or immunogenicity alone.

Therefore, the development of technologies that increase upland rice yields under aerobic conditions, thereby saving water, would be an effective strategy to avoid a decrease in global rice grain production. The use of the no-tillage system (NTS) and cover crops that maintain soil moisture would prove advantageous in the move toward sustainable agriculture. However, upland rice develops better in plowed soil, and it has been reported that this crop does not perform well under the NTS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cover crops on upland rice grain yield and yield components sowed in a NTS. A field experiment was conducted during two growing seasons (2008–2009 and 2009–2010), and treatments consisted of growing rice under five cover crops in a NTS and two control treatments under the conventional tillage system (plowing once and disking twice). Treatments were carried out in a randomized block design with three replications. Our findings are as follows: On average, Brachiaria brizantha (12.32 Mg ha−1), Brachiaria ruziziensis (11.08 Mg ha−1) and Panicum maximum (11.62 Mg ha−1) had outstanding biomass production; however, these grasses provided the worst upland rice yields (2.30, 2.04, and 2.67 Mg ha−1, respectively) and are not recommended as cover crops before upland rice. Millet and fallow exhibited the fastest straw degradation (half-lives of 52 and 54 days, respectively), and millet exhibited the fastest nitrogen release (N half-life of 28 days). The use of a NTS was promising when millet was used as a cover crop; this allowed the highest upland rice yield (3.94 Mg ha−1) and did not statistically differ from plowed fallow (3.52 Mg ha−1).","February 2013","2015-06-01 19:22:03","2015-06-01 19:22:03","","124-131","","0","45","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cover crops; Crop–livestock integration; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Soil management; SPV; Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[Methods] In 2010-2011, the population occurrence and dynamics of S. fuercifera were systematically studied in the field using light-trap collection in six major rice growing areas in Yunnan, including the west, southwest, south, southeast, east, and northeast. [Results] The results show that the size of the overwintering population was smaller than in other seasons and its distribution was different in six major rice farming areas of Yunnan; mostly concentrated on rice stubble, ratooning rice and rice seedlings in wet paddy fields at latitudes south of N 23 degrees 55'164 '' and altitudes below 1 369 m. Moreover, the overwintering population of S. furcifera in the south and southeast of Yinman was more abundant than that in the west and southwest. Light-trapping indicated that the beginning of the migration period of S. furcifera was from early March to late May in the west, early March in the southwest, and middle to late May in the northeast. The migration period of S. furcifera was progressively later from the west to the southwest, south, southeast, east, and northeast. Adult numbers captured by light-trapping were lower in the southwest than the southeast and the peak immigration dates were mainly in May, June and July. The return migration peak occurred from late September to middle October.

The calculations were realized by the specially developed program BIVPROG 1 (the balance moisture program) for PC for perennial wheat (as representative of cereals), perennial rape (technical crops), potatoes (root-crops) and alfalfa (fodder crops), in its first crop year. The results of the calculations are probabilities of over fullfilment of maximum number days successive with moisture below the lower limit of soil moisture θz found out in very critical development stages on moisture for every chosen crop. The probabilities of over fullfilment were determined from quadragenarian line (the years 1961-2000) of calculations made for every technical line of climatological data and pertinent phenological station with phenological data of chosen crop and they were worked into graphs. With regards to the extent of graphical outcome, the results are worked in tables VI. to IX. The fortnightly criterion was derived for comprehensive evaluation of acquired results, the values of comprehensive evaluation are presented in table X. This table reflects that the fortnightly criterion in the years 1961-2000 was exceeded in more then 20 years for all chosen crops, also in the case of perennial wheat and rape which are considered as secondary from the aspect of their irrigation requirements. From the obtained data also follows, that the lack of soil moisture usually starts to show signs before the very critical development stages of the crop, and then often continues. The results were acquired for medium soil, for mild soil the results would be even more unfavourable. The obtained results from our driest regions evoke the concern for irrigation requirements in these regions.","2008","2015-06-01 20:43:07","2015-06-01 23:52:07","","157-166","","2","56","","","Výskyt vláhových deficitů u hlavních druhů plodin v jejich kritických vývojových stadiích v nejsušších oblastech čr vletech 1961-2000","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Climatological data; Critical stage on soil moisture of crop; Crop; Fortnightly criterion; Lower limit of soil moisture; Model calculations on PC; Phenological data; Probability of over fullfilment; Scopus; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For outbreeding forage and turf grass species like ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), such resources have yet to be developed. Here, we present a model of the perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) genome on the basis of conserved synteny to barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the model grass genome Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) as well as rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). A transcriptome-based genetic linkage map of perennial ryegrass served as a scaffold to establish the chromosomal arrangement of syntenic genes from model grass species. This scaffold revealed a high degree of synteny and macrocollinearity and was then utilized to anchor a collection of perennial ryegrass genes in silico to their predicted genome positions. This resulted in the unambiguous assignment of 3,315 out of 8,876 previously unmapped genes to the respective chromosomes. In total, the GenomeZipper incorporates 4,035 conserved grass gene loci, which were used for the first genome-wide sequence divergence analysis between perennial ryegrass, barley, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum. The perennial ryegrass GenomeZipper is an ordered, information-rich genome scaffold, facilitating map-based cloning and genome assembly in perennial ryegrass and closely related Poaceae species. It also represents a milestone in describing synteny between perennial ryegrass and fully sequenced model grass genomes, thereby increasing our understanding of genome organization and evolution in the most important temperate forage and turf grass species.","FEB  2013","2015-06-01 17:42:10","2015-06-01 23:51:53","","571-582","","2","161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000314360100001","","","","Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such soil constitutes about 30% of all the arable land of the Republic. A mixture of perennial grasses (late red clover, timothy and meadow fescue) was sown under cover of winter rye and fertilized with manure and complete mineral fertilizer. Additional fertilization with superphosphate and potassium chloride was carried out in the first year of utilization by grasses. The crops of winter rye were higher when the top layer was plowed earlier (July 15), because better decomposition of the plant residues provided more favorable nutrient conditions. The crop was also higher with a layer of perennial grasses in the first year of utilization than the second year. The largest crop of spring wheat was produced by plowing the top layer Sept. 15. With this timing of the plowing, less decomposition of the plant residues takes place, which keeps the nutrients from being washed out of the soil by the fall rains. The conclusion is reached that on sandy-clayey soils, one-year utilization of grasses is more expedient. Under Latvian conditions winter rye and winter wheat are more productive than spring wheat.","1956","2015-06-01 17:54:02","2015-06-01 17:54:02","","42-45","","(6)","1956","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19593300002909","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of the study was to find out if water management can be used as a tool for vector control to reduce the malaria transmission risk. Larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.s.,̄ the main malaria vector in the study area, developed mostly in the first 6 weeks after transplanting the rice. During rice development, a succession of anopheline species was observed. This was associated with a marked decrease in light intensity reaching the water surface as plant height increased. Minor differences in water management resulted in noticeable variations in larval densities and species composition. A. gambiae s.s. larvae were most abundant during the early growing stages and almost absent in a closed rice crop. Due to improper drainage after harvest, A. gambiae s.s. breeding was soon re-established in fields where small pools of water were retained. The results suggest that larval mosquito habitats in the Office du Niger can be significantly reduced by water management, simultaneous planting and harvesting and proper drainage of fallow fields.","January 2003","2015-06-01 19:23:21","2015-06-01 19:23:21","","71-82","","1","85","","Acta Tropica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anopheles larvae; Irrigation; Malaria vectors; Mali; Mosquito population dynamics; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There seems to be little connection between the chromosome number and phylogeny. So far the only forms with the double number which have been found in Euchlaena and the sorghums are perennials. The possibility of maize having existed as a wild plant is dismissed as improbable. An objection to the idea of an origin by mutation is that crosses of maize and Euchlaena give a series of intermediate forms, whereas characters arising by mutation behave as unit characters. An origin by human selection from Euchlaena is regarded also as improbable, Euchlaena being a highly inappropriate subject. It seems more probable that the two species have been distinct since the origin of the Tripsaceae from some perfect flowered form, except that this would fail to account for their interfertility.

The provision of forms suitable to more northerly cultivation in particular is likely to be achieved by this means and special reference is made to the perennial wheat produced by hybridizing with rye-grass. The same is now being done for fruit trees. Twenty species of small bush fruits not hitherto used either as fruit or for crossing have been collected at Hibiny. In Siberia all possible kinds of temperate fruits are found and these are not damaged by the frost. Michurin has made use of all these forms, many of them for direct introduction and all of them for hybridization. Whole forests of interesting forms of common fruits, hitherto untouched by the breeder, exist in Transcaucasia and other countries. Many of these are resistant to frost or to drought. Similar forests of walnut, pistachio and other nuts occur in the Central Asiatic republics of the Soviet Union and these, as well as a number of subtropical fruits, are being used by Michurin, whose breeding work has made possible the cultivation in northern regions of all kinds of fruits that would not have been even considered previously. Michurin's method consists of crossing forms of widely different geographical origin-the wild vines, pears, almonds, etc., of the Far East were crossed with the high-quality varieties of Europe and America-or crossing forms of very different genetic constitution, i.e. interspecific and intergeneric hybridization. Species and genera that will not cross are first united vegetatively at as early an age as possible or else crossed by means of an intermediate form. By this means he has produced over two hundred new varieties of fruits and other plants. At present he is evolving frost-resistant peaches for the central area of the U.S.S.R. and the Crimea. In apples he has evolved sorts that not only grow in such regions as Voronesh but come into bearing at the end of 5-6 years and are of superior quality and flavour. In whole areas of central and northern U.S.S.R., Siberia and the Urals, fruit growing has been made possible as a result of this work. Attention is now being devoted also to the production of artificial mutation. In 1934 fifty thousand hybrid seedlings were growing at Michurin's station and 948 combinations were made, involving the pollination during that year of 205, 057 flowers artificially and 463, 942 by means of bees. Mass hybridizations were made at other places too, 150, 000 flowers being cross-pollinated at the Moscow station, 80, 000 at Leningrad, and 600, 000 at others. At present four thousand growers are using Michurin's varieties and sixteen thousand hectares will be under them in the second Five Year Plan.","1934","2015-06-01 17:57:40","2015-06-01 17:57:40","","16-22","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19351600772","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field and plot trials showed that, when wheat or rye were sown in the autumn and lucerne in the spring, the first cutting of perennial cereals yielded grain, and the second (which was done simultaneously with the first cutting of lucerne) yielded good green feed and hay. On some individual collective farms where such procedure was adopted an additional 75 per cent (3, 000 centners) of grain was harvested; at the same time, since the period during which the perennials remain in the field is doubled or trebled, such a rotation, as instanced by the one given below, would inevitably lead to a considerable increase in the fertility of the soil and in yields. The following is a 12-course rotation used with success in the Kharkov Territory, on a farm with a cultivated area of 1, 800 ha. : (1) fallow; (2) perennial wheat (cover crop) + lucerne; (3) 1st year lucerne + perennial wheat; (4) 2nd year lucerne + perennial wheat; (5) 3rd year lucerne + perennial wheat; (6) annual cereals; (7) potatoes, etc. ; (8) spring cereals; (9) fallow; (10) winter cereals; (11) catch crops (cereals); (12) spring crops.

A. glaucum, A. trichophorum, A. elongatum and A. junceum gave a high percentage of success in crossing with soft and hard wheat. A. repens in early experiments failed to cross with wheat, but later forms were found which cross readily. As the systematics of Agropyron are not yet complete, the forms in question may represent a new Agropyron species. In the F 1 generation, the characters of Agropyron are dominant; all the hybrids are perennial and show an equal tendency to generative and vegetative reproduction. Most of the F 1 plants are self-sterile, only individual groups being self-fertile. B. A. Vakar found that the number of chromosomes of the self-fertile hybrids equals the sum of the haploid number of the parental forms. Reduction division of wheat * A. elongatum is quite normal, twenty-eight bivalents being formed; reduction division in wheat * A. glaucum hybrids is associated with such serious meiotic disturbances that the extent of self-fertility is surprising (Vakar). Some F 1 plants segregate, whereas others remain constant. As the majority of F 1 generation was self-sterile, back crossing to one of the parents was required; the percentage of success did not exceed 3 to 4 per cent. Natural cross-pollination in mixed sowings of hybrids and wheat was more successful. From the F 2 generation onwards, segregation gave rise to various forms, some with characters not found in the parents. The percentage of perennial plants fell somewhat in the F 2 generation, and in subsequent generations varied according to the type of parent; the percentage of perenniality in F 4 plants varied from none to 60 or 70. In F 5 and subsequent generations a number of valuable annual and perennial forms could be selected. Some vigourous forms, for example, wheat * A. elongatum hybrids, with many tillers are of particular forage value; perennial wheats are for grain and forage purposes. The length of the vegetative period in F 1 plants is determined by the type of wheat: Agropyron * spring wheat yielded spring hybrids and Agropyron x winter wheat, winter hybrids. The vegetative period of forms intermediate between wheat and Agropyron varies with the year. In the first year three groups are found, namely, forms with long vegetative period (120 days or more), forms not fully earing in the first year and forms not earing in the first year. In the second year all the forms eared earlier than typical winter wheat.-M.A.O.","1936","2015-06-01 17:57:22","2015-06-01 17:57:22","","21-7","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19370700060","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","The production and testing of sugar-cane seedlings","Queensland Jour Agric Sci","","","","","An account is given of the technic applied to the production and testing of sugar-cane seedlings in Queensland. From the crossing point of view, to insure an excellent arrowing season the crops must have made reasonable growth before the wet season, the wet season should be long and uniform, and autumn and early winter conditions should maintain reasonable growth and allow emergence of arrows. A simple lopping procedure is adopted to delay arrowing. Data on pollen viability, abundance of pollen and arrowing are given for the vars. maintained as parent material and the relation of these features to breeding practice is discussed. The main blood lines in use in Queensland are spontaneums at various stages of nobilization, Saccharum robustum, sorghum hybrids, and nobles. The solution method of holding arrows for crossing, and the associated use of lanterns, are described. Pre-storage drying of seed is usually by an electric dryer. The fuzz is stored in small tins at 32.40[degree]F until required for planting within the ensuing yr. Seed is germinated in sterilized soil in flats in glasshouses and the seedlings thinned out to 400-500 per flat of about 270 sq. in. When 3-4 inches high the seedlings are transplanted to pots outside the glasshouses, and when 9-12 inches high are put into the field. Seedlings are selected from either the plant or the ratoon crop, and selection is carried out in the field, where comparison of certain characters as between seedling plots and standard canes can be readily made. The measure of stooling in the original seedling stool is the number of sticks of millable cane at the time of selection. Brix figures are obtained from hand refractometer readings from extracted juice. Selected seedlings are planted in 40-set plots; further selection is made in the plant crop and is mainly on a visual basis. From 20 to 40 seedlings at each station then go into a ""yield-observation"" trial for two seasons, and the next lot of selections are incorporated in Latin square or randomized block trials and in disease resistance and district trials before being distributed to farmers or rejected for disease susceptibility or other cause. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ","1949","2015-06-01 19:13:14","2015-06-01 19:13:14","","1-53","","(1)","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19502400037382","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although they were highly sterile, a few seeds were obtained from cross pollination. After repeated backcrossing onto wheat, plants of the F4 generation are only 1% perennial. Better results were obtained by using winter wheat with high regenerative ability, and by crossing F1 hybrids with relatively fertile, perennial plants of later generations. Among the plants of the F2 generation, 30 to 35% are sterile, and with a few exceptions grains of the fertile plants have no commercial value. In the F3 generation, particularly after intercrossing between F2 hybrids, a relatively high proportion of perennial plants with wheat-like grains was obtained. In the F4 generation, only 30% of the plants were perennial, but grain quality was good enough so that agronomically valuable selections could be made. Var. no. 34085, obtained from spring wheat Lutescens 0.62 x A. glaucum backgrossed to winter wheat Koopera-torka, has spikes with a mean length of 9.5 cm., 15-16 spikelets per spike, 3-5 grains per spikelet.

The legumes were soil incorporated at various rates of dry matter (DM) or with or without harvesting of seed. Results showed that lupins ploughed intact into the soil could add up to 1.5 t of nitrogen (N) ha -1 and give yield of annual ryegrass ( Lolium multiflorum cv. Grasslands Moata), which were greater than those obtained from 200 kg of N ha -1. If seed was harvested, ryegrass yield after lupins was still equal to the yield from plots given 200 kg of N ha -1 (16.3 t ha -1). Incorporation of tagasaste ( Chameaecytisus palmensis) at 15 t DM ha -1 gave a yield of 25.4 t of maize DM ha -1. Under dryland conditions, tagasaste at 10 t ha -1 of DM produced significantly more maize DM than the control or plots, which received 200 kg N ha -1. Soil analyses showed that legume incorporation increased total soil N. Soil bulk density was reduced by tagasaste incorporation but not by grain legume incorporation. The results suggest that the crops were responding to N from the incorporated legume material in the same way as they respond to fertilizer N.

This is based on the assumption that the rumen flora degrade and inactivate mycotoxins, thus protecting the animal. A number of mycotoxins, however, resist rumen degradation, causing distinct clinical signs of intoxication. Moreover, due to their complex diet, dairy cows may be exposed to a varying number of mycotoxins, originating from different feed materials such as roughage and concentrates.

Despite historical abundance on the Roggeveld plateau, S. strictum subsp. africanum is currently threatened with extinction. Many reasons have been given for its decline, including susceptibility to rusts. Methods Leaves with stem, leaf and stripe rust pustules were sampled from cultivated and naturally occurring S. strictum subsp. africanum on the farm Kanariesfontein near Sutherland. Identity of the rust pathogens was determined through infection and sequencing studies. Results Inoculation studies showed that stem and leaf rust collected from wild rye were avirulent on bread wheat, but virulent on Secale cereale. The stripe rust specimen was virulent on bread wheat and was identified as Puccinia striiformis race 6E16A−. Using ITS sequencing, the wild rye leaf rust specimen was confirmed as Puccinia recondita, and the stripe rust specimen as P. striiformis. ITS sequences did not distinguish between Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis, respectively the causal organisms of wheat and rye stem rust. Inoculation of wild rye plants with P. graminis f. sp. tritici proved its susceptibility to stem rust races attacking wheat and triticale. Conclusion This study established that S. strictum subsp. africanum is a host for both rye and wheat stem rust, rye leaf rust and wheat stripe rust.","January 2015","2015-06-01 19:32:31","2015-06-01 23:51:09","","94-98","","0","96","","South African Journal of Botany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); Roggeveld; Rust diseases; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search.rye; Secale strictum subsp. africanum; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study site was situated in the farm of Hoshe Forestry Experiment Station at Nantou County, Taiwan. After deforestation of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), a split plot design of 8 treatments was set up: open ground without planting as control, planted with kikuyu grass, planted with kikuyu grass and Alnus formosana, planted with kikuyu grass and Zelkova formosana, planted with kikuyu grass and Cinnamomum camphora, planted with A. formosana, planted with Z. formosana, and planted with C. camphora. Field measurements showed that weeds grew luxuriantly six months after treatment in plots which had not been planted with kikuyu grass. However, the growth of weeds was significantly retarded but that of woody plants was not affected when the plots were planted with kikuyu grass. As compared with the tap water control, the aqueous leachate of kikuyu grass stimulated the seedling growth of C. camphora and A. formosana, but the extract stimulated the growth of C. camphora and inhibited that of A. formosana. In contrast, the aqueous extracts of three hardwood plants exhibited variable inhibition on the root initiation of kikuyu grass, and the extract of Z. formosana revealed the highest phytotoxic effect. The aforementioned extracts and leachates were bioassayed against seed germination and radicle growth of four test plants, namely annual rye grass, perennial rye gras, tall fescue, and Chinese cabbage and against seedling growth of Miscanthus floridulus. The extract of Z. formosana revealed the highest phytotoxic effect on the test species while that of kikuyu grass showed the least effect. By means of paper chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography, phytotoxic phenolics were identified and the amount of phytotoxins present was highest in the extract of Z. formosana but was lowest in that of kikuyu grass. The degree of phytotoxicity and amount of phytotoxins was in good correlation, indicating that a selective allelopathic effect was involved. The findings suggest that allelopathy may contribute benefits in the intercropping system to reduce the need for herbicides and to lessen the labour cost for weed control.","1989","2015-06-01 20:31:50","2015-06-02 02:09:45","","207-215","","2","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Allelopathy; Alnus formosana; Cinnamomum camphora; kikuyu grass; pasture-forest intercropping; Pennisetum clandestinum; phenolics; phytotoxins; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Zelkova formosana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its significance, rainwater harvesting in small reservoirs has previously been overlooked in large-scale assessments of agricultural water supply and demand. We used a macroscale hydrological model, observed climate data and other physical datasets to explore the potential role of small, localized rainwater harvesting systems in supplying water for irrigated areas. We first estimated the potential contribution of local water harvesting to supply currently irrigated areas. We then explored the potential of supplemental irrigation applied to all cropland areas to increase crop evapotranspiration (or green water flow), using locally stored surface runoff in small reservoirs for different scenarios of installed reservoir capacity. The estimated increase in green water flow varied between 623 and 1122 km3 a−1. We assessed the implications of this increase in green water flows for cereal production by assuming a constant crop water productivity in areas where current levels of crop yield are below global averages. Globally, the supplemental irrigation of existing cropland areas could increase cereal production by ∼35% for a medium variant of reservoir capacity, with large potential increases in Africa and Asia. As small reservoirs can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins, we also assessed the impacts of small reservoirs on downstream river flow and quantified evaporation losses from small reservoirs.","April 30, 2010","2015-06-01 19:25:05","2015-06-01 19:25:05","","264-275","","3–4","384","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crop yield; Food security; Global modelling; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Small reservoirs; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental data are presented which show that the yield of winter wheat was better in fields which had been planted in corn in the preceding year than in fields which had been planted in perennial grasses. A great deal of data also is cited showing that the productivity of the land in terms of animal fodder can be increased greatly by using the new crop rotation system of successive plantings of legumes, corn and wheat or other cereal grains instead of the old system of grassland farming involving the periodic planting of fields in perennial grasses.

It is suggested that there is a slow turnover of Ag-110m in the liver of sheep and that unlike radiocaesium, Ag-110m from the Chernobyl fallout did not become more available once incorporated into plant tissues.","September 1989","2015-06-01 19:33:35","2015-06-01 19:33:35","","81-90","","0","85","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ""ryegrass""); ScienceDirect; search.rye; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In designing and introducing crop rotations, preference needs to be given to relatively short rotations, which can be modified if necessary. High soil fertility can be assured through the use of perennial grasses, intermediate green manure crops, stubble residues and straw. For farms with relatively small land areas, three-four field rotations may be used, for example: (1) fallow-soya-early cereal crop; (2) wheat and perennial grasses-soya-early cereal crop; and (3) oats (partly as late summer green manure crop)-soya-wheat-soya. The third crop rotation system has been used for five years at SKhPK Start (Ivanovskii raion, Amurskaya Oblast'), and has ensured good conditions for cultivation of soya crops. This rotation has an advantage in ensuring a positive humus balance and has resulted in stable soya harvests. Field trials carried out between 1999 and 2002 at OOO Amurskaya Niva, in southern Amurskaya Oblast', compared the effectiveness of different green manure crops (soya, rape and oats) and wheat straw for preparation of soils to be used for cultivation of soya of the Sonata variety. The highest soya crop yields (2140kg/ha) were obtained on soils on which oats had been grown as a green manure crop. Optimum conditions for the use of oats as a green manure crop are outlined, including tilling, sowing, rolling, disking and ploughing in processes. Using green manure crops such as oats is an environmentally friendly alternative to fertilizer application, and can be used as part of an organic farming system.","2006","2015-06-01 17:47:08","2015-06-01 17:47:08","","58-59","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20063131019","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

F. and E. M. de Ledesma (of Campo La Union, Ceres F.C.C.A., Argentina) who claim that the forage sorghums can replace alfalfa and that the grain sorghums can replace maize. The abundance of sorghums compensates for their pound to pound inferiority to alfalfa or maize. Where an acre of sorghum can produce 10 bushels it will fatten a steer better than the same acre producing 5 bushels of maize. Further, 5 bushels of maize per acre is not an economic crop, but 5 bushels of sorghum is, because it can be pastured, thus avoiding harvest expenses. The central part of Argentina, famous for producing some of the finest beef, comprises barely one quarter of the whole country. The marginal land, shading into desert, is faced with a problem that cannot be solved by alfalfa. Sorghum, like any other plant, has its difficulties, and to meet them special machinery, special rotations and methods have been devised. Furthermore, a perennial sorghum-Columbus grass, S. almum has been developed. This is interesting as a perennial crop has enormous advantages in economy over an annual. Many thousands of acres of this seed have been sown during the last 5 years in these marginal lands, and it is expected to do for them what alfalfa has done for the inside cattle zone. Districts hitherto looked upon as semi-desert are now producing rich milk and fat cattle. It has also been found that where the rainfall is over 30 inches it is possible to sow without ploughing, provided the seed has some cover and defence against animals for the first 2 months of its life. This is useful in uncleared land. The question of altitude may be a limiting factor, though temperature is of primary consideration. In Argentina, sorghum has been sown up to 1500 feet.- The Spectator July 8, 1949.-M.H.","1949","2015-06-01 17:44:50","2015-06-01 17:44:50","","","","July 8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19490701281","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The changes in crop land in the principal geographic regions since 1953 are analysed to provide a measure of the impact of the programme on agricultural potential. The Tselinny Krai (Virgin Land Territory) is selected as the model for a comparative study of the potential of the Soviet drive to solve the perennial grain problem; this area was chosen because of its relative compactness and homogeneity of resources and its reliance on a monolithic crop structure based on spring wheat. The area is compared with Saskatchewan, another virgin territory. It is shown that yield in the Virgin Land territory is much below that of Saskatchewan, and is not likely to catch up in the next decade or two. Unless existing cropping practices are altered it is held that no improvement can be expected and that long term effects will be disastrous. While the Virgin Land programme was politically successful, the grain average over the ten-year period indicates that prime production costs were approximately covered, but that aggregate costs of the programme exceed returns. It is held that in the short run the venture was economically advantageous; that it was in part responsible for the overall rise in agricultural output, and that it spread the risks inherent in Soviet farming. However, since 1959, there has been a sharp regression; yields have persistently declined, dust storms have been frequent and most farms have operated at a loss. It is concluded that to restore the consequences of a decade of monoculture farming will take time, new technology, and a continuous and massive flow of capital into the new lands.

Ten weed management treatments were used to identify critical periods of competition and to enable the development of more precise management recommendations. Rice yields in 1999WS ranged from 3.2 t ha−1 with no weed control to 6.3 t ha−1 in weed-free plots; a yield loss of 49%. Major weed species encountered in 1999WS were Bolboschoenus maritimus, Oryza longistaminata, Cyperus difformis and Echinochloa colona. In 2000DS, C. difformis dominated the weed flora, and rice yields ranged from 3.7 t ha−1 with no weed control to 7.9 t ha−1 in weed-free plots; a yield loss of 47%. To assess the effects of weed biomass on the rice crop over time a linear mixed model was used. This highlighted the importance of E. colona and C. difformis in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, and of O. longistaminata in both seasons. The presence of E. colona early in the crop seemed related to greater levels of rice biomass in 1999WS, while O. longistaminata always had a negative effect on crop growth even at relatively low levels of infestation. Gompertz and logistic equations were fitted to data representing increasing periods of weed-free growth and weed interference, respectively. Critical periods for weed control, obtaining 95% of a weed-free yield, were estimated as between 29 to 32 days after sowing (DAS) in the WS and 4 to 83 DAS in the DS. The lower temperatures in the early DS resulted in slower growth of rice and weeds, delaying the effects of competition. Weed competition either before or after these critical periods had negligible effects on crop yield.","January 8, 2004","2015-06-01 19:22:17","2015-06-01 19:22:17","","31-42","","1","85","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Critical period; Lowland; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Weed competition; Yield loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households – the majority ethnic group in Vietnam – and on the other hand the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000–2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached −0.31% y−1 of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect deforestation are discussed.","October 2013","2015-06-01 19:22:53","2015-06-01 19:22:53","","1187-1198","","5","23","","Global Environmental Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural commodity booms; Ethnic marginalization; Land use policies; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); REDD+; Remote sensing; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to evaluate the pericarp colour of the grains along with yield potential and to validate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic traits. The variants were screened against blast disease. Background marker analysis was also done for the promising variants. The field trials were carried out at a single location (due to containment purposes) over two seasons using randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. A trait-based marker analysis was used to identify QTLs for validation in BC2F5 generation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the seasonal factors influenced different agronomic traits. Variant G33 produced significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher yield (5.20 t/ha) than the control, MR219 (4.53 t/ha). Eighteen QTLs for different agronomic traits were identified in BC2F2 population in a previous study. Among them 14 QTLs were found in BC2F5 population of the present study. The yield of variant G33 was influenced by several QTLs viz. qGPL-1, qSPL-1-2, qSPL-8 and qYLD-4, which were introgressed from the donor parent revealed by background marker analysis using BC2F7 generation. Percentage (99%) of red pericarp grain of G33 and G34 in BC2F5 and BC2F6 generations indicated the stability of pericarp colour which was transferred from the wild relative. Variant G33 showed resistance against two pathotype of blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae). Among the evaluated variants, G33 could be considered for inclusion in the cultivar development program for red rice with high yield potential and resistance to blast disease. This study demonstrated that the alleles from wild relative could improve the yield and yield related traits through allelic interaction, even though the phenotypic traits were inferior to the recurrent parent.","March 18, 2011","2015-06-01 19:21:17","2015-06-01 23:48:28","","232-239","","2","121","","Field Crops Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Background marker analysis; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); Quantitative trait loci; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Red pericarp; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Trait-based marker analysis; Transgressive variants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Costa Rica, it is found in the northern region of the country, mainly in the wetland of the Medio Queso River, Los Chiles, Alajuela. It is diploid, of AA type genome and because of its genetic relatedness to cultivated rice it is included in the O. sativa complex. We describe the ultrastructure of leaf blade, spikelet, ligule and auricles. Special emphasis is given to those traits of major taxonomic value for O. glumaepatula and to those characters that distinguish this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. O. glumaepatula has a leaf blade covered with tombstone-shaped, oblong and spheroid epicuticular wax papillae. It has diamond-shaped stomata surrounded by spherical papillae, rows of zipper-like silica cells, bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 40 μm in length and small hirsute trichomes of ca. 32 μm in length. The central vein is covered with large, globular papillae of ca. 146 μm in length, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The border of the leaf blade exhibits a row of even-sized bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 42.5 μm in length. Auricles have attenuated trichomes of ca. 5.5 mm in length on the edges and small bicellular trichomes of 120 μm in length on the surface. The ligule has a large number of short attenuated trichomes on its surface of 100 μm in length. These latter two traits have important taxonomic value since they were found in O. glumaepatula but not found in O. sativa or in O. rufipogon. The spikelet has the typical morphology of the Oryza genus. Fertile lemmas have abundant spines, a trait shared with O. rufipogon but not with O. sativa. The sterile lemmas are wing-shaped with serrated borders, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. All the ultrastructure characters observed in O. glumaepatula from Costa Rica are also common to the specimens from Brazil.","2005","2015-06-01 20:26:24","2015-06-01 22:23:30","","15-22","","1-2","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Anatomy; Morphology; Oryza; Oryza glumaepatula; Oryzeae; Poaceae; Rice; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); Ultrastructure; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

VCG 01213, so-called 'tropical race 4', is just one of six distinct strains that can attack Cavendish, but it is much more aggressive on Cavendish than strains known earlier in Australia and South Africa. New plantations established in the 1990s in peninsula Malaysia and Sumatra soon succumbed. VCG 01213 was later found to be common in village banana plants in those areas. It is only one of eight strains present in the villages. It is not a new mutant strain but is only newly recognised as unique. The combination of many strains and many different cultivars in mixed plantings allows sufficient banana production for home use. Yet attempts to grow Cavendish in plantation fail within a few years of establishment. Commercial Cavendish production in Taiwan, where strain VCG 01213 is present, is possible only by planting partially resistant Cavendish mutants in rotation with paddy rice and ratooning only twice. Even so, losses continue and costs are high. Permanent commercial plantations are no longer economic in areas where VCG 01213 is found. However, surveys indicate this pathogen is not ubiquitous. VCG 01213 was recently introduced into the Northern Territory of Australia, where eradication was attempted. This involved investigation of source, elimination of entire banana fields, isolation of sites, no replanting and tight quarantine. The situation here is not confounded by 'village banana plants' and is simplified by isolation and distance from the country's main banana-growing areas. In the Philippines and China, the disease now occurs in plantations situated within large areas of commercial banana production. The threat was at first not taken seriously and strain identification was delayed. Spread has occurred very rapidly in South China and less so in the Philippines. The VCG 01213 pathosystem is virtually unstudied, and its biology and epidemiology unknown. The results of experimental studies in Sumatra on incidence, treatment with endophytes and antagonists, cassava rotation, timing of infection, root invasion and breeding for resistance are reported. Rotation with cassava appears promising.","2009","2015-06-01 18:22:56","2015-06-02 00:03:29","","193-204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20093303798","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","Jones, D.; van der Bergh, I.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uptake of N was determined using 15N tracers at the growth temperature from solutions containing either nitrate, ammonium or glycine as single N sources and from a mixture containing all three N-forms. Estimates of the relative importance of amino acids such as glycine to the total N budget of plants will have been underestimated in studies where uptake was determined in single source solutions compared with those from solutions containing a mixture of N-forms. The proportion of total N acquired from the mixed N source as ammonium increased as temperature was reduced. Regarding the uptake and initial metabolism of glycine, uptake was probably the rate limiting step at 11°C whilst it was the metabolism of glycine to serine at 21°C.

Perennial grain crops could potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to result in plant types that differ substantially from all current domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes. We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with stable yield and tolerance to crowding.","OCT  2014","2015-06-01 17:17:26","2015-06-01 21:59:08","","1801-1819","","10","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000344010400020","","","","Bottleneck; Domestication; Epigenetics; Epistasis; Evolvability; Genetic assimilation; Genetic load; Perennial grain; Pleiotropy; Scopus; search.grain; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Trade-off; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, environmentally sound grapevine tillage approaches are gaining importance and one of their main subjects is the reduction of unfavourable environmental impacts. In the grapevine plantations around the Balaton Region, introduction of tillage systems based on the new concept are especially actual for maintaining the biological balance and water quality of the Lake. In order to study the effects of different tillage systems, an experiment was set up in the year of 2000 at the Research Institute of Viticulture and Oenology in Badacsony, Hungary. The experiment was started at a plot of 'Szurkebarat' variety with the permanent cover cropping of grass, mulching with reed residues, and a conventional mechanical cultivation as a control. A further experiment was set up in 2006 with 'Pinot noir' grapevine variety. Besides of the conventional mechanical cultivation (as a control), influences of permanent mulching of cover crops with low water consumption (a mixture of Festuca ovina and Lolium perenne), mulching with Carex-Phragmites-Solidago, a seasonal cover of rye ( Secale cereale) with triticale and the natural seasonal cover of Stellaria media were compared. In 2007, a plot cropped with perennial rye ( Secale cerale) was involved in the experiment. The main subject of our study was to evaluate the effects of different tillage systems on the available nutrient content and moisture conditions of soil as well as on the main quantity parameters of yield compared to the effects of equivalent nitrogen fertilizer rate (i.e. 55 kg N active agent ha -1 annually). Biggest differences between the effects of treatments could be observed in the NO 3+NO 2-nitrogen content of soil. Highest values were obtained in the plot with conventional mechanical cultivation; verifying the results of literature data. On the other hand, considering soil moisture conditions, significant differences could be observed in plots mulched with crop residues if compared to the other ones. Moisture conservation has become especially important under the extremely dry weather conditions during the last summers in Hungary. When evaluating harvest results, it was established that highest yield levels obtained in the plots of cover-crop mulching with Carex-Phragmites-Solidago might be explained by the favourable moisture content of the soil. Yield results were similar in the plot of mechanical cultivation which was also resulted from the more favourable soil moisture conditions and the high contents of NO 3+NO 2-nitrogen. For the verification of the beneficial effects of treatments applied in our 3 year experiment, further studies are needed and results should be analysed and evaluated.","2009","2015-06-01 17:29:49","2015-06-01 17:29:49","","42-50","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20103018633","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gramineous Lolium perenne L. was cultivated as a second plant after Trifolium and Lotus harvesting. Three treatments were compared: soils without fertilization and soils fertilized with two doses of poultry manure (1 and 2 g total N kg -1 dry soil). The aim of the work was to study the capacity of the ash layer to sustain vegetation and the influence of plants and organic manure on the recovery of vegetation cover, ash layer fixation and soil structure formation to avoid erosion. The ash samples were able to sustain vegetation without fertilization. The organic manure increased the yields of all the plants tested, the lower dose being the optimal for the first crop whereas the higher dose was beneficial for the second crop. The annual legumes grew very quickly. The mixture of Trifolium and Lotus seemed very suitable for reclamation of soil degraded by wildfires because Trifolium produced more phytomass than Lotus in the first growing stages whereas the development of Lotus was higher in the later growing stages. Ash layer conditions did not inhibit nodulation, which was, however, stimulated by the organic manure, particularly in the case of Lotus. Lolium after perennial legumes was the best plant combination because it produced the highest phytomass, particularly root phytomass, and thus improved vegetation cover and ash layer fixation. All the plants tested improved the formation of soil aggregates, particularly the combination of perennial legumes and Lolium. However, wet aggregate stability was higher when plants were grown on soils fertilized with poultry manure than when plants were cropped on unmanured soils, which points to the favourable influence of the organic manure on soil aggregation.","1996","2015-06-01 20:31:20","2015-06-01 20:31:20","","265-271","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Burnt soils; Greenhouse experiments; Legumes; Lolium perenne; Lotus corniculatus; Organic wastes; Perennial rye- grass; Pisum sativum; Scopus; search.rye; Soil reclamation; Soil structure; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Trifolium repens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The benefits of association mapping, compared with traditional quantitative trait locus mapping, is, for example, a relatively detailed mapping resolution and that it is far less time consuming since no mapping populations need to be generated. The surge of interest in association mapping has been fueled by recent developments in genomics that allows for rapid identification and scoring of genetic markers which has traditionally limited mapping experiments. With the decreasing cost of genotyping future emphasis will likely focus on phenotyping, which can be both costly and time consuming but which is crucial for obtaining reliable results in association mapping studies. In addition, association mapping studies are prone to the identification of false positives, especially if the experimental design is not rigorously controlled. For example, population structure has long been known to induce many false positives and accounting for population structure has become one of the main issues when implementing association mapping in plants. Also, with increasing numbers of genetic markers used, the problem becomes separating true from false positive and this highlights the need for independent validation of identified association. With these caveats in mind, association mapping nevertheless shows great promise for helping us understand the genetic basis of complex traits of both economic and ecological importance.","MAR  2010","2015-06-01 17:26:35","2015-06-01 17:26:35","","157-165","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000276191200009","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on various physiological parameters revealed that, among all the systems evaluated, rice-potato-wheat was more efficient and productive as it gave highest biomass yield (27.13 t/ha), followed by sorghum (F)- wheat, (26.1 t/ha), sorghum (F)- toria - wheat (25.0 t/ha) and sugarcane ratoon-wheat (22.2 t/ha). Rice-berseem, on the other hand, was lowest in terms of biomass potential (17.8 t/ha) and growth rate. This was largely appeared to be associated with leaf area, net assimilation rate (NAR) and relative growth rate (RGR) during flowering. Highest RGR and NAR were recorded in maize, pigeonpea and sorghum, during kharif, and in wheat, potato and sunflower, during rabi. Variation in biomass productivity among different cropping systems, were more associated with LAI (r=0.84), RGR (r=0.73) and NAR (r=0.35). RGR, on the other hand, appeared to be associated with leaf area (r=0.52) and NAR (r=0.56), among different cropping systems. Production potential of different cropping systems, in terms of wheat equivalent yield (WEY), was significantly higher in rice-potato-sunflower (21 t/ha), followed by sugarcane ratoon-wheat (16.5 t/ha) and rice-potato-wheat (15.9 t/ha) than the rice-wheat sequence (9.4 t/ha).

Perennial grain crops offer a new solution to the long-standing problems of salinity and soil erosion associated with conventional cropping systems based on annual plants. Seed yield and its components (culm number, spikelet number per culm, seed set, seed weight) were measured in 46 accessions of Microlaena stipoides (microlaena, meadow or weeping rice grass) from Western Australia and New South Wales to quantify potentially useful variation in the species. A high degree of variability was found to exist, with a 20-fold range in seed yield (0.1-2.4 g/plant), 5-fold range in seed weight (129-666 mg per 100 seeds), 2-fold range in spikelet number (14-30 per culm), 8-fold range in seed set (12-98%), and a 5-fold range in culm number (11-59 per plant). Seed yield was positively and significantly (P<0.05) correlated with culm number, seed set, and seed weight (r>0.55 for all). No correlation was found between seed yield and spikelet number per culm (r=-0.14). The range in seed yield and its components suggests that there is sufficient variation within microlaena to make selections for higher yielding lines. This variation will enable breeders to exploit genetic diversity more efficiently and identify useful accessions for further work. High priority traits for future work include synchronous maturity and resistance to shattering.","2005","2015-06-01 20:24:42","2015-06-01 23:46:47","","309-316","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Domestication; Salinity; Scopus; search.grain; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 grain) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain); Weeping rice grass; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incompatibility resulting in hyphal death was noted in A. coenophialum-perennial rye-grass associations. Incompatibility affecting host tissue, resulting in stunted tillers with necrosis in the region of the apical meristem, was present in associations of tall fescue with either A. uncinatum or LpTG-2 (Lolium perenne TG-2). Some associations were unstable with endophyte-free tillers being produced as plants developed. This instability was not confined to endophyte-grass associations showing either of the two types of histological incompatibility reactions.

We examined the results from three specific levels: intraspecific variation between perennial and annual ecotypes of wild rice, interspecific variation between cultivated rice and wild rice, and intraspecific variation between Indica and Japonica type cultivars. The annual wild rice accessions exhibited a shorter stigma and anther than the perennial wild rice ones. The cultivated rice accessions showed a lower stigma exsertion, shorter stigma, shorter anther, and thicker and wider lemma and palea than the wild rice accessions.

White clover showed similar differences of habit in northern and southern Swedish strains, the latter, if hardy enough, outyielding the former in first leys: in later leys, however, the position may be reversed owing to the superiority of the winter hardy Norrland types to the less persistent southern forms. Breeding by acclimatization has given good results, e.g. the increased hardiness and persistence of the Danish clover Morso, after selection at Skultana.

Overall, 170 species (131 herbaceous, 10 shrubs, and 29 trees) were observed. Percent herbaceous cover and basal area of trees were lower at quadrats under the bridges (p < 0.05). Species composition differed at quadrats under the bridges in comparison to distant quadrats (p < 0.05) with exotics such as Japanese millet (Echinochloa crus-galli var. frumentacea P.

We found bridges influence vegetation directly beneath them by creating an environment with nonnative, disturbance-tolerant, herbaceous vegetation with low percent cover and basal area. Differing vegetative parameters between sites were due to natural vegetative communities, while the presence of a bridge was responsible for differences between distances. The bridge was also found to alter soil chemistry and physical properties in the soil likely due to the application of fertilizer and road salts and disturbance during construction.","2014","2015-06-01 20:28:26","2015-06-02 02:10:00","","59-73","","2","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Altered; Blennerhassett Island; disturbance; exotic species; Ohio River; reclamation; Scopus; search.rye; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To establish vegetation of amenity and conservation interest on the spoil, seed mixtures of native wild flowers and grasses were sown with Lolium perenne (perennial rye grass) as a nurse species. Potentially, L. perenne is a suitable nurse species for grassland creation on infertile substrates as it provides rapid initial cover and stability, but it is non-persistent and declines in vigour with time, allowing wild flower species sown alongside to expand their cover and spread in the longer term. On very low fertility substrates like chalk marl, an initial application of fertilizer is needed to encourage plant growth. Results are reported of a fertilizer experiment on Channel Tunnel spoil to determine appropriate levels of fertilizer for establishment of species-rich grassland vegetation. An area hydroseeded with L. perenne and wild flowers in autumn 1992 was subjected to factorial treatment of four levels each of N and P in spring 1993. The results the following summer showed significant positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on L. perenne biomass and a negative impact of nitrogen on densities of wild flower species, especially legumes, establishing in the L. perenne sward. In general, low fertilizer applications encouraged low productivity and maximal species richness in the vegetation. Conversely high applications encouraged high productivity and competitive exclusion of sown wild flower species. Fertilizer applications must therefore balance encouragement of the stabilising nurse grass sward, while preventing competitive exclusion of wild flowers by the nurse grass.","1996","2015-06-01 20:31:24","2015-06-01 20:31:24","","543-548","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Channel Tunnel spoil; Competitive exclusion; Hydroseeding; Lolium perenne; Native species; Scopus; search.rye; Southeast England; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (""rye"" OR secale) AND NOT (""rye?grass"" OR ryegrass)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); Wild flower","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While high feeding quality of forage grasses is facilitated by repression of flowering, flowering should also be inducible to facilitate grass seed production. Consequently, the identification and characterization of the genes controlling flowering time in forage grasses, including perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), is of great interest. In this study, three candidate genes for vernalization response genes in perennial ryegrass were identified based on DNA sequence homology to TmVRN1 and TmVRN2 of diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), and Hd1 of rice (Oryza sativa). High sequence similarity between LpVRN1 and TmVRN1, co-localization of LpVRN1 with a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for vernalization response in perennial ryegrass, synteny between map-positions of LpVRN1 and TmVRN1, mRNA expression analysis of LpVRN1 alleles during vernalization, and the correspondence between LpVRN1 mRNA expression levels and flowering time leads us to conclude that LpVRN1 is orthologous to TmVRN1 and that its function is conserved between diploid wheat and perennial ryegrass. Of the remaining two candidate genes, a putative Hd1 orthologue, LpCO, co-localized with a second QTL for vernlization response. LpCO has recently been shown to be involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering time. While epistasis, at the level of LpVRN1 transcription, was observed between the LpVRN1 and LpCO genomic regions, no differential expression of LpCO transcripts was observed during vernalization. While orthologous genes controlling flowering time can thus be identified, future allele sequencing efforts will reveal if causative polymorphisms are conserved across the grasses.","MAR  2006","2015-06-01 17:47:04","2015-06-01 23:46:22","","481-494","","4","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000235903600002","","","","CO; Flowering time; Ryegrass; Scopus; search.rye; search.wheat; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (triticum OR wheat)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); Vernalization; VRN1; VRN2; WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to these changes, waterbird numbers have declined or individuals have moved into modified or artificial habitats. Rice, a well-known artificial habitat for waterbirds in many rice-growing regions (Kushlan and Hafner 2000), is cultivated in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) and provides habitat for waterbirds. During the 1998 rice-growing season, 300 surveys were conducted in 14 representative rice fields. Objectives included determining the number and relative abundance of waterbird species in rice fields, impacts of temporal and spatial field condition on waterbird richness and abundance, and characterization of waterbird activities in rice fields. Forty-one species of waterbirds were observed in rice fields. Species richness at survey sites ranged from 12-28 and density ranged from 4.6 to 72.6 birds/min/100 ha. Species richness and overall abundance fluctuated in response to rice growth or harvest phase and field water levels. Significantly more wading birds and shorebirds were present in rice fields during water drawdown. Shorebird abundance was negatively correlated to water level and rice height. Waterfowl abundance was negatively correlated with cloud cover. Primary activity of all birds was foraging (63%), followed by resting (33%), walking or running (4%), and nesting (< 1%). Rice fields harvested twice (ratooned) provided additional water drawdown phases. Waterbird abundance may increase in the EAA with greater area devoted to rice fields and increased ratooning of existing fields. Effects of rice farming practices on waterbirds, including chemical use and harvesting methods, should be further evaluated.","FEB  2006","2015-06-01 18:24:04","2015-06-01 18:24:04","","9-20","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI200600467827","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Annual cycles of soil water content were therefore measured in a red-brown earth subjected to 5 fallow-free crop sequences, to 2 crop sequences that included fallow, and to 3 pastures. Changes in soil water content induced by wheat, barley, lupin, pea, safflower, canola, and fallow were compared with those of annual pasture and 2 monocultures of the deep-rooted perennials phalaris and lucerne in 3 years of study. Mean minimum soil water content (0-1.6 m) seen in December and May was approximately 355 mm in lucerne and phalaris, 410 mm in annuals (crops and pasture), and 475 mm in fallow. Corresponding soil water deficits appropriate to lucerne, annuals, and fallow were 185, 135, and 65 mm, respectively. Lucerne and annuals both removed approximately 85 mm water from the upper 0.6 m of the soil profile. Differences arose in the subsoil below 0.6 m, where lucerne, annuals, and fallow produced soil water deficits of approximately 100, 50, and 25 mm, respectively. The difference in soil water deficit of deep-rooted perennials and annuals was therefore caused by the extra 50 mm of water extracted by lucerne and phalaris below 0.6 m in the period September-December. The dry subsoil endured through summer to promote the storage, by soil, of rainfall in winter. The data suggest that the spatial utility of an agronomic recharge control option in south-eastern Australia depends on the magnitude of the soil water deficit associated with the vegetation. The soil water deficit, relative to winter (May-August) rainfall, discriminates between areas where annuals suffice for recharge control, where lucerne and phalaris are required for recharge control, and where agronomic annuals and perennials are both conducive to high rates of drainage.","2001","2015-06-01 17:47:48","2015-06-01 17:47:48","","587-592","","5","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000168185000005","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The monsoon-adapted ancestors of indica-like rice were readily gathered, whether unmanaged or managed through simple burning regimes, and as such might be expected to have long been gathered or cultivated without domestication. By contrast the perennial wetland rice that was ancestral to japonica necessitated more intensive forms of management, especially in terms of water regimes, for its productivity to be increased. This encouraged water-management systems that increased in complexity and labour requirements over time and can be linked to the evolution of domestication traits in Yangzte rice between 6000 and 4000 bc. The spread of rice from its Yangzte core seems to have occurred after the development of paddy-field cultivation systems. Meanwhile in India the spread of rice out of the Ganges towards South India, mainly after 1000 bc, may also have occurred only after more intensive irrigated systems of cultivation had developed. These are inferred from the archaeological weed flora of north India to have developed during the Chalcolithic to Iron Age (after 1400 bc). We suggest that the spread of rice, which has played an important role in models of Neolithic population dispersal in Southeast Asia, may have been triggered by the development of more intensive management systems and thus have required certain social changes towards hierarchical societies rather than just rice cultivation per se.","2009","2015-06-01 17:26:45","2015-06-01 23:46:11","","88-111","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000263648700006","","","","Agriculture; China; Cultivation; Domestication; India; Oryza sativa; Scopus; search.rice; SPV; TITLE-ABS-KEY (perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice)) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a field-crop rotation, black fallow provides the greatest supply of moisture in the upper 3 m of soil throughout the whole growing period. In black fallow, the precipitation of the spring-summer period is more fully utilized, but it does not compensate for the moisture losses over the whole growing period. The consumption of available moisture constitutes 19.6 -35% of the spring supply. Under winter wheat on black fallow, the consumption of available soil moisture during the growing period amounts to 69.2 -92% of the spring supply. The consumption of available moisture by perennial forage crops during the growing period amounts to 82.4 -90.4% of the spring supply. Forage crops use moisture more productively per unit of dry weight. Moisture used by perennial grasses is restored almost wholly in the 1st and 2d plowing after the perennial forage (spring wheat sown). The effective renewal of moisture in the 1st 3 m of soil after the 1st and 2d plowing is secured by the fuller utilization of the precipitation of the autumn-winter and spring-summer periods, by reason of the improvement of the physical properties and structure of the soil during the growth of perennial forage crops. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","1961","2015-06-01 17:52:32","2015-06-01 17:52:32","","1451-1458","","(12)","1959","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19613600065755","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies from the tropical regions on possible effects of tillage and water control on weed emergence and growth in the presence and absence of herbicides have yielded conflicting results due to site specificity. Surface ponding of water in rice (Oryza sativa L.) reduces weed emergence and growth with variable degrees of success depending upon water depth, nature of weed species and time of ponding. Most studies, however, indicate that shallow ponding for the first few weeks after planting can effectively suppress weeds. Integration of herbicide in a weed control program makes proper water management more critical. However, good water control is still lacking in most parts of tropical Asia. Investigations of various tillage intensities have revealed that invariably zero tilled soils have more weed population compared with those conventionally tilledin the absence of herbicides. Tillage may bury some weed seeds and expose others that were once deeply buried. Also, repeated tillage will uproot and bury the already germinated weeds. In a diverse weed community situation weed control is effectively achieved if tillage is combined with herbicide application, because tillage is known to enhance herbicide effectiveness. There are reports of identical rice yields being obtained under saturated and flooded water regimes, and zero and conventionally tilled soils. However, effective weed control is required for obtaining such results. Investigations of interactions of tillage intensities and water regimes with weed populations have not been adequately addressed, as most studies have been confined to quantifying competition factors in terms of critical weed population thresholds. Some studies have attempted to explain the nature of competition and its mechanisms. Of the many weed species reported to grow in rice fields, only few actually compete with rice. Generally there are only three to four weed species which are economically important for rice farmers in the tropics. It is these weeds which should be essentially controlled, although total weed control is preferred by most rice farmers. Continuous use of the same control measure in some areas may contribute to a buildup of some tolerant weed species which are difficult to control. Therefore, for effective and sustained weed control, integrated weed management with proper tillage and water control is needed.","October 1996","2015-06-01 19:38:10","2015-06-01 19:38:10","","165-184","","3","31","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Management interactions; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Tillage-weeds; Tropical weeds; Water-tillage; Water-weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In PP irrigation, germinated seed is dropped into the floodwater. After 24 h the field is drained, remains moist for 3 to 5 days, then reflooded until near harvest. Little is known about water use of the PP method in comparison to the conventional Flush-Flood (FF) method in which germinated seed is also dropped into the floodwater and the field is drained after 24 h, similar to PP, or the field is drill-seeded, flooded and drained, but permanent flood is delayed for 30 to 35 days. During this 30 to 35 days non-flood period, flushing (periodic irrigation) is used to maintain seedling contact with the soil and prevent water stress. Water use of PP and FF irrigated rice was studied during 1994 and 1995 growing seasons near Beaumont, TX. Three plots were subjected to the PP irrigation technique and three to the FF method. A flow meter measured irrigation water applied, and lysimeters measured evapotranspiration, transpiration, and evaporation. The FF method required an average of 113 mm more irrigation water than the PP method, due to flushing of FF plots during the non-flood period. Evapotranspiration (ET) was higher for PP plots during the period when FF plots were dry. During the flood period, ET in FF plots was higher than in PP plots in 1994, due to mainly a lower leaf area index and a more open canopy which led to greater evaporation from the water surface. No differences in ET were found in 1995. Stomatal conductance was lower in FF plots during the non-flood period, indicating some degree of water stress. Irrigation method did not affect yield, but the PP method reduced time to 100% heading by 5 to 7 days. These results suggest that the PP method can be useful not only to suppress red rice, but also to save water and produce an earlier maturing crop. Early maturity is particularly important in areas where ratoon cropping is practiced.","February 1, 1999","2015-06-01 19:38:04","2015-06-01 19:38:04","","35-46","","1","39","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Transpiration; Water balance; Water requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatments applied in the first year were four crop residues (white clover, perennial ryegrass, wheat or peas) each subjected to one of four management practices (burning, ploughing, rotary hoeing or mulching). These treatments were not repeated in subsequent years of the experiment. Half of the experiment received nitrogen fertilizer in the third year. Wheat was sown each year and its grain yield and total dry weight of weeds were determined. In the third year, species composition of weeds was also studied. Significant interactions were found in the first year between crop residues and management practices on weeds and wheat yield. After clover and wheat, dry weight of weeds was highest in the mulching treatment while ploughing reduced weed dry weight significantly. In the second year, dry weight of weeds was not significantly different between crop residues but was significantly higher under previous year's mulching treatment. Total dry weight of weeds was not affected by treatments in the third year but weed species were affected. The addition of nitrogen fertilizer increased the density of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and dry weight of annual poa (Poa annua L.), field speedwell (Veronica arvensis L.) and some broadleaf weeds, but reduced the density of field speedwell, yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) and browntop (Agrostis capillaris Sibth.) and dry weight of scentless chamomile (Matricaria inodora L.).

In addition to the costs of weed control, weeds account for yield losses estimated to be at least 2.2 million tons per year in sub-Saharan Africa, valued at $1.45 billion, and equating to approximately half the current total imports of rice to this region. Important weeds in upland rice include the perennial species Cyperus rotundus, Imperata cylindrica and Chromolaena odorata, the annual species Euphorbia heterophylla, Digitaria horizontalis, and the parasitic weeds Striga spp. In lowland rice the perennial weeds: Cyperus rotundus, C. esculentus and Oryza longistaminata and annual weeds Sphenoclea zeylanica, Echinochloa spp., Cyperus difformis, C. iria, Fimbristylis littoralis, Ischaemum rugosum, and O. barthii cause serious losses. Common weed management practices in rice-based cropping systems include soil tillage, clearance by fire, hand- or hoe-weeding, herbicides, flooding, fallow and crop rotations, and these are often used in combination. Labor shortages and lack of access to information, inputs, and credits are widespread constraints for African farmers. To optimize financial, social and environmental costs and benefits, integrated and ecological management approaches are advocated. Locally adapted and affordable combinations of preventive measures and interventions should be targeted. Future weed research should aim to deliver the information and tools for the implementation of these approaches. This requires the generation of knowledge on weed biology and ecology and on the consequences of changes in management and the environment on weed populations. To address the diversity of rice-based cropping systems in Africa, priorities need to be set and products and information delivered that take full account of local conditions. This will require farmer participatory approaches that are inclusive with respect to resource-poor farmers and gender.","2009","2015-06-01 17:26:43","2015-06-01 17:26:43","","149-218","","","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000273139200005","","","","search.rice; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (oryza OR rice)); WOS","","Sparks, D.

Ser.","","","","","Hybridization of soft and hard wheat with Agropyrum elongatum dates back to 1932. The characteristics of the male parent ( Agropyrum) were dominant in the F 1 plants. When sown in 1933 the derivatives were late and evidently self-sterile. In 1934 the hybrid plants eared abundantly and early and were crossed with A. elongatum (unsuccessfully) as well as with soft and hard wheats and annual and perennial rye. Although the florets pollinated have not as yet been analysed in detail, it is thought that their fertility is low. In 1933 Triticum durum plants were crossed with A. elongatum. Earing of F 1 plants sown in 1934 was scanty. The 1933 F 1 plants resembled the male parent and were awned. Thus they differed from the hybrids obtained in 1932. All crosses with A. repens were unsuccessful. It is noted that the hybrids of both series were all perennial and showed marked heterosis in height; as they could easily be propagated vegetatively, a large number of clones was obtained. The chromosome behaviour during meiosis in the F 1 hybrids of T. vulg are and A. elongatum, was followed. In the hybrids 2n = 56 and during meiosis either 14 bivalents + 28 univalents or 21 bivalents + 14 univalents were formed. In the second meiotic metaphase 28 chromosomes were counted in the dyads and this suggests that the bivalents and univalents are distributed in a regular way. The further development of pollen tetrads is abnormal; older pollen loses its cytoplasm and dies. In the F 1 hybrids of T. durum and A. elongatum, the chromosome number is 49. In meiosis either 14 bivalents + 21 univalents or 21 bivalents + 7 univalents are formed. In the second case the chromosomes segregate regularly and univalents divide equationally giving dyads with 28 chromosomes. The pollen tetrads are however usually irregular and pollen degenerates. Two types of special interest were observed during meiosis in T. durum lybicum 1606 x A. elongatum. 21 bivalents + 7 univalents were formed, but segregation was irregular; in another case meiosis took place in the pollen grain instead of the pollen mother cells, and viable dyadic pollen was produced. In self-fertile F 1 hybrids, 28 bivalents were observed. The pairing is allosyndetic when 14 bivalents are formed, but both alio- and autosyndesis occur, if the number of bivalents is 28. The hybrid proved to be most interesting cytologically and is discussed in great detail. Discussing the results of cytological investigation, the author suggests that the genom D in the presence of A and B determines the "" vulg are "" type of Triticum, while its presence in hybrids of T. durum and A. elongatum results in a greater similarlity of F 1 plants to the "" vulg are "" type than to the "" durum "" type. It is supposed also that the cause of self-sterility of the hybrids is not cytological, but rather genetical. On the basis of his own investigations and on those of others, the author concludes that A. elongatum and A. glaucum are closely related to the Spelta and Emmer series of Triticum. A. elongatum is probably distantly related to Aegilops, whereas its relation with S ecale, as well as with T. monococcum, is very remote.-M.A.O.","1935","2015-06-01 17:39:57","2015-06-01 17:39:57","","121-61","","8","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:19360701448","","","","search.rye; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (""rye"" OR secale) NOT ""rye$grass""); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P.","Wheat mycorrhiza and its importance for the growth and development of the plant [English summ.]","Izvest Akad Nauk Ser Biol","","","","","In light gray forest-steppe soils, one of the mycorrhiza-forming fungi of wheat is Fusarium oxysporum. Most favorable for the formation of wheat mycorrhiza is a bed of late-emerging perennial grasses with a grass yield of 30-40 metric cntrs/ha, without fertilization, or with the application of NH4NO3 under the cultivator. On such a bed, all plants of durum and soft wheat become mycotrophic. Mycorrhiza formation depends upon the presence of dissolved carbons in the root system of the plants and is inhibited when there is a lowering of the level of illumination and when, in the presence of N and P, the plant utilizes carbons in protein synthesis. All wheat plants on a grass bed are mycotrophic. With fertilization with large amounts of mineral fertilizers and early ploughing of the bed, ca. 16% of the plants lack mycorrhiza polysymbiotic in root nutrition. Application of fertilizers makes it possible to influence mycorrhiza and yield; in this case the type of nutrition will be myco-autotrpphic. Summer wheat in which mycorrhiza develops is characterized by a higher amount of sugars in the roots, reduced oxidation-reduction potential and a high requirement for water and P. With advanced agricultural practices, myeorrhiza exerts a positive influence on the growth and yield of wheat. However, it is not obligatory to introduce pure cultures of mycorrhiza into the soil, since cultivated soils are provided with the fungi required for mycorrhiza formation.","1960","2015-06-01 17:52:44","2015-06-01 17:52:44","","230-239","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","BCI:BCI19623800015684","","","","search.wheat; SPV; TS=(perennial NEAR/1 (triticum OR wheat)); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These findings lead us re-examine the past ideas about domestication and differentiation of rice. Historically, in 1930s two sub-species, indica and japonica, were proposed on the basis of sterility in F1 hybrids between them. Soon after that, the two types were classified by the associations of a number of genetically independent traits. The characteristic associations of traits have been explained by the hybrid sterility or reproductive barriers which were assumed to comprise a set of duplicate recessive lethal genes and to be an inner genetic mechanism to lead to the varietal differentiations. In 1980s, the hybrid sterility between Indica and Japonica types was analyzed, and Indica, Japonica, and wide-compatibility type which gives fertile hybrids when cross to Indica and Japonica types, are proved to contain an allele, S5i, S5j and S5n, respectively at a locus on chromosome 6. And those gametes having S5j allele are found to be partially aborted in the hybrid genotypes of S5i/S5j while no gamete abortion occurs in S5i/S5n and S5j/S5n genotypes. Since then, the gene S5n has been used in hybrid rice breeding to obtain fertile and vigorous hybrids between subspecies, and the long-disputed problem of hybrid sterility has been solved. Also in such studies the characteristic association of traits found in each of varietal groups is better explained by founder effects. On the other hand, a large number of native cultivars of rice were surveyed with enzyme polymorphism in 1980s and later with molecular markers. As a result, profound genetic diversity is found in cultivated rice as well as in wild rice. These findings seem to lead us to the idea of multiple independent domestications of rice. However, before reaching such a conclusion, at least two factors, i.e., long-distance-dissemination of some genotypes and the possibilities of introgression by local wild rice to primitive cultivars need to be examined. Taking the two factors as well as the historical events into consideration, it is considered here that the perennial japonica cultivars which are close to wild rice in the Changjiang River basin were disseminated to East India through Assam or along the Bengal Bay, where they were transformed under the introgressions of local wild rice and formed a secondary center, from which some genotypes seem to be disseminated to colonies in Southeast Asia under the influence of Hinduism. Later some of the genotypes were introduced into China and constituted so called Indica type. This may be a reasonable picture for the varietal differentiation.","March 2009","2015-06-01 19:21:35","2015-06-01 19:21:35","","1-13","","1","16","","Rice Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Domestication; genetic diversity; geographical distribution, founder effect; hybrid sterility; Indica type; Japonica type; Oryza sativa; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); reproductive barriers; Rice; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; varietal differentiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of phytoliths from domesticated rice, Oryza sativa, indicates that rice agriculture was well developed at Qingpu by ca. 2350 BP and may have increased in intensity from ca. 2100 BP. Rice cultivation at Qingpu was comparatively late in relation to other areas in the Yangtze valley, possibly due to the seasonal intrusion of saline waters, while the cultivation of wild rice remained a prominent feature of food production in the area to at least as late as ca. 1800 BP. Results presented here support the existence of a period of overlap, during which both wild and domesticated forms of rice were cultivated, rather than a linear transition from wild to domesticated rice cultivation and the possible influence of environmental factors over farming in an area subjected to frequent flooding.","December 2007","2015-06-01 19:21:15","2015-06-01 19:21:15","","2101-2108","","12","34","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Early agriculture; Environmental change; Neolithic; perennial W/1 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; Sediments; SPV; Yangtze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infections of Wolbachia were screened by using polymerase chain reaction with wsp, ftsZ, 16S rRNA and groE gene primers and distinguished between A and B supergroup using wsp primers. Species of 15 leafhoppers and 18 planthoppers were collected and identified with 1, 14, 2, 14, 1 and 1 sp. representing the family Aphrophoridae, Cicadellidae, Cixiidae, Delphacidae, Lophopidae and Meenoplidae, respectively. Wolbachia were detected in 1377 of 1849 individuals (74.5%) representing 17 of 33 species (51.5%) of leafhoppers and planthoppers. Wolbachia had not been previously reported from Oliarus sp., Pyrilla perpusilla, Sogatella kolophon and S. vibix. The relative densities of Wolbachia within each individual were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and the result showed that the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus had the highest Wolbachia density. These findings indicated that Wolbachia are distributed throughout leafhoppers and planthoppers from Thailand, suggesting that Wolbachia dynamics in nature may be affected by ecological factors.","June 2015","2015-06-01 19:38:06","2015-06-01 19:38:06","","277-282","","2","18","","Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Endosymbionts; Habitat; PCR; Quantitative; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); Rice pest; ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Wolbachia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this savanna area, each year comprises 2 seasons-dry (April-September) and rainy (October-March). Seed crops were sown almost every month for 1 yr, and each seed cropping was followed by a ratoon cropping after the seed crop harvest. The stem-related traits of plants from different sowing or ratooning dates were studied at around 17 weeks after sowing or ratooning. For both plants derived from seed and ratoon, better crop establishment was observed when cultivation was commenced during the rainy season than during the dry season. Although sowing was undertaken each week in August and September during the most severe dry period, germination rate was very low (or zero) and even the germinated plants died within a short time. In contrast, ratoon cropping was started and plants were grown until harvest. In East Java, it is considered possible to produce sweet sorghum throughout the year, mainly by sowing, but also partially by ratooning during the most severe drought period of the dry season.","JUL  2008","2015-06-01 19:08:24","2015-06-01 23:32:18","","377-384","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000257447900016","","","","Dry season; Indonesia; Monosodium glutamate; Rainy season; Ratoon; Savanna; Scopus; search.sorghum; SPV; Sweet sorghum; TITLE-ABS-KEY (ratoon* W/5 sorghum) AND DOCTYPE (ar); TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS; Yearround cultivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides affecting crop yields, salinity may also influence biochemical composition and nutrient concentration of forage crops. To determine the effect of salinity on biochemical composition and nutrient concentration of forage sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], two varieties of sorghum, Speedfeed and KFS4 were grown under rain shelter at salinity levels of 0, 5, 10, 15 dS m -1 and irrigated when the leaf water potential reached -1 (control), -1.5 and -2 MPa. The factorial treatment combinations were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Stem dry matter, leaf dry matter and eventual dry matter yields of ratoon forage sorghum decreased with increasing salinity and irrigation interval. The reduction in plant biomass under stress conditions was found to be associated with increase in water use efficiency (WUE). Since the saline applications continued until the second harvest (first ratoon crop) as soil salinity increased, dry matter yields were reduced dramatically. No viable plants were obtained in the second ratoon crop for KFS4 variety at 15 dS m -1 salinity and -2 MPa irrigation frequency treatments. Based on all parameters evaluated in the first ratoon crop, there was no concrete evidence to suggest that Speedfeed was superior in performance, but in the second ratoon, forage yields suggest that this variety can be a good alternative in planning for forage production.","2014","2015-06-01 19:08:06","2015-06-01 19:08:06","","554-559","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CABI:20153030871","","","","search.sorghum; SPV; TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum); WOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Far less attention has been focused on rice cultivars commonly grown in the Southern US. This 2-year study was conducted to determine the effects of [CO2] and air temperature on four Southern US rice cultivars. In 2000, ‘Cocodrie’, ‘Cypress’, and ‘Jefferson’ were grown season-long in five outdoor, naturally sunlit, controlled-environment chambers in constant day–night air temperature regimes of 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 °C under an elevated [CO2] of 700 μmol mol−1. In 2000, an additional chamber containing all three cultivars was maintained at 28 °C and an ambient [CO2] treatment of 350 μmol mol−1. In 2002, a more detailed study examining both main crop (MC) and ratoon crop (RC) yields was conducted with the rice cultivar ‘Lamont’ in these same chambers with day–night air temperature treatments of 19/15, 23/19, 27/23, 31/27, and 35/31 °C under an elevated [CO2] of 700 μmol mol−1. In 2002, an additional chamber was maintained at 27/23 °C and an ambient [CO2] treatment of 350 μmol mol−1. In the 2000 experiment, all the plants of all three cultivars in the 40 °C treatment died during early vegetative growth. In the constant 36 °C air temperature treatment, all three cultivars survived to produce panicles but failed to produce any seed yield. At the 28 °C temperature treatment, CO2 enrichment increased grain yield by 46–71% among the three cultivars with the cultivar Cypress being the most responsive to CO2 enrichment. In the 2002 experiment with the cultivar Lamont, plants in the 35/31 and 19/15 °C treatments survived to produce panicles but failed to produce any seed yield. In the 27/23 °C treatment, CO2 enrichment resulted in a non-significant increase in seed yield for the MC but more than doubled RC yields. Comparisons of these results with findings from prior studies on Asian indica and japonica cultivars indicate that these Southern US rice cultivars may be more sensitive to high temperature stresses during reproductive development than previously studied Asian cultivars. These results also point to the possibility of selecting or breeding rice cultivars with enhanced capability to take advantage of future global increases in [CO2].","April 20, 2004","2015-06-01 19:37:28","2015-06-01 19:37:28","","129-137","","3–4","122","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Climate change; Oryza sativa; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil parameters evaluated were particle size distribution and soil moisture profile. Bulk density was also monitored. Because experimental plots were kept flooded throughout the rice growing period, soil conditions for rice development — including bulk density — did not significantly vary among treatments over the 3 year study. As a result, although the yields obtained differed significantly between seasons, no significant difference was found among treatment means within seasons, showing that yields were not affected by the type of tillage used. Besides, economic analysis showed that labour costs were 2.0–2.6 times higher in CT than ZT, thereby suggesting that ZT will be more economical than CT especially for small farmers.","November 15, 1996","2015-06-01 19:39:08","2015-06-01 19:39:08","","75-84","","1–2","39","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cameroonian Vertisols; Irrigated rice; ratoon* W/5 (oryza OR rice); ScienceDirect; search.rice; SPV; Zero-tillage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
